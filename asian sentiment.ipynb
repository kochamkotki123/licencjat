IMO, The Eye has gotten a little more hype than it deserves. Not to say its a bad film, but its not the scariest thing you'll ever see from Asian Horror (like Ringu, Ju-on, Odishon). The elevator and calligraphy scenes provided the scares and the explosive ending helped increase its appeal. But in retrospect, the Eye 2 was a better thriller as Qi Shu portrayed her lead role much better than Angelica Lee. The Eye is okay for 1 viewing. But judge for yourself to see if it lives up to its hype. Note: I'm not exactly sure about a 2007 Cruise's version, and especially the casting choice of Jessica Alba. She's got great screen appeal but not necessarily the range. Maybe Cruise can offer a big budget for scarier couch jumping ghosts.\",\n          \"Simply put, excellent. Scary throughout, entertaining throughout. Would recommend this film to any fan of the horror genre. ESPECIALLY Hitomi's sequence. The elevator and bed scene are both iconic and horrifying. 10/10, watch this scary movie.\",\n          \"I finally got around to seeing this movie last night (Halloween!) and found it enjoyable, but a little disappointing after all that I had heard about it. However I woke up this morning thinking about the plot and feeling genuinely uneasy about the open cupboard door in my bedroom so it definitely did its job to some extent.After checking in here and reading so many reviewers' comparison of this film to 'Videodrome' I'd also like to point out its similarities to a classic old b/w horror called 'Night Of The Demon' (1957). That film features a paper inscribed with runes which will a short time later lead to the horrible death of anyone who finds it in their possession.Similar, then, to the videotape conceit of 'Ringu'; however, the protagonist in 'Night Of The Demon' is highly sceptical of the supernatural and the film follows his gradual conversion as he realises the true horror of the fate that approaches him. Personally I found this idea more interesting and more realistic than the bland acceptance of the supernatural exhibited by the characters in 'Ringu'.So if you enjoyed 'Ringu', check out 'Night Of The Demon', a creaky horror classic! (But steer clear of the US edit re-titled 'Curse Of The Demon', which removed much of the vital exposition.)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1/10\",\n          \"7/10\",\n          \"5/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

IMO, The Eye has gotten a little more hype than it deserves. Not to say its a bad film, but its not the scariest thing you'll ever see from Asian Horror (like Ringu, Ju-on, Odishon). The elevator and calligraphy scenes provided the scares and the explosive ending helped increase its appeal. But in retrospect, the Eye 2 was a better thriller as Qi Shu portrayed her lead role much better than Angelica Lee. The Eye is okay for 1 viewing. But judge for yourself to see if it lives up to its hype. Note: I'm not exactly sure about a 2007 Cruise's version, and especially the casting choice of Jessica Alba. She's got great screen appeal but not necessarily the range. Maybe Cruise can offer a big budget for scarier couch jumping ghosts.\",\n          \"Simply put, excellent.

However I woke up this morning thinking about the plot and feeling genuinely uneasy about the open cupboard door in my bedroom so it definitely did its job to some extent.After checking in here and reading so many reviewers' comparison of this film to 'Videodrome' I'd also like to point out its similarities to a classic old b/w horror called 'Night Of The Demon' (1957). That film features a paper inscribed with runes which will a short time later lead to the horrible death of anyone who finds it in their possession.Similar, then, to the videotape conceit of 'Ringu'; however, the protagonist in 'Night Of The Demon' is highly sceptical of the supernatural and the film follows his gradual conversion as he realises the true horror of the fate that approaches him. Personally I found this idea more interesting and more realistic than the bland acceptance of the supernatural exhibited by the characters in 'Ringu'.So if you enjoyed 'Ringu', check out 'Night Of The Demon', a creaky horror classic!

            "Review: 'Another J Horror original from 2002 (having seen the remake w/Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly) which concerns a mother & daughter, Hitomi Kuroki & Rio Kanno (w/Kuroki going through a divorce mediation w/her deadbeat hubby), who have to move into a rundown tenement. Finding a job as a teacher alleviates some of her tension until she notices a pesky water drip from the ceiling which seems to never stop. Trying to get the management to help w/the issue becomes the equivalent of smashing her head into a brick wall especially after Kanno finds a red bookbag on the roof, Kuroki gets rid of it & yet it keeps coming back like some horrific boomerang. Once she learns about a death which took place in the apartment above (& if you saw the remake) the film goes on autopilot which when the reveal comes at film's end, you're already in the kitchen brewing a cuppa. Atmospheric to be sure but also so very on the nose you can't fault yourself for looking at your watch to see if the damn thing is over yet.'\n",

Part of the reason being is its failure to preserve consistency in its tonality as well as failing to sustain a perpetual cadence! The overall ambiance is fine though as it does a good enough job to set a specific mood that in return helps us to get connected to the on-screen characters and each of their afflictions and backstories!That being said if you compare this with some of its J-Horror contemporaries (Ringu, Ju-on); it comes off as a respectable attempt at best!To tell the truth, I expected much more out of it!'\n",

When they both disappeared why there was no investigation to find them? Why no one lives in that house? I have never seen anyone without the caretaker sits all day in the entrance. Why the little girl never died and disappeared instead of her mother, whereas her head was taken by the ghost in bath tub? There are many other questions arose.

            "Review: 'Hideo Nakata must have a fascination with girls and dirty water. He took the world by storm with 'Ring' which involved a creepy girl in a well, and now this. A single mother and her daughter move into a new apartment in order to try and win sole custody of her child. However, she starts experiencing unexplainable sounds and startling visions which questions her mental well-being. An interesting combination, and one that works effectively. Merging supernatural tension with a family's emotional struggle, the symbolism and metaphorical analogies of divorce is apparent. How it can destroy not just the people around you, but also belongings and ownership of possessions. One may consider the ghostly entity to be a reminder of the emotional distress you can go through during a divorce. Other perspectives may just include the fact that she moved into a dilapidated complex where her ceiling is leaking. That's right, two valuable lessons here. Firstly, if your ceiling is leaking...abandon your home and save yourselves. Secondly, if you are running late to pick up your child from school...God damn tell someone! Nonetheless, Nakata directed another chilling horror with many effective camera placements where ghostly imagery can be seen in the distance. Hitomi Kuroki beautifully acted the innocent mother, she held the film together. Really emotional scene towards the end where mother and daughter are separated by an elevator, I felt the feels. Whilst it is a horror, it's not particularly scary. It's more focussed on the family drama. The ghost's motives were extremely ambiguous. At certain points she becomes aggressive and malicious, but her unfortunate demise was her own doing. I'm not entirely convinced that she needed to be the antagonist, particularly during the third act. I can see why, it just felt rushed and spontaneous. Also the last ten minutes could've been cut to make a tighter film. Yet again, another good Japanese horror where the American remake pales in comparison.'\n",

The intensity Kanno shows in the final scenes are rarely seen by actors so young.Many comparison can be drawn between this film & Nakata's masterpiece, Ringu.  Both have young girls, who died before their time in watery graves as the \"evil\" ghost seeking vengeance, both are faceless.  Water plays an important part in both films, more so in Dark Water.

Kuroki is deeply convincing as the increasingly unhinged mother, clinging desperately to the fragments of home and family, and Nakata has captured an astonishing performance from Kanno as the woman's 6 year old child.

It all fell into place why the film's atmosphere matched that of it's predecessor. Using water as it's main disturbing element, the director brings forth a dark and dank shooting location within the confines of an apartment building. Whilst watching this film, I constantly found myself drawing comparisons to 'Ringu' simply because the mood, storyline, music and even the conclusion were all too similar. In this sense, the film lacks complete originality. Whereas 'Ringu' managed to rescue itself from ridicule by injecting an urban myth as it's malevolent force, 'Dark Water' has no such luxury. Like a friend commented, this film could've been made as a 45 min Outer Limits episode. If you're a big fan of 'Ringu', you may wish to watch this film for completeness sake. Otherwise, steer clear.'\n",

            "Review: 'The experience of watching director Hideo Nakata's 2002 release \"Dark Water\" was a bit of a dubious one upon my first viewing. That much I must admit, especially as a fan of a number of his earlier films. There's a definite air of familiarity for much of the film's runtime that cannot be mistaken or outright dismissed. Familiarity that can occasionally border on frustration in key moments. Why? Well, because this most certainly is a film not unlike others that have come before.Most notably of course being Nakata's own \"Ringu\" (aka \"Ring\"), the wonderful and trend-setting 1998 release that helped to usher in the rise of Asian horror as a worldwide phenomena. There's a bit of a feeling that with \"Dark Water\", Nakata was trying to capture that wonderful lightning-in-a-bottle twice after the earlier film's wild success all over the world. And I can't necessarily blame him... after all, \"Ringu\" is probably his best-known and most-appreciated work, and it's also just a darned-fine film to boot. And his earlier attempt to capitalize on its success through sequel \"Ringu 2\" was decidedly accomplished with mixed results. An interesting follow-up that faltered at times and never quite attained the acclaim of the beloved original.The formula's all there with \"Dark Water\" and it's parallels to \"Ringu.\" Both are based on popular novels by the wildly talented author Koji Suzuki. Both are centered on a working single- mom protagonist with a young child that is intertwined heavily in the story. Both make incredible and heavy use of water- based imagery. And both are centered upon a struggle against a seemingly malevolent spirit of a younger girl. (I believe the term for these types of spirits is \"onryo\", though I admit I am no expert in Japanese mythology.)One could reasonably argue that \"Dark Water\" is little more than a pale imitation. An attempt to either cash-in on or try to reclaim the fame brought about by the earlier film. But I do think that would a disservice to the movie. While I do have a certain amount of frustration regarding the blatant parallels between the two films, I think that \"Dark Water\" does just enough different and has just enough going for it to not only stand on its own, but to also succeed as a fundamentally solid and often creepy little tale.We follow Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki), a single-mom in the midst of a messy divorce as she tries to build a new life for herself and her young daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno), getting a new job and a new home in a large apartment complex. However, strange phenomena begin to plague the troubled mother... perpetual water leaks from the apartment above, glimpses of a mysterious young child roaming the hallways and her daughter's sudden illness. Soon, Yoshimi begins to piece together a dark and terrifying tale regarding what appears to be the spirit of a young child trapped somewhere in the building... a spirit that may threaten not only her life, but that of Ikuko as well.The strength of the film really does come thanks to director Nakata's keen visual eye and ability to build a wonderful sense of atmospheric horror and for the performances of our lead characters, which ground the film with intimate and highly emotional stakes.Nakata has a great sense of tone, atmosphere and composition. He's a master are slow-build and subtle horror, giving us a tale that very much evokes a good, old-fashioned sense of the creeps without falling back on cheap gimmicks and copious amounts of jump-scares as all too many films do. He also knows how to wonderfully build tension, and through vaguely metaphorical imagery, he creates an adequately chilling world in which the film is based. You'd never think water dripping through a ceiling could be so chilling (outside of the money you'll have to pay getting it fixed), but Nakata makes it work.The acting is also top-notch and is a big part of the film's overall success. Hitomi Kuroki makes for a loving and instantly identifiable protagonist, and even if we haven't experienced life- shattering circumstances as she has, we still fully grasp her turmoil throughout. She's just a darned fine actress and gives the film an emotional edge that is invaluable and greatly appreciated. Supporting roles from Rio Kann, Mirei Oguchi and Shigemitsu Ogi are also very well cast and well-played and help increase the scope of the otherwise very claustrophobic film.However, despite top-notch visual direction and world-class performances, I'd be lying if I said the film was without flaw. It can and does meander at times, while at others ratcheting up the pacing to near break-neck speed. It's inconsistent as a result, and that is a detracting factor. (The climax will sneak up on you from out of nowhere, and not in a good, startling way... more in a jarring \"Whoa, that was way too fast\" kinda way.) And those troubling parallels to Nakata's earlier \"Ringu\" are also where I gotta take off a couple points. It's asking a bit too much of us to not notice them, and it's occasionally frustrating as a result.Still, \"Dark Water\" is a fun little diversion nonetheless. It may not be Hideo Nakata's best work, but it's another engaging thriller from this mastermind of horror, and I can forgive it's (rather large) faults thanks to his grand visuals and the likable actors.I give it a solid 7 out of 10. Worth seeing at least once.'\n",

            "Review: 'Water, for once, is used as the symbolic catalyst of evil and death. Blood is off the hook this time, and H2O serves as the metaphor for danger reasonably well. It appears on ceilings, faucets turning themselves on, puddles on the floor, overflowing bathtubs, frequent rain, and a flooded unoccupied apartment room. Someone in authority is forever trying to explain the weirder appearances, and in one case even suggests (ready?) the kitchen faucet was left turned on 6 months ago, and nobody turned it off! That silly line notwithstanding, much of this movie is presented in a fairly eerie and effective manner.I was very touched by the three central characters: the mother (Yoshimi) and daughter (Ikuku) are very real and human; their relationship touching and heartfelt, their danger and the terror they endure from the haunting is downright scary. An object as seemingly harmless as a child's backpack becomes a terrifying threat. The mysterious, enigmatic hooded character sauntering around in a raincoat is sufficiently sinister looking, yet a curiosity to learn more about. The tragic details of this entity are revealed to the audience only when the the characters learn them. Yoshimi, the central character (played by Hitomi Kuroki), is the right choice to build the suspense upon. Her battle with madness in the face of this crisis is well executed, and sets up the story's emotional conclusion logically.The movie is creepy and eerie rather than terrifying, but relates a strange and tragic story effectively. The acting is above par, most notably by the children. The altruistic sacrifice that is made is heartbreaking. A well-told story.'\n",

But this film has made me change my mind. I thought it was incredibly creepy and the attention given to creating a truly bleak frightening atmosphere was right on the money. I saw this film before I saw the American remake with Jennifer Connelly, and I think that the original is much better. Connelly, while a great actress, didn't capture the emotional depth of the characters in the original, and as a result I found the film to be a tedious, boring disappointment. The original story is a haunting, emotional ride that stays with you.

It's not as original as \"Ringu\" but it's still one hour and a half of reasonably scary entertainment. The story is a simple haunted house one, nothing we haven't seen before in other words. Pretty creepy sound effects and outstanding performances from the actors make this better than it's Hollywood competitors. Rio Kanno is particularly great as Ikuko and Hitomi Kuroki is good as the mother, Yoshimi. The ending is actually quite redeeming, but the reason behind the haunting was explained to early and made the movie much less mystical. Pretty but not very original camera work helps to make it all a bit creepier. Unfortunately there's a bit to little scary moments in it all. You're seldom in an @rsecleansingly scary situation. If you want to be really scared, do like me and watch it in the middle of the night alone, it helps a bit.Overall, this is pretty good entertainment, and it works a dark night but it's nothing special really.5/10'\n",

Somehow it just doesn't strike a chord with me and i always leave the theater wondering what was supposed to be so scary. Dark Water is no different.The story here involves a quite common theme in Japanese horror. Namely spirits coming to haunt people. Maybe the thing about me and Asian horror is that i just can't relate to this fear of spirits that seems to exist in some parts of the world. Here the spirit is first demonstrated by strange water accumulating in the main characters' apartment. Later by other things. And all the while, i think \"This is nicely done, suspenseful. But NOT scary.\" And while i can appreciate solid film-making for what it is, i can't help feeling that when i watch horror i want to be scared.

            "Review: 'As many will be aware, this particular style of Japanese horror cinema became a phenomenon in the west, mostly as a result of the sheer otherworldliness of it in comparison to the kind of horror films coming out of Hollywood at that particular time. For many viewers - myself included - the combination of slow-burning tension, understated performances, emphasis on character and morality, and a more old-fashioned approach to a lingering terror that stresses solitude and eeriness over screaming and gore came as a real relief when looked at within the context of violent, teen-based, self-aware horrors like the Scream franchise (1997-2000), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and The Faculty (1998). It's easy to scoff now, what with the conventions and characteristics of Japanese, and indeed, Asian horror cinema having been co-opted by the west - turning horror traditions into clichés - but at the time, films like Ring (1998), Ju On: The Curse (2000) and Ju On: The Grude (2003) brought horror back to the very essentials; no more satire or irony to kill the mood, just a slow-crawl of inexplicable supernatural horror tied to a fairly pertinent comment on the nature of contemporary Japanese society that elevated the horror, as opposed to detracting from it.Dark Water (2002) was fairly hyped at the time as director Hideo Nakata follow up to the first two instalments of the Ring cycle and the underrated mystery-thriller Chaos (2000). It came at a time when Asian horror had properly emerged in the west, with the American remake of the Ring (2002) continuing the trend of Hollywood ripping off more interesting films from other countries, and turning the slightly silly term \"J-horror\" into something of a genre or a fad. I suppose this factor could explain some of the previously lukewarm reviews of the film in question; with some viewers hearing the buzz or the hype about how great these films are expecting something approaching the second coming. Obviously, Dark Water does work as a conventional horror film, but it takes some cooperation. Remember, we're viewing these films as a foreign audience. They weren't produced for us, or for our particular culture, and as a result they require a certain level of compromise in order to fully appreciate the experience. However, these films fit into a social context that may be lost on a western audience; with the sense of morality and the roots within traditional Japanese folklore really giving a tragic and entirely personal edge to the more recognisable elements of supernatural abstraction.So, what impresses most with Dark Water is not simply the claustrophobia of its images or the constantly overwhelming feeling of loss and disconnection presented by the dreary production design and monotonous use of rain; but indeed, the central relationship between the mother and daughter that gives the film an edge of social commentary and places the emphasis on the characters throughout. It's grown up horror then; a film that suggests the true horror of a mother who can't quite comprehend the inexplicable threat facing her young child, and is forced to attempt to unravel the mystery surrounding the actions leading up to these current events. Japanese horror often has this aspect of investigation, though with the resolution leaving much room for questions and interpretations from the audience themselves. It is fairly slow moving, and does require some level of patience; however, it is worth it for the continually oppressive atmosphere and gradual revelations of the script. Dark Water might not be on a par with the work of director Takashi Shimizu, the most interesting Japanese horror director currently at work; however it does have a great mood, some skillful set-pieces, intelligent characters and an enigmatic final that is open to interpretation.'\n",

            "Review: 'DARK WATER / FROM THE DEPTHS OF DARK WATER / GLOOMY WATER'S BOTTOM FROM (Lit) (HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA). Viewed on Streaming. Director Hideo Nakata (also a screenplay co-author) slowly and meticulously builds a scary psychological/supernatural drama for grownups (which means it does not have to resort to blood or gore). This is a tale centered on a multilevel battle over the protection/possession of a six-year old girl. The heavy-duty plot includes: (1) a bitter custody fight over a daughter where the father's game plan for winning is to demonstrate the metal instability of the mother (to a family court); (2) a super-stressed mother (with an apparent history of mental issues due to being abandoned by her mother) attempting to find shelter and re-employment (in Yokohama) with supernatural abilities (apparently inherited) and an overactive imagination; (3) the mother's \"discovery\" of a run-down, virtually deserted apartment house close to a kindergarten school that just happens to have a roomy, under-priced empty apartment in a set up that has her ex-husband's sanity-destroying finger prints all over it (starting with the over eagerness of a real-estate agent and off-putting remoteness of the resident manager (perhaps hired to stage \"mysterious\" happenings?); (4) an apartment house that turns out to be haunted by a six-year old girl who was abandoned by her mother (and is searching for a surrogate) and then, apparently, was abused by maintenance workers and drowned in a highly elevated water-storage tank (on the building's roof); and (5) an erratic, sluggish, and scary-looking elevator in which strange things happen especially at the film's end (there's only one of these in a seven-story building with, perhaps, 60-70 apartments and no freight elevator in evidence!). Nakata ultimately has the mother simultaneously fighting to keep her daughter from the clutches of her sort-of-shady ex-husband and the murderous spirit of the drowned girl. Just about everything that water in any form can do that is disturbing or bad for your mental/physical health is in this movie! A tour de force and a de facto advertisement for bottled water! Not surprisingly, superstitions widely shared by Japanese are cleverly incorporated into the film (perhaps, you can spot them?). Actors are well directed with attractive leading actress Hitomi Kuroki providing a stunning performance (despite being saddled with a wardrobe that does her no favors). Child actress Rio Kanno seems perfectly cast and delivers an excellent and, at times, spooky performance. Supporting male players are very good. Score is chilling. Subtitles are close enough, but you have to turn on the closed captions (CC) function to see them! Most signs/text are translated as are the lyrics of the end-credits song. Fear, dread, surprise, and suspense are generated without the usual phony audio jolts and jump-cut editing employed by movies of this genre. Highly recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD. \n",

Taking elements from his previous masterpiece, Nakata presents a story around a single mother going through divorce, and struggling to keep custody of her daughter. However, her struggle to find work, coupled with the fact that she seems, to those around her to be losing her sanity, it seems to be only a matter of time before her daughter is taken. What no-one realizes is that her new apartment is haunted by the ghost of a previous tenant, yep, a creepy little floating girl. Whether the ghost is a malevolent force remains unanswered, and the irony may be that she gives up own daughter, who she has fought to protect, so that she can stay with the lost spirit of another girl, one whose parents could not keep safe. Featuring the same tension in Ringu, although not as powerful, Dark Water is a great horror movie in its own right.oh, the dad is the comedy doctor from Ringu 2. 8 out of 10'\n",

            "Review: 'I sincerely think this is the most perfect Japanese ghost movie I have ever seen. I say that simply because it is the first Japanese ghost movie I've seen with such a strong emotional core, and such potential to scare. There are a lot of similarities to Ringu, but I think this may be slightly superior. It also has a lot of similarities to The Shining, mainly with the apartment elevator and the way the story unfolds, but it by no means takes anything from The Shining. This movie may not be wholesale original, but it can stand on its own feet, which I can't say about a lot of movies.The reason Dark Water is so effective is because it understands subtlety. In other words, it understands how to take something that could happen in everyday lifelike water dripping from the ceilingand backs it up with a feeling of terror. I'm the biggest fan of over-the-top violence and punk storytelling you're going to meet, but I can also tell you it's rare than something like that that bashes you over the head is going to scare you. There are some exceptions, but I think that the subtle delicate approach this movie had was more effective in the ability to scare someone. I for one was so terrified by this movie that I almost had to turn the lights onit's been YEARS and HUNDREDS of movies I've seen since something did that to me. There was literally not even a single drop of blood or act of violence, but the subtlety is reminiscent of how we get scared in real life. Slowly. Emotionally.Also, the other thing that makes Dark Water effective is that it doesn't resort to plot clichés or cliché scares. I am the kind of person who sees a little ghost girl and immediately turns the movie off because it's not original enough for me. BUT as I was watching this movie I realized the ghost girl was NOY an added on cliché because the Japanese seem to find them scary, but an actual living, breathing part of the plot. I've always said that it takes a lot of originality to take a genre pieceand Asian ghost movies isn't an underexplored genreand still have something different about it that makes it incomparable to the rest. Dark Waters isn't quite that original, but it's hard to name another movie exactly like it.Once I got to the ending, this movie had me nearly crying. Maybe I'm a pansy and a sap, but I don't think anyone can deny the strong bond between the mother and daughter was not well portrayed. Without that bond, the plot would fall apart. The acting was flawless and the writing was sharp.The only flaw that I've seen people give this movie is the ending or lack thereof. Personally, I love weird movies, and I think the weirdness of the ending was pretty cool and well done. It defied clichés and it was just . . . weird. *Spoilers* I think I like the fact that the ghost was not a killer ghost more than anything. *End spoilers*Does the movie leave you with any idea of what just happened over the past hour and fifty minutes? Nope. And that's why it was weirdly awesome.5/10'\n",

            "Review: 'This is going to be a rare review, for I have seen both the original \"Dark Water\" as well as an early test screening of the American remake of \"Dark Water\" with Jennifer Connelly. This will be a comparison of the two as well as a standard review.THE SIMILARITIES:Both the original and remake are about a mother and daughter in the midst of a custody battle, and must move into a dilapidated apartment building with a creepy elevator and a water tower on the roof. Meanwhile supernatural occurrences involving water seem to be coming from the apartment upstairs. These strange occurrences start to affect the mother in such a way that it makes her seem too unstable to win custody of her daughter over her competing ex-husband. Both have a similar conclusion to a plot that has doesn't drive the audience's interest other than to figure out what all the supernatural stuff is about.This is where the similarities end. Other than the above paragraph, the two films are written completely different.THE ORIGINAL Japanese VERSION:The original \"Dark Water\" shares the same creative minds as \"Ringu\" and it shows, but \"Ringu\" is far superior. It comes off more as leftovers from their creative process. It's yet another Asian horror film where the \"villain\" is a long dark haired dead girl whose face can't be seen clearly. As the plot unfolds, I get the feeling this film is going somewhere interesting. Then the end comes and it makes almost no sense. I didn't understand the actions that occurred, and when I guessed at what I saw, the motives didn't line up with those actions. It didn't communicate properly to me as an American, nor anyone else in the room with me at the time. There's a sense of a complete story being there, buried beneath the poor communication, but if you asked me what happened at the end, I couldn't say.If you see it, you too will probably ask, \"What's with the neck pinching?\", or \"Why did she do that?\".THE American REMAKE:When America remade \"Ringu\", Gore Verbinski kept the visual creepiness of the original, if not improved it. Instead, the remake of \"Dark Water\" loses some of that visual creepiness the original had, but trades it for a better and more comprehensible script, at least for a western audience. The \"villain\" isn't all that creepy on a visual level. The remake is missing the mark on creating creepy visuals that aren't tired cliché's, like submerged bodies who open their eyes suddenly in someone's daydream. Didn't we just see that in \"The Two Towers\" and \"Resident Evil\"? New material please! You know how some cold days have a misty, rainy grayer-than-gray sky that gives you a dreary depressing feeling that makes you want to get as far away from it as possible? Well, the remake has chosen to make that the setting for the ENTIRE FILM! I understand a mood must be set, and it's supposed to be a creepy movie, but does it have to make me want to stop watching the film? The remake decides to focus on the custody battle over the daughter in order to make sense of the confusing ending to the original film. This gets boring early on, yet its necessary to understand the characters' poorly emulated motives and feelings. The writers for the remake have done something clever to improve it. They created a much bigger part for the apartment building caretaker, played by Pete Postlethwaite, who does an excellent job playing the shady suspicious character somehow involved in the mystery. Man, I missed Pete. I was happy to see him.While the writing for the original \"Dark Water\" felt similar to \"Ringu\" or \"The Grudge\", the remake feels more in tune with a cheap, unimaginative version of \"The Shining\" or \"The Sixth Sense\". Where the original didn't make a clear telling of its story, the remake makes up for that...somewhat. However, the remake is overall dull and boring most of the time, and it lacks a clear sense of direction and has almost no suspense until the very end. The first two thirds of the film will make it difficult to answer the question, \"What is this film about?\". A good mystery gives us clear questions to ask that the hero wants to find out. In this case, it's the other way around. The hero seems as though she wants to ask the audience what this film is about, and they just don't know.In summary, the remake is an improvement in script, but a degradation in visuals. It's unscary, unsuspensful and too mediocre to be worth a full ticket price. I'll beat the other reviewers to the punch on this obvious pun you'll see all over Rotten Tomatoes, and say \"Dark Water is watered down.\"Original: 5.0 / 10 Remake: 5.5 / 10'\n",

            "Review: 'Besides all the psychological build-up - which is excellent - what I found most amazing about this film is the manner in which Nakata makes the drabness of urban Japan look so sinister.  The ubiquitous grey concrete apartment blocks (which become almost invisible after living in Japan more than a month) suddenly look menacing, as much as any run-down Victorian mansion in a more typical Gothic horror film.  Equally remarkable is how he managed to make a primary-school girl wearing a Miffy bookbag - which has to be the essence of \"unthreatening\" - into a convincing evil character.I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival, and the earlier reviewer was correct - nobody left early, and everyone screamed.  However, the final 15 minutes (the \"10 years after\" segment) belong in another film, and really smack of marketing-by-committee - as though the investors would not release the film with such an otherwise bleak ending.Highly recommended to anyone who has spent time in Japan, and anyone who appreciates imaginative horror vs. the gory pay-off.'\n",

            "Review: 'This movie is so cozy and atmospheric; I absolutely love the feel of this movie, I love the rainy urban locations, I love the feeling of uneasiness that pervades from that bleak apartment, I love the vintage look of the analogue film. So glad this wasn't done in digital, as it well could have been, being shot in 2003.The story is essentially about a mother going through a divorce. As her husband uses dirty tricks she begins to unravel, and we are unclear as to what occurrences are due to him and which are due to her sanity or possibly even ghosts or malevolent spirits.While the portrayal of a woman losing her mind amidst a custody battle is a very convincing one, the apartment building is basically the star of this film for me. The stark concrete walls and constant aura of gloominess just invades your brain while watching. It has more personality than even the house in Amityville haha, I just love it. It is imposing, terrifying, and has that feeling of urban hopelessness that I, for some reason, adore. Every time she leaves the apartment I find myself wishing for her to return, although it it obviously the worst choice she can make. This movie is both a personal drama and a terrifying horror movie and it plays both parts convincingly.There's not one wrong step in the whole movie. The horror is always more atmospheric than apparent, but at the same time there are still many great and terrifying visuals. This keeps the horror shrouded and tense, psychological, but when it needs to up the stakes it absolutely brings out the big guns and hits us with something scary. It never goes overboard nor does it understate the horror like some films that try to be arthouse horror do (but end up not being horror at all); basically it is a perfect mix of drama, psychological horror, and truly scary stuff. Coming from the director of the original Ring that absolutely makes sense. Also this movie sometimes reminds me of the beginning of Coraline, which I love. Like I said, so cozy- beautifully shot, morose, scary, chilling, and cozy. Will definitely be rewatching this one.'\n",

In this case, the Japanese have flooded the markets with horror films inspired by the original RING. All the films are basically the same, with a person/persons being haunted by a woman with long dark hair, dark black eyes, and who has a bad habit of appearing out of nowhere. Usually the camera will pan to pick her up, and she'll do very little except standing in the background looking all dark and scary and brooding and such. Not to make fun of the genre, but once you've seen one film, you've seen the rest.DARK WATER gives us a child ghost instead of the usual scorned female. But even our child ghost is a scorned child, so her reason for haunting a mother and her child is the same as the reasons all the other ghosts in the genre has for haunting other people. What I'm trying to say is, you've already seen it. Move along now.5 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)'\n",

His latest, \"Dark Water\", immerses the viewer in a deceptively simple story of broken families, lost children and awful apartments.  Our heroine and her tremendously cute daughter move in to the awful apartment, with lazy caretaker and eerie CCTV (a guaranteed spine-tingler in this genre).  Strange things start happening pretty soon, such as water dripping through the ceiling, sightings of a mysterious child in a yellow raincoat, and the appearance, disappearance and reappearance of a totemic red bag, which fills the audience with dread every time we see it.As the domestic drama unfolds, with divorce proceedings, custody battles and the quest for a job, the atmosphere of pure tension builds and builds until a great climactic scene which, in the screening I attended, caused a mass cry of \"Oh, sh*t!\" as we realised the implications of the little girl in the corridor crying \"Mommy\"... If that's her daughter, over there, then who's she got in the lift with her? And... relax.  The film's real climax then unfolds, with a strange, lyrical meeting between grown-up daughter and ghost mother.  This, you realise, was the point all along: a mother's love for her daughter, a lost child's need for a mother, a mother's sacrifice to save her child.'\n",

He deserves credit for trying to be different - as in Dark Water- even if the film is ultimately disappointing.Dark Water is a subtle film about a mother's love for her child and the nature of sacrifice. However, the film reminded me of 'Ring 2'; it promised much, but ultimately failed to deliver. It's plot was too episodic and frequently relied on momentary shocks (the red bag which keeps reappearing) when the plots appears to sag. The ending was quite sentimental (i.e. the closing music) and I kept expecting a twist of some sort, but this never materialised.There are some good scenes in this film; I particularly liked the dream sequence, where the mother falls asleep and water from the ceiling falls on her. It has echoes of 'Ring 2' about water/mind transference. In her dream, the mother sees the missing child.I found it harder to suspend disbelief for this film in contrast to 'Ring' which was an excellent fusion of urban myth and Japanese folk legend.'\n",

            "Review: 'You'd think with the talent behind this it'd be awesome but unfortunately it missed the mark. The talent I'm referring to is Hideo Nakata, who previously directed The Ring. It's also based a book written by Koji Suzuki who wrote The Ring.My two main problems with the movie were the characters and the story. Let's start with the characters, they're paper thin. The only two that get develops are the leads and there isn't much to them either. There is a mum and a daughter, the mums going through a divorce and having a hard time that's all you get, you know that she loves the daughter but that's it. There was a perfect point in the movie where it mentions her job but it's swiftly breezed over, I just wanted something to give the character more depth but sadly there was none. Then you get the daughter, she's 5 and goes to kindergarten. I don't mind that she isn't as developed because kids at that age generally aren't, in saying that she does become much more interesting later on. Everyone else is just there, you get a principle who's set up to be mean but it doesn't play out, you get the father in an antagonist role but isn't fully developed or given more than 5 minutes screen time.This leads onto my second problem, the story. It's not overly engaging or interesting until the last 40 minutes. You have to get past the first hour before that though, which mainly consists mention of divorce, creepy apartment, mention of divorce, creepy apartment. Occasionally it'll throw another setting in but it mainly sticks primarily to those two, I can do movies about divorce and hardship but it doesn't even bother to reason why it's happening in the first place or why the parents don't get on. Instead one of the main things the story chooses to focus on is the leaking ceiling, which I get it's called Dark Water so obviously you're going to have some scares around that. It doesn't do anything apart from drip and look dirty though, for the first hour it just drips and the wet patch on the ceiling becomes bigger, great right? It could of focused on the affect it dripping water can have on the psyche, like Chinese Water Torture which is supposed to make people go nuts. It could of don't something around drowning as well as that is pretty frightful in itself but no the ceiling drips.I can deal with slow burning stories if there is something interesting to cling onto but this doesn't have anything, which is a shame as the last 40 minutes are great. Everything is ramped up and the atmosphere becomes creepy and unsettling as well, if they trimmed this movie to around 70 minutes I think it'd work great. It wouldn't be repeating itself every 10 minutes, there are a lot of points where I had to pause this do something then come back because it was that boring. I like to think my tolerance is quite high because of all the garbage I've watched but this one made me rethink it.As I mentioned earlier this is written by Koji but it only adapts the short story \"Floating Water\" from the Dark water book. Maybe there lies the problem, not enough source material to work with, heck I said if it was shorter it would have worked a lot better even as an anthology short it would have been epic.'\n",

It is quite slow, but the climax is worth the wait.  If you're looking for wild gore and violence (a la Ichi the Killer) pass this one by.  If you liked Ringu, there is no reason you won't get a bang out of this.  One thing I never get tired of in Asian movies is the bizzare directions the plot takes. I highly reccomend this film.

Proof yet again that no-one matches the Japanese for horror and/or supernatural movies these days. This eerie little flick had me glancing over my shoulder to check that there was no-one there more than once.Although derivative (specifically Don't Look Now) there is much to appreciate here, the slow build - the feeling of dread inspired by an almost missed glance of a shadowy figure - the discovery and re- discovery of a child's satchel, the central character's dignified and compassionate lawyer (!) seemingly being three feet taller than all of the other male losers she has to put up with in the course of a film and, of course, the errant father's complete inability to put out a cigarette. The climax also has a really, really drawn out and intense scare which had my subtitle-hating wife squirming. In lesser hands (dare I say Spielberg and AI?) the coda would have been mawkish and overly sentimental but here it puts the events before it into context and (although it provides an explanation that we probably didn't need) it gives an otherwise downbeat movie something approaching a happy ending.Criticism - the movie could probably have made more of Yoshimi's feeling of abandonment as a child (which is hinted at in a flashback sequence but then never mentioned again - unless I missed something) and her (implied) nervous breakdown to raise questions in the audience's mind about whether what was happening was supernatural or was all in her mind. These are minor quibbles when you compare the movie to most western horror films but they do pull my score down to 7 out of 10. I do however look forward to Nakata's next movie with interest. Overall, if you liked Ring from the same director or Danny & Oxide Pang's The Eye - you're gonna like this.'\n",

I watched \"Ringu\" on TV a couple of months ago, and it was the most horrific experience of my life. And I mean that in the real sense: scared s***less (the topic of Ringu suits the TV-format very well by the way). So scared in fact, that much of the scariness of Dark Water came from anticipation of more of the same. Of course, it's spooky, but not so much as Ringu, because we don't get to care too much about the ghost, since there's only two people being bothered by it. In Ringu, you got the feeling that the tape could be in your mailbox the next morning. And, there you had added suspense in the end: you already knew what had happened, but you still were left in the dark as to how the curse worked. The fact that Dark Water does not have the revenge-theme makes it weaker as well, though the sentimental tone-switch at the end still has me contemplating whether that's a good move or not. Maybe a bit abrupt - suddenly the music swells, and the horror dissipates.The greatest criticism however is the near-identity with \"Ringu\". Not only in atmosphere, because that would still be OK, but also in plot! I mean, the well is placed on the roof, the bloody nail-less fingers are replaced by a swollen child-corpse, we see no face of the girl. How formulaic can you get?Conclusion: it's pretty well done, and when you haven't seen Ringu, none of the above will be of any problem, but if you really want to have the horror creep under your skin: rent Ringu.'\n",

Imagine Ring with mild and less sinister atmosphere, and replace the scary well with not scary water tank on top of apartment house. A child drowns in the water tank accidentally, and the ghost of the child starts to haunt around the house. This time there is no even special motive to haunt. Maybe in the movies of Hideo Nakata, ghosts just simply enjoy the task? So what, I say. Nothing happens in the movie until it's half. The ending is surprising, but sad and childish. I can't really understand why director had to end the movie like this. Just like in Ring trilogy, no explanation whatsoever is given to the viewer. If the movie would be interesting, the viewer could create the reason by imagination, but this movie doesn't inspire any imagination. I really don't care whatever was the reason at the end. I have better things to do. I would even say that this movie doesn't have a proper plot.Seriously I think this movie would have been much more interesting as drama. The actress Hitomi Kuroki does pretty nice job as mentally sensitive mother who has traumas in her past and emotionally sick ex husband who wants to steal her child. If we forget the artificial horror, putting it away and adding some colour to the film (even if it's left for post processing, but we really need more colour!) it might become a nice drama movie.This isn't even scary. Only in one scene in the movie really scared me. It was when the sick ex husband put away the cigarette to the button of the elevator. There was something really dark, shady and sinister in that. Otherway, I've see the children with long who stands on a dark corridor before. Hmm. when was it last time.. Oh it was in Ring.OK, putting away the lousy horror, the thing I was disappointed was the visual output. The movie should really have a bit more colour, and I've had enough of the \"bleach sky\" effect of this director. When I watched the movie by the DVD, I thought how boring. Almost no colour at all! I understand that the movie was supposed to be like this to create that effect dampness, but I already saw it in Ring and I didn't like it there either.Sometimes the bleach-sky effect can be used in creative way. I like the way other Japanese director Shunji Iwai uses it, creating feeling of nostalgy. Light shining through the screen. But this effect looks like amateur used the movie camera. And in DVD, it looks awful. Also I must complain about the DVD quality, the compression was somehow too heavy and the colours were cutting out.Not exactly my kind of movie experience. I gave 5.

A single mother, battling for custody of her six year old daughter but losing the fight as a result of previous psychiatic treatment, moves into a dilapidated apartment complex and is soon plagued by a constant dripping of murky water from her kitchen ceiling. She also starts seeing a girl around the building - one who closely resembles a long-missing schoolgirl - but is what she's seeing real or is it all a delusional nightmare?I personally don't think Nakata - or anyone else for that matter - will ever match the sheer intensity, suspense and ingenuity of RINGU (certainly not for a while, anyway) and it's unfortunate that his latest effort - also based on a Koji Suzuki novel - has to be compared to that. It's impossible not to, however, and while DARK WATER has a few chilling moments, it suffers from a woeful lack of pace and a rather incomprehensible plot which ultimately result in a disappointing feature. Acting is magnificent, with Hitomi Kuroki giving a performance to rival anything I've seen in Asian cinema as the distraught mother whose love for her child could be driving her slowly mad; and the youngster portraying the daughter is utterly flawless throughout. Nakata's direction is suitably creepy and makes good use of a chilling musical score.To be truthful, though, I'm surprised DARK WATER has had the mass critical acclaim it has. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and plan to watch it again soon but, as a horror movie, it just doesn't deliver. The scares are definitely scary - there's just too few of them - and while this works as a drama, horror fans may be disappointed. Not the next RINGU, I'm afraid.  *** / *****'\n",

She also starts seeing a girl around the building - one who closely resembles a long-missing schoolgirl - but is what she's seeing real or is it all a delusional nightmare?I personally don't think Nakata - or anyone else for that matter - will ever match the sheer intensity, suspense and ingenuity of RINGU (certainly not for a while, anyway) and it's unfortunate that his latest effort - also based on a Koji Suzuki novel - has to be compared to that. It's impossible not to, however, and while DARK WATER has a few chilling moments, it suffers from a woeful lack of pace and a rather incomprehensible plot which ultimately result in a disappointing feature. Acting is magnificent, with Hitomi Kuroki giving a performance to rival anything I've seen in Asian cinema as the distraught mother whose love for her child could be driving her slowly mad; and the youngster portraying the daughter is utterly flawless throughout. Nakata's direction is suitably creepy and makes good use of a chilling musical score.To be truthful, though, I'm surprised DARK WATER has had the mass critical acclaim it has. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and plan to watch it again soon but, as a horror movie, it just doesn't deliver. The scares are definitely scary - there's just too few of them - and while this works as a drama, horror fans may be disappointed. Not the next RINGU. *** / *****'\n",

            "Review: 'First of all, let me address the neverending comparison of Dark Water to Ringu.  There is a single scene near the end of Ringu that I don't believe will ever be matched when it comes to scaring the living daylights out of me.  I literally moved  few inches in my seat when it happened, and even though Dark Water has some fairly good scare scenes, nothing matches Ringu for that single scene.Having said that, Dark Water is an incredible movie that offers more scares throughout than Ringu did.  From the moment Ikuko and her mom walk into the apartment complex, you know the place isn't exactly right, and strange happenings are thrown at you frequently enough that it doesn't get stale for a majority of the movie.  There are a few choice scenes that made me jump pretty good, and overall Dark Water keeps a consistently spooky tone that keeps you hooked until the very end.  Some people weren't happy with the ending, and I tend to agree that it seems more tacked on than it probably could have.  Having said that, I don't think it took anything away from the film and if anything it offered some closure that you don't normally see in horror films. I would highly recommend Dark Water if you were a fan of Ringu.  Both films are spectacular examples of what movies that don't depend on blood and guts and scores of murdered teenagers can accomplish.'\n",

Another little bit disappointing thing is that it looked like another sequel to Ringu, just that the girl looks younger, but overall the movie is entertaining with a few good scaring scenes but less scaring then Ringu in my opinion, i hope the out coming JUON will be more impressive coming out in January 2003.Oh and by the way, i would like to comment also the ridiculous comment of Jeepers creepers and frailty great movies, euh lol if you compare those to the Japanese Ringu's and same style movies like Phone then you need to learn much more about horror or give at least names like The Shining if you are start talking about masterpieces, especially that i am a big fan of Gina Philips since Breaking Free (main actress for Jeepers Creepers) but was an extremely disappointing movie an really i am defending the Japanese horror because they have new idea's and great scaring scenes in a lot of movies, we need to take some serious lessons, then perhaps we will stop to make such bad movies like Jeepers Creepers but there was worse St-Valentine, this one should win the Oscar of worst of them :)'\n",

I didn't even know what the movie was going to be before it came on.As a fan of the Ring trilogy, The Eye, and Asian horror in general, I was pleasantly surprised to see it was Hideo Nakata's Dark Water.I wasn't disappointed.  This has all the disturbing hallmarks of Ringu et al.  However, it is also a very thoughtful and moving essay on the problems of single parenthood, the effects of divorce on children and rejection.Hitomi Kuroki struggles to maintain custody of her daughter whilst sending her to a school with abusive teachers, trying also to hold down a job.  All the while, the ceiling to her apartment in a run down tenement block is dramatically leaking water.We feel total sympathy for them both as their initial enthusiasm falls into fatigue at their situation.Oh, did I also mention there is also the ghost of a little girl on the prowl.This film succeeds on two levels.  As a social commentary in a similar vein to Urban Ghost Story, and as a truly scary experience.Hideo Nakata uses all the techniques he showed in Ringu to give us a genuinely disturbing experience.  The Eastern style of acting is not to everyone's taste, but it is high quality nonetheless.Disturbing and thought provoking, it will resonate in your mind long afterwards.  Don't miss it.'\n",

The only horror film child I've ever found remotely intimidating or frightening was the girl from The Exorcist. Creepy crab walking scene. Polluted water and a neglected, stupid child are not enough to qualify as frightening.

There were a few moments in the film which I found a little creepy, but there was nothing there that got right under my skin and made it crawl. I mean, personally, I don't find water very scary for one thing. Also, I felt that this was another horror movie labouring under the impression that little kids are scary. I'm sorry, but I just don't see what's meant to be so frightening about them. This was a ghost story that delivered little in the way of horror - at least from my perspective. I found the ghost in Takashi Shimizu's remake of The Grudge to be far scarier and more frightening than the ghost in this particular story.Still, although the horror wasn't quite up to par, there were many elements of the film I still enjoyed. The lead performances given by Hitomi Kuroki and Rio Kanno were really good, they really fleshed out the film. The soundtrack was pretty good too. It definitely lent a certain tension to the story.Overall, although I didn't find the film particularly horrific in any way, it still kept my attention until the end.

So, after thinking 'Ringu' was a quit OK movie, but really nothing much more than OK, I decided to give this Dark Water a change. But I wish I didn't. It wasted my precious time. Is this horror? No, it's not, it's not even trying to be or even get scary. Is it drama? No it's not, because the story is way to undevelopped to get in touch with the characters. I don't say it's badly acted, it's not the actress' fault the script is lowsy. Is it boring? Hell yeah. We see the same ringu girl but with a different name. Long black hair and too shy to show her face. Next time, it might be a good idea to actually spent 100 yen extra on the hairdresser. Perhaps, they can do something different with the cheap looking haircut than. I'm not used to not sitting movies out, so in being rather curious of what the outcome might be I just waited, and waited and waited. And when it finally came, I realized it was absolutely not worth the wait for. People call this absolutely terrifying. Beyond believe horror. Outstanding film-making. But come'on. This film has basically no soundtrack, no original story, what the heck, the story's just too doll. The style on itself is not particularly special or unseen. It's plane... just ordinary. Nothing big or even remotely masterpiece about this film. I'm getting sick of hearing that Asian cinema is the best horror you'll find out there. I'm getting sick of hearing that films like Ichi the Killer are OUTSTANDING, because they are not. They have lack of story and originality. It's not because it's foreign that it's good. I'm no all American All star, I'm a guy that lives and works in belgium. I like movies. I like good movies and bad movies. And I agree that everyone has his/her own taste. But a masterpiece is a masterpiece. It's about movie making, and storytelling and editing. As I said before. This is plane, and cheap storytelling and therefor I give it a plane rating 5/10. There's nothing that made it bad, but nothing that made it good either. Next time you want to scare me... show me a hairless perhaps even smiling Japanese kid. As I will be surprised, I might be even scared!'\n",

The scares get more and more disturbing until it lets loose an amazing terror at the climax.

The relationship between the mother and daughter is beautiful, and realistic beyond anything I've seen in most movies. But this is a horror movie, and it sets out and performs what it is supposed to do. And the fact that the characters are so well developed makes their situation that much more horrible. Mitsuko is a terrifying presence throughout the movie, and though she is made sympathetic, it doesn't take the horror that she is putting Yoshimi and her daughter through. I was cowering by the time the film reached its climax, and almost crying at the final scene, which is creepy, but mostly beautiful and touching on many levels. Why are you still reading this?

            "Review: 'Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) works for a social services agency in Tokyo, although she's never seen any clients. When a new case comes in and they're short on staff, her boss has to send her out. Her first case is a doozy. When she enters the client's home, no one seems to be there, and the house is a mess. She hears scraping on a door--the old woman she is to care for is there, but in a semi-catatonic state. Soon after, she learns that there is much more wrong than bad housekeeping and a neglected old woman. There just may be threatening supernatural forces behind the scenes.This film is really the third in the Japanese Ju-On series. I won't usually watch a series out of order, but this is the only Ju-On film officially and thus easily available in the U.S. I was very anxious to watch the American remake, The Grudge (2004), and actually watched it the day before watching this film.The first 40-something minutes are closest to the American remake, but it was surprising that this film is much more linear. It's also more episodic. Neither of those facts are negative here, and both lend to a somewhat easier understanding of the broader mythology behind the Ju-On \"monsters\", which is presented much more clearly in this film. However, the episodic nature also means that the viewer has to pay attention to the various characters and their names, or there is a good chance that one will get lost--this story touches on many different people, in many different scenarios. Occasionally, there are characters brought into each other's episodes, sometimes as subtly as a name mentioned in a news report. These cross-references, which can also slightly break the linear timeline, are effective if one is alert.There are things that writer/director Takashi Shimizu does better in this version, and things he does better in the American version. In this version, I loved the brutal opening sequence. Although it's somewhat present towards the end of the American version, it is much more effective here. I enjoyed the more traditional Japanese home--this film was shot on location in an actual house, whereas the American remake was shot on a house constructed on a soundstage. The Japanese house is more claustrophobic. On the other hand, the soundstage house was a bit grungier, which works nicely in the context of the remake. I liked this film's transition in the famous \"stair crawling\" scene (although I thought the flashbacks weren't necessary), and I also loved some of the more dissonant music here.The biggest differences occur after the first forty minutes, when Shimizu expands the number of monsters. The film seems to threaten a Romero-like plague that I'd like to see explored more in other Ju-On films (if that hasn't been done already).The bottom line though is that this is a nicely atmospheric horror film, with a creepy scene per minute. There were a couple very minor flaws--occasionally awkward performances or editing being the primary one, but overall this is highly recommended. It earned a 9 out of 10 from me.'\n",

            "Review: 'Although the word \"grudge\" doesn't quite fit the bill as part of the title of a horror film -- one thinks THE CURSE would have been more appropriate but such is the \"curse\" of translation -- JU ON holds up extremely well as a horror film. Built upon a notion that when someone dies victim of extreme rage, the emotions are left behind and this overpowering, negative emotion will kill anyone who comes into the house, JU ON first gives us a grainy montage at the start of the story of what seems to be a man killing away his entire family. This sets the events that come next, told in a non-linear way so as to disorient the viewer of what has happened/will happen like for example, why is the old lady seemingly living in squalor in this otherwise impersonal looking place, and what part does her most recent caretaker, Rika (Megumi Okina) have to play there?I've always believed that using subtly disturbing images instead of bringing the horror up front in a broad manner creates more of a punch for the viewer. Amping up the dread, even when the horror seems inevitable, creates a sensation of anguish because one knows that something is terribly out of kilter in this house. What director Shimizu does here with introducing the old lady in the unkempt house by having us see her hands weakly bang on the rice door, and then having her stare vacantly out to nowhere as Rika tries to clean up the place only to later meet the entities in the house, is unsettling as anything else that comes later. She whispers, mantra-like, something closely rendered to an \"I told you so\" and one only has to see the mounting horror in her old eyes to know something horrible is about to happen to her while Rika witnesses this and faints in horror. It doesn't matter that one sees the little boy running around and then mutely screaming in that cat-like shriek, or the shadow and croak of someone even worse... it's the inexorability in which this curse comes forth and attacks this old, defenseless lady, and then each person who has come/will come in contact with it, and when it becomes clear that the curse is not bound only to the haunted house but is in fact a growing web of death, the rug gets neatly pulled out from the viewer's feet, because safe becomes only a word and something wicked this way comes.This is a film that people will love or hate. I don't think there will be an in-between feeling. The way that these ghosts manifest themselves as if they were part of the living, leaving hand-prints and footprints behind, the way that horror draws itself on screen -- in barely there suggestions like when Rika is wheel-chairing an elderly man who is making faces; we see the one second reflection on a glass door of Toshio, the malevolent boy --, the way the actors react to fear which is anti-Hollywood, the non-use of swelling music but the use of eerie sounds, this is one very spooky film which can stand aside some of the greatest ever filmed. Quiet yet intense, relying on atmosphere and dread, JU ON is very chilling, and very effective. This is the horror that is rarely done today.'\n",

            "Review: '\"Ju-On, The Grudge\" is not an easy movie to find in America (or at least it wasn't when I first wrote this review) , and after hearing it hyped to the heavens in magazines such as Fangoria and Rue Morgue, and by word of mouth as well, I knew I had to see it. I finally tracked it down in LA and watched it the very first chance I got to do so. Ju-On is a chapter story about a haunted house in a Tokyo suburb. The film begins when an inexperienced social worker shows up at the house and comes face to face with the horror within. The story jumps around from past to present, its chapters focusing on one character at a time until it has come full circle. Everyone unwise enough to enter the cursed house winds up dead, the haunting spreading like a virus. It seems that a terrible murder once took place in this house and the rage surrounding the act of violence has spawned its own evil curse. To enter the house is to be immediately infected and the haunting follows people home, driving them to near madness before dragging them away, never to be seen again. Ju-On bears more than a passing resemblance to its popular predecessor \"Ringu\" and is nowhere near as frightening, but it's not a bad film by any means. Butchered mother-ghost Kayako is very Sadako-like, crawling around with her long black hair in her face and moving with unearthly jerkiness. Her blue-white face is quite startling with its huge staring eyes and occasional splashes of blood. Her ghost son, Toshio, is both sad and frightening, appearing both as a normal boy and a pale, wide-eyed ghost. Many of the films most frightening sequences feature the murdered woman Kayako: her head full of black hair peeking around a corner, her shadow moving down a corridor and filling a security camera, a head-on shot of her crawling through an attic at night with only the beam of a flashlight illuminating her. The sound effects are quite disturbing as well and the performances are convincingly well done.I wasn't as scared by this movie as had been promised I would be, but that's what happens when you buy into the hype. I was simply expecting too much, and I got a pretty good ghost story instead. Ju-On is good. It's not great, but it's a decent, straightforward ghost story with more than enough scary moments to please most horror fans. Ringu was scarier, but Ju-On is a noble effort. Like most Asian horror stories, it remains ambiguous and open-ended, leaving room for both a sequel and the chance for you to decide for yourself what the curse of The Grudge really is. 7 out of 10 stars.'\n",

            "Review: 'In Japan, when the volunteer social assistant Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) is assigned to visit a family, she is cursed and chased by two revengeful fiends: Kayako, a woman brutally murdered by her husband and her son Toshio. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house is murdered or disappears. \"Ju-on: The Grudge\" is a very scary horror movie, based on a Japanese legend. In the beginning of the film, there is an explanation in this regard. When a person is killed in a violent way, his or her death generates a curse that will stay in the place where the crime took place. If another person visits the haunted place, he or she will be chased by the fiends till death generating another curse. In Western cultures, the fiend is generally trapped in a haunted house, and the person is safe and sound if he or she escapes from the place. This movie impresses because there is no bloody scene, only a tense psychological exploration of the inner fear of human beings for the unknown. The story is very simple and low paced, there are very few special effects, a great use of sound, no gore, but the creepy atmosphere is really frightening. Asiatic cinema proves again that in this moment their cinema is the number one in the horror genre. Unfortunately, the pretentious American industry of cinema insists in remaking and spoiling these Asian masterpieces. I saw \"Ju-on: The Grudge\" for the first time on 02 June 2006. Today, 23 March 2007, I have just watched it for the second time with the intention of seeing the Japanese sequel and I startled many times with this excellent horror movie. I recalled the whole story and now I am familiarized with this Japanese belief of the Ju-on, therefore the non-chronological screenplay got better and better than in the first time that I saw. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Ju-On, O Grito\" (\"Ju-On, The Scream\")'\n",

            "Review: 'Following in the immensely successful footsteps of RING, JU-ON: THE GRUDGE is an influential, creepy and utterly disturbing low-key ghost story from Japan, successful enough to spawn both a sequel and an American remake. This is Japanese horror at its finest: shot on a minuscule budget, utilising real-life 'run down' locations, and with a cast of subtle actors and actresses fleshing out the roles. Director Takashi Shimizu seems to have cast only deeply attractive actresses in his movie, perhaps to keep the attention of his male audience, and this makes the slow-burning proceedings very easy to watch.The 'haunted house' storyline is very straightforward and there isn't much of a plot to speak of: basically, we see a series of interconnected stories showing how a series of characters are haunted. There are a couple of ghosts; one is a cute little boy, whose manifestation mixes fear and pathos; the other is a more traditional female spirit with long, dark hair and staring eyes, the sort who inhabits every Asian horror film since the similar ghost in RING proved so successful. JU-ON: THE GRUDGE dwells on scares and shocks all the way through, which is why it's so effective: it's 100% focused on scaring the viewer. There are many great bits, my favourites including the duvet shocker, the television breakdown, the bloody staircase set-piece at the climax, and the bit with the three dead schoolgirls. There's even time for a twist ending for those who like that sort of thing. For unsettling, deep-rooted frights and genuine creepiness throughout, JU-ON: THE GRUDGE comes up trumps and will be hard to surpass.'\n",

Nothing could top it, right? Well I could not have been more wrong...How totally unprepared was I for what was about to come when I popped Ju-on(original version again), in the DVD-player...Ow my freakin'god, I was so scared through the whole film by the terrifying atmosphere throughout...And how about the sounds...When the ending came i was so scared I could hardly breathe, I had the imprints of my nails in the palms of my hands, and could not speak or move...The aftermath of the movie was me being SO scared I was too chicken to go to the loo...I checked my closets, and my blanket numerous times,and this went on for months... had nightmares too...and was totally afraid of the dark allover again...like when I was a kid or maybe even moreso...I have seen a lot, but this one is definitely the most scary,and I do not think I ever wanna see it again...'\n",

            "Review: 'Regardless its very high ranking on the list of 'Incomprehensibly Overrated Asian Horror Flicks', \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" isn't an entirely bad little film at all and it certainly contains more genuinely spooky moments than any other Japanese horror films released in the last 15 years. The problem, however, is that these spooky moments are merely snapshots and isolated images whereas the film as a wholesome is disappointingly trite and virtually plot less. The synopsis of \"Ju-On\" is actually no more than one phrase: \"a family tragedy occurred in a house one day and the restless spirits of a murdered child and woman still dwell around\", period! The film is divided into EIGHT little chapters, all of them revolving on how a certain person (a social worker, a police officer, a schoolgirl....) comes in touch with the house and its ghostly residents and then...well...DIES! That's all, really. After approximately the third chapter, you've pretty much seen it all and you can start getting annoyed with the total lack of chronology, story-background and logic. What exactly are the intentions of these ghosts? Why can't they find peace? All this is seemly of no importance as long as every chapter ends with a creepy scene of the ghosts scaring another person to death. But it has to be said, it is very creepy!! The little boy-ghost has the eerie habit of appearing everywhere (really EVERYWHERE) just staring at you, whereas the woman-ghost produces the most disgusting but effectively disturbing sounds ever! \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" may not make the slightest bit of sense, but at least it will frighten you a couple of times. It sure is better than all the \"Ringu\"-films, \"Dark Water\" and \"Phone\".'\n",

            "Review: 'A horror classic and for all the right reasons. I am a huge fan of this movie and really appreciate what it does. This is my third time watching it and it only gets better.We follow a group of people all hit by a curse. The curse dose all in it's power to kill anyone who comes into contact with it. It is a pure evil that doesn't discriminate.The movie can have a cheap feel to it with it's effects, makeup and camera work, but I find this inspirering. It can feel a bit student filmish and it's clear the creators used the budget well. The team clearly had to be inventive with everything and it inspires a guy like me that would love to make a movie myself. The movie is still well done and still works amazingly for me.The movie is well shot from a camera perspective and creates some iconic frames and moves. It works more like a fly on the wall instead of the chatecters POV. Showing us things we don't want to see that it would scare us. It does this very effectively. There is some wierd camera moves here and there but overall I find it really well shot.The acting seems good without me having a great knowledge about the Japanese language. The preformances seem good and believable. There is some amazing scream queens in this movie, and the actors that plays the spirits do brilliantly. They stay in charecter and sell the lost spirits really well.The sets are so well done because they look like the everyday world. They don't look produced like the typical American set, and invites you into peoples homes and something familiar to the viewer. It feels like an intrusion on the private and makes you want to check your hallways a second time before going to bed. The sets are also well thought-out, with details you'll notice after a second watch.The evil in this movie is pure. It feels pointless to fight it and that it can't be stopped. You feel as hopeless as the chatecters and having an unstoppable evil is dreadful and depressing. The movie shows us all the affected and how they die and the evil seems unstoppable no matter what. Young or old, it doesn't discriminate, it's just evil.The movie is full of iconic frames and sequences. From the stairs scene towards the end, to the elevator scene, the bed scenes and the wheelchair reveal. All are perfectly made, iconic and scary scenes.The movie is tied well together but could easily also be wieved as an anthology movie. All the different segments are thier own mini-movie that all are well crafted on their own. No segments feels overshadowed and Works all on their own. The overall ties works great too though and towards the end you learn more and more about the curse.Now here is probably the hardest sell about the movie but an aspect I liked. The movie is told out of chronological order and can be hard to follow the first time watching. I had problems following the plot the first time I'll gladly admit. But I appreciate watching it the second time and the third, I could apeiciate the movie even more. The movie really helps you to follow it's narrative though. It tells you early on that it's out of order and eases you through the different chatecters and tells and shows you how they are all connected. Don't be on your phone during this movie, pay attention and you'll have an easier time following the narrative.If you couldn't tell I love this movie. I find it scary, well done and really depressing in it's subject matter. It is an iconic movie for a reason, it dares to do a lot and gets away with it. I would highly recommend it.'\n",

Actually, I'd even say that the remake was more effective in terms of atmosphere. This original has the better story, and the audience isn't slapped in the face with a stupid \"root\" as they are in \"The Grudge\" (although, maybe that is fleshed out in the other \"Ju On\" movies, which I have not seen). The chronology play was interesting and fresh, but this is so important to the director, then there should have been more inclusion of time indicators. After awhile, the movie gets really boring--different people being haunted and attacked by the same ghosts in the same way, over and over again. I realize this is the point of the movie, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining time. My Rating: 6/10.'\n",

Death becomes a part of that place, killing everything it touches. Once it sees you, it never lets go.''This explanation makes our movie starts. First we see Rika, a volunteer social worker charged for an older lady named Tokunaga Sachie. Rika sees Sachie alone in the house, and to make things worst, the house is a complete mess. When Rika is cleaning the house, she starts hearing noises that come from the bedroom closet, and opening the closet, she finds Toshio. Toshio is a young boy that Rika recognizes from a photo she saw in the house. Finding everything very strange, she calls the welfare center to report the incident, and just a little after, she is attacked by a black shadow with two big eyes. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house, is murdered or eventually disappears. Different characters , different moments and different years are shown through the movie.I watched ''Ju-on: The Grudge'' almost three years ago,recommended by a friend who told me the movie was very scary. I watched it and I found it even more scary then I would imagine it to be! I told my father to watch the movie, and he liked as well. I just discovered recently, that this movie is the third from the Japanese Ju-on series. (I am looking forward to watch the other ones.) Definitely the Japanese version of this movie is MUCH better and frightening then the American version, not to mention that is the original version. The atmosphere and music of this movie definitely helps in make you feel even more scary; that's one thing I love in Japanese horror movies: they make you feel frightened without special effects or monsters. It's all psychological and using the imagination of the viewer.This is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen, and for sure made me stay scared for more then just 2 days.Totally recommended for horror movies fans!'\n",

Which is too bad, because they're both great in their own right.On it's own, Ju-on is fantastic.  It boasts itself as a simple contained story without stretching on into some sort of epic.  Where some movies will say: \"We've got a weaved story that's real creepy\", Ju-on seems to say: \"You came to watch a ghost story, and that's what you're getting.  Now sit there as we shove your heart through your butt-hoop.\"Folks, if you have issues with dead stares and good use of dark angles and sound, it's extremely creepy.Studios aren't giving Sam Raimi millions of dollars to re-make this film in Japan alongside its original director for nothing.  If not my word, take their's.  The only reason this film got noticed in the first place is because of its original two-part TV airings in Japan that created such a buzz, they re-shot it for film.-- Or maybe you'll take the advice of people who've watched too many brainless popcorn summer movies and never watch it.  Ju-on's an Excellent flick.'\n",

Even before Rika enters the house she doesn't feel right. The house is a mess, the rest of the family is missing with the woman left alone. Soon Rika finds a boy locked in a room; Toshio. But there is a more malevolent force in this house, that is consuming all how come into contact.Ju-On is an interesting twist on the haunted house genre. With the multi-linear story line, we see how the people who have come into contact with the force surrounding this house have meet their fate. The atmosphere is eerie and foreboding, but its over all not scary. There are moments that your skin crawls; but it doesn't keep it at a constant pace. The multiple story lines does become redundant after awhile. They should have focused more upon only a few people and flesh out their story, instead of adding story line upon story line. They don't even add much information to the overall story.I think the problem i had with this is that i got stuck in the cultural translation. At times the mythology went over my head, not understanding a lot of the significance that the story holds. Janpanese ghost stories are so different from western styles, so it takes awhile to understand the difference between the two. Janpanese ghost stories are more about the mood, while the American ghost stories are more about the scare.Though it went flat during the middle, its still an interesting watch and help change your view on ghost stories.'\n",

            "Review: 'I got this film from a friend who bought it (and its sequel) on holiday in Malaysia.I'm not a horror fan, in fact I pretty much hate horror films because they are never scary, just cheap with gore thrown in to make up for the lack of legitimate scares. Despite this I enjoyed Ringu (and hated the sequel) so I watched this. The story is about a haunted house in Tokyo in where every visitor ends up dead or goes missing at the hands of a creepy white ghost kid and its mother (also a ghost). The appearances of these ghosts stem from a family who lived in the house until the father killed his wife and their child. Now the house is cursed and any one who goes in ends up dead.The story is chapter based much like Pulp Fiction and tells the story of each character who enters the house. This works well for the first 45 minutes of the film. Each character meets a creepy demise and you get a spooky feeling from just watching these characters that appear to be safe nowhere from the two ghosts. Unfortunately the last 45 minutes see the chapters become nothing more than disjointed and confusing. The final chapter is so surreal its ridiculous and makes no sense. To say this film loses its way is an understatement.The story is left open ended and while some may argue that this is to allow the viewer to interpret what has happened I say it is due to the writer and directors inability to wrap up what could have been on of the best ghost stories ever made.In the films defence the ghosts of Toshio and his mother are very unnerving, especially Toshio, considering they are just people painted white. Toshio has these big black eyes and remains silent throughout the film. Put simply he just looks plain weird, appearing from out of nowhere to scare the character out of their wits. Films never scare me but for some reason every time the kid was on the screen I felt cold shivers. The film is probably worth watching for this feeling alone and the first 45 minutes are excellent although ultimately you'll be disappointed with the ending. The sequel is better but strangely loses its way at more or less the same point in the film as the first and ends in much the same manner. It just gives more of an 'ending' that the first film lacks.'\n",

And there have got to be at least thirty phones at the office where I work—twice that amount if you include mobiles—but I've never filled my pants when they've rung (thank heavens!).If, like me, you are not in the least bit perturbed by small, pale boys with black paint around their eyes or a telephone's ring-tone, then don't be surprised if you find Ju-on: The Grudge more than just a little disappointing. Frights are limited to the aforementioned phone-calls and the little lad popping up unexpectedly, plus the occasional appearance of his equally un-scary mother who croaks like a frog whilst crawling very slowly downstairs on her belly.Perhaps, to a Japanese person well versed in the Ju-on legend, all this might seem like seriously scary stuff, but I was bored rigid, with matters made even more irksome by the film's excruciatingly slow pace and a pointless fractured time-line that ensured maximum confusion. Quite what Sam Raimi saw in this to make him want to fund a remake I'll never know...'\n",

I was pretty mad because I thought this was the first movie. Why can't people number their films instead of only adding cliche subtitles? At least the previous films are not very long in duration. Another fact that pisses me off here, is the non-linear plot. Movies should stop trying to be the next pulp-fiction and writers should just stick with chronological order. I mean, there is a girl that visits his brother, he locks her outside because he saw kayako, he dies and then the police find his body. In the next segment we see the girl phone calling her brother and in the beginning I thought this was before her visit to the brother's house but then she is killed by Kayako in her own apartment before visiting her brother. So which scene happened first? I don't understand. Did they forget to edit the film or just tried to make it into an anthology with no connection. I hate moments like that. Next, the characters are pretty bland, I mean they are a lot but the closest one I tend to be interested in is the police officer who investigated the Kayako case formerly but still he hasn't got any interesting dialogue and his encounter with the classgirl vision in the film confused me a lot. His death is also disappointing and also isn't explained. He just appears in a scene with his daughter and just passed away like that. The horror is decent though if you are horror film starter. Kayako and her son are some of the most disturbing characters in horror history and her rattle will haunt you.'\n",

Ringu was a failure because of its complete lack of imagination and its degeneration into an endless, pointless detective story, which meant that when resolution finally came it was all explained away and any impact was totally dissipated. Well they didn't make the same mistakes in Ju-On?well except for the lack of imagination. But along with that, they made an entire no swath of mistakes! A Ju-On is a type of curse, a spirit of vengeance that haunts a place when the spirit has died in the midst of a great rage. Whoever comes into contact with the Ju-On, will be destroyed by it. Thus we have a house, and we have various stories of people who come into contact with the house that contains the Ju-On. This should have been horrifying and freaky and disturbing, but at every turn, they succeeded in diminishing it to nothing. For a starters, we never get to know ANY of the characters, we meet them, and 5 minutes later they are being terrorised by the spirits. They are less than two dimensional characters, and I am not able to just accept dumb bad character writing like most idiot viewers. The key to making your audience feel fear and anxiety is to get them involved in the characters. They get an F for that one. Because of its fragmented style, the narrative is totally about the spirits and the evil they perform. Thus there is no actual plot, which should allow for some great horror sequences and very little boredom. But after you've seen the first 4 incidents, you realise that they are all exactly the same with little to nor variation and thus you sit bored for the rest of the film waiting to see if they do something interesting. The one time they do actually try something different, it makes to little sense and doesn't seem to be from the same film and involves a character who you never ever found out what happened to him, thus making it irritating and very much not interesting. So there is no imagination in the horror sequences, they get an F for that one too. And oh wow, look , it moves back and forth in time? so you don't actually really know what is going on half the time and have to stop and try and figure it all out, which, in a film that is meant to be a continuous driving horror fest, is not a good thing. It adds very little to the film and increases the irritation factor. They are remaking this one for the western world as I type. I believe that this one could actually be improved by Hollywood, as they will enforce certain narrative aspects and imaginative big budget horror sequences, which while not necessarily the best kind of horror, is a hell of a lot better than any of the trash that occurs in this version.'\n",

            "Review: 'This film I actually saw pretty soon after seeing the American remake. I did the same thing with The Ring and Ringu. I will admit though, I didn't really care for this one and it was the out of order timeline that messed with it. That is something I've gotten over as I started to understand the movies in this series. The synopsis here though is a mysterious and vengeful spirit marks and pursues anybody who dares enter the house in which it resides.We start off first learning about what a Ju-on is. Sometimes when someone dies a violent death, a curse is placed on the house that will follow anyone who enters. It then shifts to grainy looking footage. We see Takeo Saeki (Takashi Matsuyama) gnawing on his finger nails. There is blood on him. He grabs a cat violently. We then see him taping a picture back together. When he turns it around, the woman in it doesn't have a face as that part is still missing.The film doesn't follow a straight narrative and will jump around. It is told in six different chapters, each following a different character. The first chapter follows Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina). She is a volunteer at a Social Welfare Center. Hirohashi (Chikara Ishikura) is on the phone when she comes in, but breaks away to speak with her. He asks if she will be willing to go to a house to check on a client. The person that was assigned her took the key and then never came back. She reluctantly agrees, stating that she is just a volunteer.She goes inside to find the place is trashed. There is a window of a bedroom door where she sees something running their fingers over it. It is an elderly woman by the name of Ms. Sachie (Chikako Isomura). She doesn't talk much, but Rika gives her a sponge bath and then gets her to bed. She then cleans the rest of the place up. She makes a call to Hirohashi to tell him no one has come back yet. Hitomi Tokunaga (Misaki Itô) calls asking for her brother, Katsuya (Kanji Tsuda) as well as after their mother. Rika then goes upstairs to finish cleaning. In a bedroom she finds a closet door that is closed and taped shut. She hears a cat meowing and opens it up. There is a cat as well as a little boy locked inside. His name is Toshio (Yuya Ozeki).When she goes back down stairs, she sees Sachie laying down with a dark entity over her. It looks over at her and we see its eyes. The movie then gives us our story over the next 4 chapters, with the final one showing the truth behind everything. They follow Kazumi (Shuri Matsuda) who is married to Katsuya. What happens to his sister of Hitomi. There's a chapter where the police investigating what happened, one being Nakagawa Keiji (Hirokazu Inoue), and reaching out to the detective who was originally working the Saeki case. This detective is Yûji Tôyama (Yoji Tanaka) and the curse also involves his daughter. Her name is Izumi (Misa Uehara). With the final chapter taking the name of Kayako (Takako Fuji), Takeo's wife, and showing how all of this fits together.Now that is where I want to shift over to break down this movie. I've already said a bit about how I got confused the first time that I saw this movie due to the non-linear timeline. I still got confused this time around and I'm pretty sure this is like the 4th time I've seen it. There are some things that are bit fuzzy for me, but I'm going to try to break them down a bit.Something that I noticed for this version, as this is a bigger budget remake of the writer/director Takashi Shimizu's previous take of Ju-on: The Curse. That was more of a TV movie and it felt like that. This version doesn't give us why Takeo kills his wife. We know he went into a rage and wiped his whole family out. I'm not sure if Shimizu assumed that everyone seeing this saw that previous movie and that is the explanation, but I just know it is missing from this movie from what I gathered.Yûji was the detective as I said who was investigating the original crime. There wasn't a lot to look into, but whatever happened messed with him and he retires from the force. Now it appears when he is reached out to by Nakagawa, this is when Rika discovered what happened to Katsuya and Kazumi. This explains why the house is in disarray when she arrives. Where I get confused though is how Rika's friend of Mariko (Kayoko Shibata) could have Toshio as a student since she is a teacher. By the time this goes down, he should have already been dead. Aside from that, I get what they're doing and I think it is an interesting way to present all of this.I feel that this movie is also playing with time travel or at least using time as a flat circle. There is a moment where Yûji is trying to do something to the house and he sees his daughter as Izumi the teen. There's another moment where she sees her father as well in the house later on. This is kind of an interesting thing to play with her since both of them are touched by it and it ruining their lives as well.The last thing before I move to another aspect is that I think the curse is a bit loose here. It does follow some of the people involved, but not everyone. The rules don't seem to be too concrete and really are just picking and choosing for certain set pieces. It is terrifying though that someone could be touched and then haunted for just going into a house like we get here. I do think this series later on plays with some interesting concepts with this idea.Next I want to shift this over to the acting. What is interesting here though is that I don't necessarily know if we have a true lead as so many characters get their spot. Okina was good as this person who really is just wrong place at the wrong time. She has a good look though and I like what happens with her to start and close this film out. Itô has one of the creepiest things to happen to her of anyone. Uehara is solid along with Tsuda, Shibata, Matsuda and the rest of the cast. Shout outs to Ozeki, Fuji and even Matsuyama. The first two really get to do some creepy things and Takeo has a nice bookend in this movie.I'll take this over to the effects next. They really don't have a lot of them in this movie and they do quite a bit with practical. Fuji really helps here with how creepy she is when she is crawling. Ozeki gets props from with as well. I do like the make-up to have them wearing black eyeliner and have their skin really whitened up. There are some others that are done up as well which worked. There is some CGI that really doesn't hold up for me. I do have to point that out. I also really like the cinematography here. They do a really good job at playing with the frame and having things that the characters don't see, but we do. That is something that really makes me uncomfortable.Finally I'll go over the soundtrack and sound design of the movie. The score didn't really stand out, but it fit for what was needed. I did notice it at some of the more tense scenes, which works for me. What really is creepy is the sound that Kayako makes. I've heard that was done with a comb and running something along the teeth. The reason she makes that sound is both sad and wonderful for how it plays out for sure.Now with that said, I wasn't very high on this movie and I've definitely come around to it. It has an interesting way of telling the story that can get a bit confusing, but I think the more viewings, the more it makes sense. I like some of the ideas that they're playing with her. I do think there are some things that are bit off with the story though and some of the rules of this curse. The acting is good. The effects are as well aside from some CGI. The soundtrack is fine where the sound design gets under my skin. The cinematography is also well done. I would rate this as a good movie that is just borderline on an all-time great for me.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10'\n",

            "Review: 'With obvious homages to Ring, The Grudge could be accused of an element of plagiarism. That doesn't, however, detract from the fact it's a pretty decent picture, and one of the better Tartan Asia Extreme movies.First things first - I *love* Ring, and of course, I mean the Japanese original. That film is by far and away the greatest horror flick ever devised and goes above and beyond what I ever expected a movie to do. However, it also instigated a ready conveyor belt of substandard imitators from the same shores ready to cash in on this unique success. Dire nonsense like the hollow Dark Water, the dull and over stylised Eye, the truly pitiful Phone and the slightly bizarre Audition haven't truly come close to the level of Ring.Now, while Grudge isn't quite up there with the very best horror films, as far as these Asian efforts go, it's definitely one of the more effective selections.Megumi Okina is Rika, a volunteer homehelper. On being assigned to a family whose regular assistant is temporarily unavailable, she encounters the mother of the family who seems unresponsive. However, after a disturbing incident at the family home, Rika finds herself seemingly haunted by some kind of entity and everyone who gets involved in the case seems to endure the same trauma.It's a slightly convoluted story to explain, but it works pretty well on screen. As usual the Japanese acting is generally pretty bland, but a few loud screams certainly add colour.The main 'bad guy' seems to be some type of ghostly being, and while it doesn't utterly terrify, it definitely brings a few chills. The only real problem is we see too much of it, and not enough is left to our imagination ala Ring. This takes away a certain air mystery and fear. Moreover, the fact the entity resembles the symbolic Japanese girl with long black hair we've come to expect in the likes of Ring and Dark Water slightly detracts from notions of originality.However, this is redeemed by some pretty effective direction and camera-work, which aid to promote certain wrongness about what is going on.Perhaps a few aspects don't altogether make complete sense, but there's enough style here to paper over such cracks.Movies like this do go to show that when it comes to horror, the Far East have a handle over the Western world.It's by no means the most brilliant horror I've ever seen, but it's definitely not bad and if you're up for a chill or 2, you could do far worse.'\n",

True horror is an overrated/over-hyped Japanese flick in which a naked little boy covered in talcum powder runs around a house and his true moment of terror is when he bulges his eyes and makes a very loud \"Mroooooooooooowwww!!!!!!\" sound effect. Oh my god, it was so scary, I had a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital for a heart transplant.OK let's be serious now. I, like many and their dog, saw this before its American counterpart was released. I was hoping I was going to be in for a good ghost story, when instead I was in for a movie about people being scared by the aforementioned naked talcum powder drenched kid and some girl with bad hair who makes some belching noise to threaten her victims. Who'd have known people were so easily scared?There isn't much of a plot to speak of, except people go in a house and die by these two \"ghosts\". There was one scary part, and that was when the woman got pulled under the sheets, but that was done way better (and not so cheaply) in its American remake. The film's atmosphere sucks too- why is everything so light??? The American remake is an improvement as you can see they achieved the scares the original didn't. Way better creepy/brooding atmosphere, more convincing ghost story, etc. Save your money on this dreck.'\n",

As several people have already reported, the acting is bad, there is no discernible plot, and we never have anything resembling closure. All we see is a man and woman who keep seeing appearances and disappearances of a dead, wet girl and a small naked kid. Whoop-ti-doo! That's it. Oh, and we keep hearing this stupid noise over and over again -- a noise that simply sounds like a person making guttural utterances with their throat. You never get to see what significance this sound has in the film. You never see what makes it or why. After the 20th time hearing it, and still not seeing anything scary accompanying it, you will like just start ignoring it, like I did.Then there is this bizarre \"hair torture\", which I think must be some kind of Japanese cultural thing, because I don't get it at all, even though I've watched lots of Asian cinema. What this hair-torture amounts to is seeing long, black hair, usually messy and unkempt, creeping around corners or stairs, as though the women to whom it belongs is just out of camera range, and we only see the hair. Does the hair act like a snake, and try to choke people? NO! Does it attack people and cut them or whip them? No! All it does it just creep down the stairs, AND NEVER DOES ANY HARM TO PEOPLE. Apparently the Japanese are horrified by dirty, unkempt hair. Whatever.Sure, the atmosphere is occasionally creepy, with earthy ambient sounds and such, but the film itself fails to creep or horrify. In the end, all we have is a disjointed, plot less, conclusion-less collection of scenes, with a naked boy and a dead wet girl. and a couple of people reacting to it all with expressions of fear, and screams. It's not the artsy, avant guard film that fans rave about. It's just a dull mess of a film that has fewer scares than the average Ed Wood film.Horror does not have to be gory. Horror does not have to have blood or gruesome makeup effects. For example, The Blair Witch Project had no gore or makeup, and managed a few good scares. This film only succeeds in being weird and incomprehensible. If unkempt hair and white-skinned wet girls scare you, then knock yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this boring, pretentious trash.'\n",

Sadly, nothing here is scary. I had a really hard time caring and was confused by the disjointed and tangential structure of the film. Sometimes the lack of logic in a horror film can work it's benefit. Not the case here. Seeing this film reminded me of why I hate formulaic slasher films. sure, there are some interesting things here, but nothing really gells.

Wow! If this was the case, then the total number of cursed places, worldwide, would truly be a staggering number. I'd say there'd probably be a cursed residence in just about every single neighbourhood, from here to eternity, and beyond.Anyways- With its story moving along at an absolute snail's pace, The Grudge (and its mega-cheap scares) was pretty awful horror, for the most part. I mean, it wasn't even a slightly interesting ghost story, if you ask me.As it turned out - More than anything else, my main effort while watching The Grudge was to actually stay focused enough in hopes of remaining fully-awake through the blasted thing.'\n",

Not since The Ring (original Japanese version) has any other horror flicks cause so much tension and screams in theatres. The reason it is so much different from American horror films, is that it uses one-of-a-kind sound effects, and the now famous 'slow and silent' tempo that causes the eerie feel to the movie. Most horror movie goers prefer watching big-breasted blondes running around screaming at the top of her lungs, whilst a mad knife weilding man chases her. That's where the ratings fall. Japan has established itself for being the 'land of horror film'. And Ju-on is no exception in living up to the standard. Sam Raimi has remarked this film as scary. From a director of his calibre making such remarks to ASIAN films, you know there's something coming up. The movie is a sequence of short stories, all interrelated. Which makes it good as it keeps audiences trying to figure out what's going on, and at the same time scaring the sh*t out of them. The films starts out slow, and proceeds with the same rythym throughout. I cannot possibly describe the \"scream\" scenes, as it will largely spoil the fun of watching it.

Sitting on my chair watching these two movies, I have the hope that something would come up as a reward. Virtually nothing horrible comes up, and that makes the film 'horrible'.The so-called atmospheric horror in these two films (Grudge 1 and 2) is something like looking at a confined mad person. The evil spirits will kill everyone in contact and the population of evil spirits grow to no ends, and no purposes per se. Worse still, the first 30 minutes of Episode 2 is the EXACT COPY of the last 30 minutes of Episode 1. What is the rationale?

Don't take for granted that 70% of the people who quoted for 10 out of 10 is a good guide. I doubt these people never watched good horror films before.

Anyway, Ju-on didn't exactly meet my expectations, but was a hugely effective thriller, especially given it's financial limitations. Clearly shot on a shoestring budget, Director Takashi Shimizu gets as much as humanly possible out of what was available to spend. The movie plods along slowly and at some points comes off as a loosely connected series of freaky occurrences inside the house in question, but gradually the story comes into clearer perspective.Normally I really enjoy movies that take a while to build up, not that plod along, but that seem to move along at a slow pace and then suddenly you realize there was a lot more going on than you realized. That's the kind of thing that makes you want to watch a movie again. Not because you didn't get it, but because now you know that there has to be something that you missed. Ju-on is kind of like that.I have to admit that I found the pace a little slow at times, but was mostly put off by things like bad make-up and too much of that cheap special effect that's supposed to be scary, where people who are ghosts or zombies or something open their eyes really wide and don't move. On the other hand, I tried to remember the budget limitations, and I really think that the movie was effective for the amount of money that they had to make it.The Ring and Ringu are two of those kind of controversial movies, like The Blair Witch Project, that everyone either loved or hated. I loved all three of them, and was mostly comparing Ju-on to Ringu when I watched it, and I have to say that I liked Ringu better. Those Japanese just know how to make horror movies. The atmosphere in Ju-on was very effective and eerie throughout the movie, but Ringu and The Ring, to me, were just terrifying.Ju-on just didn't have the same depth of plot that Ringu did. It's essentially about a curse that inhabits a house and infects anyone that comes into contact with it. You can't run away, and once it gets you you're haunted by it forever. Like the budget, there's not a lot to work with there, but they turned it into a thriller that is, as they say, more than the sum of its parts.Note: my favorite special effect you couldn't even see, it was that creepy creaking sound that was heard anytime the shadow ghost was on screen.

The story follows a variety of characters that enter this house.The film is structured into a series of short vignettes. We follow different people who encounter the horror of the mysterious house. To be honest, the plot only barely makes any sense. It seems to be no more than really an excuse to string together a number of scary moments. This is excusable on the grounds that this is a genuinely unsettling film. It's unnerving in that way that the best Japanese ghost movies are. The cultural difference between east and west means that these movies come at us in ways we can't predict as easily. The Grudge, like Ring, is no different in this respect and its scare factor stems quite a bit from this unknown quality. There is a constant atmosphere of dread in this one.If it perhaps had a little more coherence it would have the potential to reach the top bracket of horror. As it is, it works as an exercise in inventively scary Japanese horror moments. For me this is a perfectly acceptable compensation, as it's quite rare for any film to scare you in the way that this one sometimes does. So with that in mind, it's quite obvious that this movie has achieved something impressive.'\n",

The first Asian horror movie I ever saw was Ringu, and if I had stopped there I'd have missed nothing at all. It is, of course, too late now that I've seen at least ten of the damned things; but I'm hoping that someone will heed this warning before attempting to see Ringu's many rip-off's, or even that film itself. I actually went into this movie with some hope, as the Asian horror sub-genre's sister; the wave of American remakes, actually produced a decent take on this tale; but alas, it turns out that this is one of the few times that the remake is superior to the original. This film relies more on a creepy atmosphere than a story to deliver it's scares, and this is more than evident on several occasions as the story constantly gets put on the backburner, leaving us with a very muddled plot indeed. After announcing that when someone dies in a fit of rage, their spirit lays dormant; the film skips between various happenings in a rush that is far too swift to keep up with, making it very, very easy to get bored.A major thing I'm not impressed with when it comes to Japanese horror films is the effects on the ghosts. The ones in this movie are no better on the looks front than the norm, but they accompanied by a certain noise that does serve in being quite frightening. It's hardly a masterstroke on the director's part, but at least the film has a good point. The way that the story moves is really confusing. I noticed this with the remake too, but it's even worse here. We start off at one point, and suddenly we find ourselves somewhere else and it doesn't exactly make for an interesting watch when you can't tell what's happening. The film does look nice throughout, but this is a purely aesthetic point, and doesn't help it when it comes to the more important parts. Important parts, like characters, for example; and the ones here are paper thin, and impossible to care about. Much like the entire film.

            "Review: ''Ju-on: The Grudge' for me is the final nail in the coffin for the much hyped new Japanese horror resurgence of the last five years or so. Now there HAVE been some amazing movies coming out of Japan since the 1990s, even as far back as the 1980s, that deserve more than small but enthusiastic cult followings, especially many of those made by film makers like Takashi Miike, Shinya Tsuakamoto and Takashi Ishii. Most of their movies ('Fudoh: The New Generation', 'Tokyo Fist', 'Gonin', 'Ichi The Killer',etc.) are crime or exploitation and not strictly horror, but they are innovative and exciting and shocking and everything the mainstream claims 'Ringu' et al are. Why those movies haven't received half as much attention as 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', 'Ringu 0', 'Dark Water' and 'The Eye' (which isn't actually Japanese but is usually lumped in with the others mentioned) baffles me. The mainstream proclaims 'Ringu' and friends to be the greatest thing to hit horror in years. They are supposedly some the scariest movies you'll ever see and Hollywood is falling over itself to remake them with hot babes in the lead roles. Me, I just don't get it. I've watched hundreds of horror movies over the years, great ones, good ones and plain awful ones, so I think I have some appreciation for the genre, but I just don't see what the appeal of those movies are. Nonsensical story lines, two dimensional characters we don't give a hoot about, and lots of lame scares and second hand imagery (mainly derived from old Argento and David Lynch movies) doesn't exactly spell the future of horror for me I'm afraid. So anyway, 'Ju-on: The Grudge' is dished up to me with a \"no, this one is REALLY REALLY scary!\". I tried to watch it with an open mind, hoping that this time I will be impressed, but no, it's the same old tired bullshit. Ghost kids, schoolgirls with white face paint crawling around making funny noises, blah blah blah. Oh sorry, there were also cats and an old man playing peek-a-boo, I almost forgot. Man, give me a break! Some say that you have to have seen the previous movies in the 'Ju-on' series to really \"get it\", but frankly I don't care. I can't see how any amount of back story can save this jumbled, confusing mess. The bottom line is that it isn't frightening or disturbing it's just BORING and silly. The only grudge I care about is the one I'm going to hold against everybody who told me this was worth watching!'\n",

            "Review: 'I never really enjoyed 'Ringu'. Two years worth of hype ruined it for me (it was either the hype, or the fact that is was a glorified detective mystery). Having only heard a a couple of negative reviews for the American version of 'The Grudge', I got to watch 'Ju-on: The Grudge' without any expectations, and I was quite impressed.'Ju-on' follows a story about a haunted house. After a violent murder took place at the house, a curse was born. All who enter the house are cursed by the Grudge, a curse from which there is no escape. Unlike the plot-heavy 'Ringu', 'Ju-on' is fairly light on plot. The story is broken up into chapters that seem to jump backwards and forwards through time. I thought this was an excellent way to tell the story and maintain suspense without revealing too much.Having seen not seen any good psychological horror movies recently, while watching stuff like 'Versus' and some of the Jason movies, it was a nice change of pace to watch a good suspenseful horror. 'Ju-on' defies some rather dubious production values, creating a creepy atmosphere and providing scares for any fan of intelligent horror movies.I enjoyed 'Ju-on: The Grudge'. I'm hoping I can get my hands on the original Japanese version sometime, and avoid certain disappointment by watching the American remake. I recommend this to any fan of horror movies, providing they can be patient with obvious cultural differences in story-telling, just don't watch it with anyone who is prone to talking during a movie - 9/10Final note: This may be the only time I have not used the word awesome in a review.

However, I was really pleased by Ju-On.You won't be scared to death, nor scream your lungs out after the scary scenes, but you will feel very... uncomfortable.As an east Asian, the cultural proximity could have helped me to be more immersed in the Japanese style horror stories. Yet, I think it is the design of the ghosts that made me feel very uncomfortable.Some may say there's nothing scary to see humans painted in white with a bad hair day, but ... they are scary.Especially when you saw real ghosts in your life.

It's not quite as effective as Ringu, Dark water or The Eye but what Ju-on lacks in editing and direction it makes up for in sheer unrelenting terror. It has some of the most horrific moments in cinematic history. Under the blanket, the shower, under the table, waking up, etc.  The moments sometimes don't amount to all that much and it's somewhat confusing but film creates an atmosphere of extreme dread supported by decent performances and a chill inducing score.  Compared to the others I realize it may seem a litlle amateurish but a little fine tuning never hurt anything. And they're currently preparing for american remake so you never know what the results may be. they certainly did an admirable job with The Ring.  The story focuses on a group of charachters as theyc ome in contact with Ju-on the prescence left over by a truly horrible act that occured. It than transforms into a curse and continues and gets worse with each person it comes in contact with. I'm not sure it truly makes that much sense but does it really matter.

It's possibly also the lamest, least original horror to yet emerge from the Japanese New Wave. If The Eye and Dark Water were two of the most buttock-yawning supernatural-shockers to ever crawl out of South East Asia, this rubbishy cash-in wouldn't qualify for a Rod Serling Night Gallery episode. The Grudge  it might as well have been called 'The Strop', or 'The Sulk', for all its impact  is the curse, created by a murdered mother and child, that kills those who enter their family home. Unfortunately, while the pacing and tension's completely kaput, the ghouls themselves are just laughably crap. These include Three Little Zombie Maids from School (in blue face-paint) and a saucer-eyed boy who 'meows' his victims to death. He also turns up in the most embarrassing places: in a victim's bed, emerging from another's blouse  or under restaurant tables (a scenario that gets middle-class parents bad reps, and on fellow diners nerves in parts of Islington). Someone should explain to Takashi that little boys really aren't very scary. Little girls, of course, are absolutely terrifying. That's why Stanley Kubrick used two of them in The Shining. For her part, Catboy's mother  a keening long-hair half-inched from 'Ringu', looks like nothing so much as Kate Bush in her Babooshka period, and makes similar noises.'\n",

They start screaming and clutching on to their face like they are dying when they've only heard a strange noise. The only thing that was scarier about this movie was Toshio. He was creepy in this one and kind of dull in the remake. The dead woman was lame looking in this one. The lead character was not as eye-friendly as her friends or her American remake portrayer Sarah Michelle Gellar, yet that's what sets this movie apart: an unattractive female lead.

I thought so right up until 2023, where I stumbled upon \"Ju-On: The Curse\" and \"Ju-On: The Curse 2\" both from 2000.However, this 2002 movie is a massive improvement of the previous two movies, though it is essentially just a remake of the original \"Ju-On: The Curse\" movie, except with a much bigger budget, better effects, better production, better acting, and so forth.And while the 2002 movie \"Ju-On\" definitely is a step upwards from the two 2000 movies, then it is a shame that it was essentially just a remake of the original movie.The narrative in \"Ju-On\" is pretty straightforward and easy to follow, making it a rather easy movie to sit down and watch. And if you enjoy the archetypical Japanese style of haunted movies, then \"Ju-On\" should definitely be something right up your alley. Personally, I must admit that a boy with a bad haircut and painted all white and making cat sounds isn't really scary. In fact, it was rather laughly and far from being scary. The mother's creaking sound was actually the most disturbing thing about the movie.As much as I enjoy Asian horror, then I have to say that \"Ju-On\" isn't an outstanding movie. It is certaily a watchable movie, yes. And yes, it is a far better movie that the atrocious American cash-in remakes.Visually then \"Ju-On\" is an adequate enough movie.My rating of writer and director Takashi Shimizu's 2002 movie lands on a five out of ten stars.'\n",

I'm not sure if it was because I'd already seen a version of the story or because I was ready to be scared but this time was was no where near as scared, it still provided a few hair raising moments though.The story opens with Rika, a young social worker being sent to a home where she finds an old woman, upon hearing a noise she looks upstairs and finds a cat in the cupboard as well as a small boy who she didn't notice at first, he says his name is Toshio. Before she can ask him anything else she hears a noise in the old woman's room and finds a strange shadow by the woman, it turns and looks at her leaving her terrified. What follows are a series of incidents each linked to the house some take place before Rika's story and others years afterwards, it appears that everybody who visits they finds themselves haunted by Toshio and the strange shadow and end up dead or missing.The episodic nature of the film seemed strange at first but there were subtle links between them such as mentioning the finding of Rika's body in one of the later chapters. Unlike a lot of horror films there is no gore and we don't actually see the victims die, the chills come from creating genuinely creepy situations, Toshio is particularly creepy even though he doesn't do anything more frightening than stare.'\n",

The second TV movie continued the story but was somewhat less than what came before.This is the first of two big screen adaptation, or should I say continuations of the TV films. You do not have to have seen the TV films to appreciate this since the film is fine on its own (although the Grudge of the title is explained there).The story of what was spawned when a family imploded violently is frightening to watch. Taken on its own its a scary film with jumps and starts and images that will remain with you long after the film has ended. This is a slowly traveling evil that moves from family to family and person to person killing or driving mad all who come in contact with it.It should be said that this is not your typical \"American\" horror film. There are no central characters outside of the house and the ghosts, characters are on stage because they simply become one more link in the line of evil.

The biggest factor for this one is mainly from the scares, which are prevalent throughout here as it works through several impressive elements. As is usual for the Asian ghost genre, the majority of that comes from the quite creepy and definitely scary ghost popping up whenever you least expect it in areas that are quite shocking to see it come from, definitely giving this one a feeling of dread and terror that very few actually manage to accomplish at all yet this is utterly masterful at. There's moments within this one that are all about extreme jump-scares as the ghost appears long before actually interacting with the victim which sets off the scares quite well so scenes of the lone girl in the apartment being tormented by the ghostly doppelgangers of her friends, the showing of the brother and his wife who succumb to the curse and the reporter in the hotel room are all outstanding sequences that work very well because of where the ghost finally pops up and how creepy it is seeing this. When it decides to backtrack and focus more on the suspense of the slowly-approach ghost just utterly terrifying the victims, like the ambush on the security guard at her workplace, the first scenes showing her caring for the grandmother amid the ghost-boy and cat as well as the police detectives in the house during the crime scenes and finally the true meaning of the curse at the end where the hand-trick all-throughout the film finally gets explained, generates some rather creepy moments from time-to-time which causes this to definitely be worthy of its stellar reputation. There's also the generally demented ghostly-look for them throughout here, which is just unnervingly chilling and creepy that serves this one quite well. Unfortunately, it's also slightly problematic as there's a small-but-noticeable flaw here. The only real issue is that the film is plagued by a plot that's far too disjointed to make any sense as we constantly zip around to view the dozen or so different stories that are told within, making it nearly impossible to keep track of who's-who here and what time period we're in since this doesn't go chronologically with that either, and then because we learn so late in the film what's actually going on, it's far too late to really care. When it sticks to the ghosts, it's great stuff all around and is certainly highly enjoyable.Rated R: Violence, Language and themes of child abuse and violence.'\n",

Their stilted movement was excellent and the reliance of white for skin colour and piercing eyes most effective.

A good horror movie not only relies on shock tactics but also on the build-up of tension. This movie sorely lacks both, making it blander than anything. The plot goes nowhere, the characters are just there to be killed off, and the horror scenes aren't really horror. The only thing that separates this from the average slasher flick is in place of a slasher, we get a long-haired ghoul who prefers to crawl instead of walk a la The Ring.Don't get me wrong, The Ring is a superb horror movie. It is just that Ju On uses all the old, tired tricks in the book that it is impossible to get scared anymore. This 'horror' movie puts Japanese horror movies to shame.

And the fact it's Japanese makes it bad too i guess.The story is stupid, the 'special effects' are like some kid from kinder-garden made them.I hated 'The Ring' too - both US and Japanese versions, so i guess i won't see a US version of this one.Was i scared? Scared of what exactly? When 'the scene' happened the music turned up was few seconds later when we already saw 'the scene', which makes this movie just another cheap trash.I expected it to be at least scary, but not even that happened.One of the worst and most stupid movies i've ever seen. Not scary at all, more pathetic i'd say.1/10.'\n",

            "Review: 'A Japanese horror film part of an ongoing series. A mysterious and vengeful spirit marks and pursues anybody who dares enter the house in which it resides.I cannot believe I've never seen this film until now, seeing as Asian horror is my thing! I haven't seen the two shorter films before this one, but it didn't feel like it was necessary anyway. I followed the story throughout, even with its non-linear storytelling. I love ghost story films and I really enjoyed this film! It's atmosphere was perfectly done and it was definitely giving me shivers down my spine at parts. It didn't need jumpscares, it had tension.The multiple story lines made the film so interesting! If it was just one character experiencing these terrifying hauntings happening it wouldn't of flowed so well. It felt really fast, which is good because too much tension can grow to be boring. The acting was all really well done as well! In the American remake (I know, we don't talk about it but I will anyway) it just didn't flow as well. The fact that it was Americanized with it's casting ruined it from the start, but this felt authentic. So I won't be checking out any of the American sequels, seeing as the original remake was lackluster.I also have no real drive to watch the sequels to this film, though I may watch them just out of curiosity if it's just the same story over and over again.'\n",

            "Review: 'Yes, I agree much of this Japanese film about a family murder that took place in a suburban house in Tokyo has merit. It is decidedly stylish. Effectively creepy. Ubiquitously eerie. The acting is uniformly workmanlike and the actors(no pretenses here that I am familiar with any of them)do justice to the desires of the film and its director. That being said, I found the film to be very awkward in many paces. Lacking cohesion. Split-purposed and personalitied. The haunting history behind the house is nothing unique. You have seen it before many times. There is no real resolution to anything either. There are scenes that jump out at you. Some of them mask the real film and make it seem better than it really is - in effect this film about a string of episodic stories dealing with various people that come in contact with the house is a collection of very well-filmed creepy scenes with a pretty poor story at the core. I am surprised it spawned an American remake(well, I guess I'm not truly surprised) as well as sequels to boot. There were so many questions I had left unanswered that I just cannot find myself into lavishing more praise than that which I have given it. Ju-on is really quite derivative when it comes to it source material but saved to some extent by the style and manner in which it is executed. That being said I do not wish to see it again any time soon.'\n",

A family is brutally murdered by the father before he whacks himself after he's finished with his wife, son and the family cat. The movie follows several characters through out a ten year period. People come and go but the angry entity that resides in the house still remains. The negative entity is still restless as it has claimed scores of lives and ruin families. Despite the presence of the mother and her blue child and cat, the real evil spirit is Pop. Yes, Pop's one crazy guy who has the grudge on humanity. The kid and cat appear as a warning whilst the mother is just sad that her life has ended so tragically, she morns over the soon to be victims because they'll end up just like her. The monster that every one fears is Daddy.This movie was huge in it's native Japan. It started off as a made for video movie. The success of the video movie spun off into three theatrical releases and an American remake. I like the original as well as the remake. I have seen Ju-On several times and each time I see something new (i.e. images in reflections and mirrors). If you enjoyed the remake, you'll love the original.Highly recommended!'\n",

            "Review: 'Despite being a big horror fan, I have only recently got around to watching my first Japanese horror film. Ju-On comes with a big reputation, but if this movie is typical of Japanese horror, then I feel I won't be watching too many more.The film is split into five separate segments, each telling a separate part of the timeline of a haunted house. For some reason they are not shown chronologically. I can see no reason for this, other than to confuse the viewer and cover up the lack of any kind of interesting story.The talcum powder covered little boy reminds me of the kind of frights you get in a fairground fun house. The first time he appears it's pretty creepy. After that you're expecting him and he rarely fails to appear at the obvious moments. Each segment seems to end in much the same way, and although the first time we see a figure creeping down the stairs is a little freaky, by the third or fourth time you're really wondering why the characters don't just walk the two feet to the front door. Yes some people may be paralysed by fear, but most would just hot foot it out of there.There are a couple of decent frights in here that have been mentioned before by others, but overall it reminded me of our Paranormal Activity. The film is well shot and evenly paced, but most of the scares are telegraphed and then repeated. The only reason I haven't given this a lower score is that I'm aware this film has been made for a Japanese audience. Ju-On is a well known \"ghost story\" in Japanese culture, and therefore perhaps a significant something is lost on me, both as a Western audience and as someone unfamiliar to Japanese horror'\n",

            "Review: 'After the worldwide success of Hideo Nakata's \"Ringu\" in 1998, the world turned its eyes to Asia's new wave of horror films, discovering an enormous source of new and interesting scary tales. Among the best of the bunch are Takashi Shimizu's ghost stories named \"Ju-on\", a new variation on a classic Japanese ghost story that started as a modest school project that became successful in the direct-to-video market of Japan. As the first two \"Ju-on\" movies became a popular phenomenon among fans, Shimizu gained enough attention to be able to make the third as a proper theatrical feature film. \"Ju-on: The Grudge\" was the name of the third film in this series and the film that made Shimizu's name famous, as soon he was hired to direct a remake in the U.S.At its core, \"Ju-on: The Grudge\", is a series of short stories all related to a mysterious supernatural presence that inhabits a typical Japanese suburban house. Through the years, we follow those who dare to enter the house, and as they find the horrors of the haunting we discover the origins of this deadly curse that seems to have no end. Social worker Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) is our main character (as most of the stories are connected to her), as with her visit to the house she unleashes a new series of supernatural phenomena.Shimizu's ghost story is an excellent retelling of the classic haunted house tale, spiced up with countless details from Japanese folklore, mainly the concept of the Onryo, the vengeful spirit. With a carefully developed script that keeps a nice mix of horror, mystery and suspense (by interconnecting the stories in a very good way), Shimizu delivers a rejuvenation of the typical ghost story for the new millennium's audience. While it is the third part of the \"Ju-on\" series, \"The Grudge\" is easy to follow, and it's probably more enjoyable without the information that the previous two parts give.While the story is probably not very original, the film's main strength is in the very atmospheric tone it has from beginning to end. The minimalist setting and the very artistic portrayal of the haunting (obviously inspired on Kabuki theater), give the film a feeling of dread that becomes more unsettling than the many scares the film has to offer. This is probably what makes the difference between \"The Grudge\" and the many other Asian ghost stories, as the constant creepy atmosphere makes up for lack of graphic images. With few pretensions and a nice taste for horror Shimizu creates one of the best films from the new wave of Asian horror cinema.The cast is mostly effective, and very believable in their roles, despite some playing nothing more than common Japanese stereotypes. Singer and actress Megumi Okina carries the film well as one (if not the most) of the important characters of the film. Yoji Tanaka plays former detective Yûji Toyama (another of the \"main characters\") and delivers an excellent performance (probably the best of the film), as well as Misa Uehara, who plays her daughter Izumi. Is worth to mention that dancer Takako Fuji delivers a terrific performance as one of the manifestations of the house, while not a demanding role in terms of classic acting, her talent as dancer is essential for the haunting image her character creates.While \"Ju-on\" ranks as one of the best Asian horror films of the early century, it doesn't lack flaws. Critics have pointed out that the stories get a bit repetitive after a while and sadly I must agree with them, as the lack of variety (due mainly to budgetary constrains) together with the slow pace may make the film boring for some. Also, as written above, some of the supporting characters are two-dimensional characters that seems to serve no other purpose than to make the plot move. Despite this flaws, \"Ju-on\" is a remarkable horror movie that certainly offers a different look to old folkloric tales of ghosts and haunted houses.Takashi Shimizu has created an interesting modern look for a story as old as mankind, and while it's definitely not a perfect film, it certainly offers a creepy atmosphere for a dark night alone. This very effective horror film is yet another proof that Asian horror is here to stay. 7/10'\n",

Ju-on is a decent horror that at certain moments can be unsettling, but fails to craft a coherent story nor thorough scares at the end.As a horror goes time has moved on a lot and to call this scary is quite the leap. It's mostly pale people and opening their eyes to make a scary face. It never really did anything for me, but I also take in account that the scares are very similar to what is done in the American version. I found the story a bit harder to follow in this, as it jumps around a lot, the gist of it is easy but the reasoning and stuff stays vague.Not much else to say, good sound design though. Decent acting. It's classic, but it's also noticeably aged a bit.'\n",

Police arrive she come through and It's revealed the house is haunted after a man killed his wife and son their spirits now haunt the house and pray upon any who enter it. I feel the best way to describe this movie would be a cult classic to foreigners. This is no way a bad movie but I think more people out of Japan would be more familiar with the 2005 American remake. The movie does start off on a good note and does manage to set the tone with it's atmosphere, However it feels as though it drifts away far from what was going on. It's impressive what they were able to accomplish with the budget they were given. Though quite a few of the actors don't really really put their all into it some of lines. It feels hokey and some parts. It also doesn't help that there's really no real lead in this movie.it seems like it's about Rika but then we're cut to the family that lives in the house and then the cops and then two other people. It gets to the point it becomes confusingly bit. You're focusing on too many people It's really a bunch of segments out of order of various people affected by the curse and after viewing it you can sort of put together the pieces of where they're supposed to take place but in some place it's messy. Some don't add up There's one scene where the cops go to talk to a retire investigator of one of the previous cases. He's not suspiciously answer them he wishes to be left alone. Then literally the next scene jump forward some years, he's trying to burn the house down and the cops are there for no reason. But despite those negatives there are some good things in the movie of the spirits Kayako and Toshio are given quite creepy moments in here such as a security camera and the elevator. The chalk white skin make them stand out.of course that disturbing death rattle stick with you. What also helps build suspense is that the music's really good eerie and creepy. Overall atmosphere in this movie is very good however with it's basic characters, it's very nonlinear story does have you lose interest after a while. If you can get sit down and get through it and make sense of it then you would actually enjoy it for what it is if you're not into those movies that don't really have a straight beginning middle and end you're gonna have some trouble watching this.'\n",

Not long after arriving at the house, however, she starts to hear strange noises coming from inside a taped-up closet from one of the bedrooms and after investigating, she sees a young boy behind the door. She calls her boss for help, but it's here that she witnesses the spirit of a young woman above the elderly lady, causing her to faint. Shortly after, her boss, Hirohashi, arrives at the house, sees what has happened and calls the police. This leads to an investigation into what happened to the prior house tenants, but with more people starting to disappear, it starts to appear that a more sinister force is at work.Ju-on is one of the more commonly heard of - and probably seen - Japanese horrors, and it is not hard to see why as it's a good suspenseful film. Ringu is another well known horror and it can be a toss up between Ringu or Ju-on on which one is better. For me, Ringu is the better, but that's not to say Ju-on isn't just as good at times.As with a lot of Japanese horrors of this genre, Ju-on relies on creating tension & atmosphere to scare the audience rather than over-the-top violence & blood, and it succeeds as it is genuinely creepy in parts. It's also a practical effects and not a CGI film even though there are a couple of CGI uses, but these are brief and add to the overall feel of scenes they are used in.You also have to pay close attention to the story because Ju-on doesn't follow the traditional linear story line. It's 4 or 5 sub-plots that actually cross over and intermingle with each other to make up the main story. Like Pulp Fiction actually, so if you don't pay attention then you will very easily get lost. Some of the acting is a bit dodgy at times, but it's not enough to distract you from enjoying the film.If you're a fan of \"J-horror\" then Ju-on definitely has to be on your list of films to see.'\n",

            "Review: 'By now, most audiences will be fairly familiar with the Japanese series of films known as Ju On: The Grudge; the phenomenally successful saga that began with the straight to video projects Ju On: The Curse, parts 1 and 2 - in which jealousy and adultery in a quaint Japanese suburb leads to an awful murder that marks the house for anyone who subsequently enters it - right the way through to the larger-budgeted Hollywood remake of the film in question and it's equally glossy sequel. Subsequent films following on from The Curse have taken the initial murder as their starting point and created around it a film of loosely connected horror vignettes; mostly in which a series of hapless characters end up in the film's iconic haunted house and then find themselves marked for death by the two most prominent apparitions of the story.If you have already seen the American re-make of The Grudge with Sarah Michelle Geller then there's a good chance that this Japanese original will come as something of shock. Unlike its US counterpart, this grudge features no real central character and has no real plot development (at least, not in the traditional sense). I personally don't see this as a bad thing, as it allows director Takashi Shimizu to concentrate on crafting a number of scenes of gripping high tension - as the collection of disparate innocents who unknowingly come into contact with the infamous house must come to turns with the unexplainable horror that is happening all around them - but obviously, viewers who look for things like narrative closure, explanations of plot developments and something approaching a hero that they can root for might be sorely disappointed.As I mentioned above, this version of The Grudge instead strings together a series of inter-woven scenes that establish the significance of the curse whist setting up a number of fantastic, edge-of-your seat moments of haunted house horror. This isn't a gritty gore-fest with annoying, smug, ultra-cynical characters (as seems to be the trend with much contemporary horror - think Wolf Creek, Hostel, Cabin Fever, The Hills Have Eyes remake and 28 Weeks Later) but rather, the kind of horror that should appeal to anyone who has had to walk home late at night through an empty park and felt the presence of someone (or something) following closely behind. Your heart starts racing as you quicken your step and become convinced that you can hear footsteps rapidly approaching from the left of your shoulder! When you finally pick up the courage to turn around and look, you realise your mind has been playing tricks on you, but the thrill was still heart-stopping regardless.I prefer this kind of horror, which is why I'm such a huge fan of the horror films coming out of Japan, China and North Korea; great works like The Eye trilogy, Wishing Stairs, Abnormal Beauty, Premonition, Infection, Chaos, A Tale of Two Sisters and Takashi Shimizu's own Grudge-follow up Reincarnation. It's slow moving and slow building, almost ambient even; often coming at you from the rear speakers rather than full and on in your face, which for me, really creates a great, eerie atmosphere that works perfectly if you're watching it at 1:30 AM and have to pause for a toilet break and to let the dog out to stretch her legs.Unlike a lot of his American contemporaries, Takashi Shimizu realises that horror isn't about what you see, but what you don't see, and with this in mind he saves any prolonged glimpses of our ghostly antagonists until right towards the very end. He also manages to create a wonderful feeling of isolation, alienation and hopeless emptiness; not only from the haunted house so central to the story, but even in the brightly-lit suburban streets, schools, office blocks and apartment buildings that our characters inhabit. The film is also shot very simply and traditionally, with none of the hyper-cutting and frantic camera movements of western horror, which again, gives the Grudge a more believable and authentic feeling that only heightens the senses of horror and tension. This is also helped by the wonderful performances of the cast who manage to ably convey the right sense of fraught emotion without descending into screaming histrionics.For me, The Grudge is great horror. I'm not even going to call it great Japanese horror because it goes even beyond that. This is horror for those who want chills rather than spills, and those who like to invest some serious time in something that is slower, more deliberate and more dramatic than the usual stalk and slash type stuff (not that I don't love that kind of horror as well, but it's nice to have an intelligent alternative). As mentioned previously, there will be some viewers who won't want to invest their time in such a film that has no obvious sense of narrative and no single identifiable character, but at the end of the day, that's their decision. But they're clearly missing out!'\n",

            "Review: 'Despite its small budget, the film has had a significant impact on horror cinema, both in Japan and globally. The movie revolves around a haunted house, and the ghosts seeking revenge on their killers.The film showcases impressive production and direction that helps it to craft a genuinely spooky atmosphere. Shimizu's use of minimalistic music and subtle camera work leads to an ambiance that sends shivers down the viewer's spine, even without excessive gore. Additionally, the cast delivers an exceptional performance, which helps in intensifying the suspense and horror effects.The scares in Ju-on: The Grudge are one of the film's most significant highlights. The movie employs a series of jump scares, disturbing imagery, and effective psychological effects that instill a sense of sheer terror in the viewer. While the themes and scares might be typical of most horror movies, the true-to-life portrayals of the supernatural aspects of the film make it a worthwhile horror movie.Despite its strengths, the film unfortunately, falls into several horror movie tropes. The story revolves around supernatural tropes such as a haunted house, vengeful spirits, and an ominous child, which adds a predictable and somewhat formulaic feeling to the film. The scattered storytelling structure adds confusion, and not necessarily in a good way.All in all, Ju-on: The Grudge is a spooky addition to the horror genre. The impressive impact of the low budget in the movie is commendable, as are the genuine scares that it elicits.'\n",

            "Review: 'As the film explains, \"It is said in Japan that when someone dies in extreme sorrow or rage, the emotion remains and can leave a stain upon that place. Death becomes a part of that place, killing everything it touches. Once it sees you, it never lets go.\" Ju-On aka The Grudge (2002) portrays a tale of this legend in which a house inhabited by a vengeful spirit haunts then murders anyone who dares cross its threshold.It's a simple story. Ghosts haunt the house in which they died. Doesn't get much more basic than that in a ghost story. However, what Takashi Shimizu did with Ju-On took this very simple story and turned it into a creatively structured and very, very creepy little haunted house horror. At first, the story structure seems rather confusing and awkward, but as the film goes on it becomes much easier to decipher and the complexity of the episode-like structure only adds to the strange and haunting story. Also, the portrayal of the ghosts Kayako and Toshio is extremely creepy, Kayako with her unearthly jerky movements and Toshio with his haunting sadness. I think the best element of this was the lack of false scares: no build-up music that bursts out when we're \"supposed\" to be afraid, no good guys jumping around corners pretending to be a bad guy, etc. Even though most of the sights of the spirits are brief and many will go by unnoticed, those that are spotted are very effective and very stirring. This is something that strays from the typical standard we're used to in which every scare has to be spoonfed to us with some kind of other effect to go along with it. This natural creepiness the film offers really makes this better than the majority of other similar recent films and solidifies it as one of the very effective haunted horrors of the noughties.Final Verdict: 7.5/10-AP3-'\n",

The film sees a women and her son being brutally murdered by the husband, this made the house haunted by a powerful rage where whoever enters inside will be killed the Ghosts of the family. The film has several stories about each of the characters that all connect to the house, as the stories unravel the plot starts to make a little more sense of what's going on since each characters story is at a different time-line.Ju-On: The Grudge can be a little slow paced at times but the creepy and scary scenes of the movie make up for that. Check this out. 10/10'\n",

Never again will I watch a Japanese horror movie alone.This film was both creative and fascinating. It was a great look in Japanese folklore. Comparing this movie to the American version, this one was more scarier and was done better. The American version was more into the effects and the shock factor. This original focused more on the scare factor, the kind that lasts more than a second.With the intertwining of stories and how they overlap makes it s movie you have to think about. The end result left me satisfied yet wanting to know more. I wanted to see more scares and more chills. There was a lot of explaining to do and since I don't speak Japanese, I had to read a lot.Although I found a lot of similarities to The Ring and Ringu, with the long hair of the girl draped over her face and the house being cursed like the video, there are a lot of good qualities that make this movie enjoyable to the horror movie fan.'\n",

There are many such nice bits here: the videotape sequence, the woman who climbs down the stairs, the scene in the shower, the scene under the restaurant table. (And some that don't work -- a scene with many black cats came across as just silly.) The \"problem\" is that there's not much by way of story to hang any of these images on. The storyline's chopped up, much of the logic behind the hauntings is unexplained, at least to these Western eyes (are the boy and the mother the agents of the evil? Or just avatars? What exactly can and can't they do? Why are they killing people who have done nothing to them? Why is nobody really doing anything substantial to fix the problem? etc.) As a result it's hard to get involved in anything here, except in a fairly abstract, \"hey, that's a creepy moment\" kind of manner. Not bad, exactly -- this is my first taste of modern Japanese horror and apparently this sort of surrealistic structure is typical? -- but not something to go out of your way for, either. Maybe rent it, just to experience the imagery.'\n",

Not since the first Paranormal Activity have I experienced those things after watching a horror movie, and I must've seen over a hundred of them since then.I was even prepared for Ju-On: The Grudge as I'd seen the American one a few years ago (a watchable 6/10) and was familiar with screenshots of some of Ju-On's most iconic scenes. Still I was genuinely affected! Watching in real-time, and appreciating the atmospheric build-up and execution of those scenes, really got my almost-dormant scare-genes buzzing. Several times I got those scare-chill feels...left me feeling almost high :DI also appreciated the trippy non-linear way the story was told: it does get quite confusing and the lack of a consistent main character can feel like there's an anchor missing - and especially the ending I'm still not quite sure what exactly happened (or what the peeking-through-fingers represented) - yet I still feel satisfied. I feel compelled to seek out discussion of the film, and certainly to rewatch it at some point.Ju-On: The Grudge has instantly become one of my favourite films, scoring a rare 9/10. It ranks alongside the likes of Paranormal Activity 1, REC 1&2, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Us and The Taking of Deborah Logan among my highest-rated Horrors. It hugely outranks any other Asian Horror, which was becoming an overrated genre in my book: previously I enjoyed Noroi: The Curse the most (7/10) and thought other cult flicks like Pulse/Kairo, Tomie, The Ring, Tale of Two Sisters, Shutter, Dark Water were ok-to-good but ultimately underwhelming.What Ju-On does so much better is pacing: the first chills are already ocurring within 30 minutes, and it always feels like something significant is happening. With a lot of Asian Horror it feels like we're just watching characters move & talk really slowly until finally in the last 30 minutes stuff happens. Ju-On's sound-design is also excellent. And its use of the now-cliché 'scary-japanese-girl-with-long-black-hair' is much more effective than the others.Highly-recommended! Want to check out the rest of the japanese Ju-On series now.'\n",

            "Review: 'Sometimes remakes CAN improve on the original. The American Grudge was a sensationally scary movie {well,just check out my review} which was somewhat confused in it's plotting but skillfully maintained a creepy atmosphere and delivered a chill or a jump every five minutes or so. However,it must be said that some found it just funny {but didn't Alfred Hitchcock say that audiences sometimes laughed when they were nervous?}Coming to the original Japanese version of The Grudge {well,I'll call it Ju-on to separate it from the remake}after having seen the remake is an interesting experience. The plot is,at least for the first two thirds,almost the same and many of the scares are the same too. The ghost in the bed,check. The ghost on camera,check. The ghost in the attic,check. The boy in the lift,check. Maybe this is one reason why Ju-on does not seem as scary as The Grudge,because you know what's coming. Of course this may only be true if one sees The Grudge first,it's quite possible that that Ju-on will seem scarier if that's the version you saw first.However,it seems that director Shimizu Takashi did use the remake to improve on the original in some ways. Although there are a few effective scenes that he did not re-use in The Grudge,such as a bit involving zombie-like schoolgirls,the plot does become very muddled in Ju-on. In Ju-on,there are almost TOO many scare scenes,they lose their impact after a while. Although in my review for The Grudge I moaned about the confusing plotting, quite a bit was actually tidied up from Ju-on. With more characters who enter the possessed house and more shifting around in time,Ju-on becomes somewhat repetitive. The climax of the remake is more exciting,and some effectively nasty things images were added {atleast,to the uncut version}.Ju-on is certainly another solid example of the recent wave of Japanese horror films,with a very uncanny atmosphere and a refreshing and still very effective simplicity to some of the scares,such as just showing a boy ghost now and again,it's enough to send shivers down your spine. However,if you've seen the remake,than Ju-on will not seem nearly as frightening. Than again,maybe it's just down to which version you see first {I saw Ringu before The Ring and to me the remake was not nearly as scary}.'\n",

After seeing the feature length movie myself (with the same friend), I have to say that although there are some creepy moments along the way, the movie doesn't entirely make a whole lot of sense.  In particular, there is one scene where a father runs into his daughter when she's much older than the last time we saw her.  My Japanese friend explained to me that he was dead at this point, but only moments later he falls to the bottom of the stairs after witnessing something horrifying, and 2 others are at the bottom of the stairs to help him with his ordeal.  So was he alive or dead at this point?  Who knows, but both of us (even my native Japanese friend) were scratching our heads after this scene.  Overall it's not a great movie, but it's worth a look if you enjoy asian cinema and the horror genre in particular. Just don't expect too much.Rating:  6/10   some creepy moments'\n",

However, the Grudge and Ju-on should not necessarily be confused, because Ju-on is in fact an entirely different film.I have personally studied Yokai (Japanese Spirits and Monsters in lore) and so far, I haven't heard of any type of haunting spirit quite like the ones in the film. Though I do have to say that the film tends to spend a bit too much time on some of the individual stories of the people who are affected by the spirits. The spirits do not physically harm anyone, until they are ready to take them to the spirit world with them. Before so, they do their best to literally scare the heck out of you. The woman and son who were killed by the woman's enraged husband (after discovering she was having an affair) have this almost pitiful sense. You are terrified by the spirits but because you know of their story, you also feel sorry for them. The house itself is haunted, but the spirit will follow anyone it has attracted itself to, so basically, once you enter the house, you are inevitably doomed.The movie isn't bad, but I can't say I was glued to the television the whole time. Stories of character stories tend to drag very badly, and all of the appearances of the spirits are entirely predictable.'\n",

This kind of weird movie is very oriental. Short, true, and rich in Zen: reflecting the unusual connotation in ordinary things. The narrative technique of the fierce bell at midnight is very westernized, rigorous and logical. The difference between these two points is not only reflected in the narrative technique, but also in the content. At midnight, the fierce bell is entangled in the content with the question of why a supernatural curse is possible. First of all, the protagonist has been looking for a reasonable explanation of the entire event, not only tracing, but also coping with this incomprehensible event; secondly, the story itself is also answering this question of why nature is possible. The curse is explained as a variant of smallpox virus. This rational attitude towards the supernatural is itself a characteristic of Western horror films. In the curse, both the film and the protagonist of the film seem to have no doubt about the possibility of a supernatural curse. The core factor in time causality is not logic but ethics. This is typical Eastern mysticism. From this transformation, can we see the development of the western center of culture towards a pluralistic center?'\n",

            "Review: 'After having heard friend after friend and review after review acclaim the Ju-On series, I had to look into seeing it. I don't normally like Japanese horror very much due to the fact that most of the films in that genre I've seen have been either too bleak and misanthropic (or flat-out needlessly violent) to endure, or simply incoherent or ludicrous and hard to take seriously. However, I got in a mood and decided to give it a try. At the very least, while I was at the grocery, I could get some ingredients for some New Year's food. At first I was confused as to which one came where and realized that I had rented the original first movie of the series (The Curse I) and the final movie of the series (The Grudge II), and had to go get the others and watch them all together. As I knew from my research that they were not particularly in chronological order from Curse to Grudge (and really seem like entirely separate universes), I first watched Curse I, and then Grudge I. I came away feeling, perhaps unsurprisingly, not totally satisfied.That isn't to say that The Grudge I is a bad film, it's just, well, not a particularly good one. Whatever some may say about sequels...and especially horror sequels...typically by the third movie they've gathered steam and have polished the formulae they employ in the course of the film. However, perhaps what Grudge I suffers from most is a complete lack of refinement that should be there, electing instead to plod along incomprehensibly and attempt to rehash better, more impacting scenes from Curse I, its predecessor.When I watched Curse, I was rather confused at first but gradually came to understand more and more of the plot, and that things were not unfolding chronologically. This added to the suspense and terror because it was not even possible for me as a viewer to know what was really going on, which is a disorienting thing and, in Ju-On, often makes you feel like one of the characters being affected by this curse of rage. However, in Grudge I it's simply incoherent for the sake of being incoherent at times, and it doesn't have the same sense of closure and passing the torch that even Curse had to an extent. In Grudge I, we encounter several characters who are poorly-defined and unsympathetic, and their circumstances fail to elicit any kind of response other than wanting to find another bread crumb that explains the mysterious house and its terrifying inhabitants, which by now we should already know about if we've seen even the first film in the series.There are some serious continuity and logical problems with Grudge I, which don't help it at all, and you are left trying to connect incidents that sometimes occur too far from each other (either in time or interpersonal link) to have a logical connection. The situations are also set up extremely poorly, with some of the 'cliffhangers' holding absolutely no believability to them; for example, when the two hardened police officers were confronted by the leisurely croaking Kayako, one wonders why they simply sat there making goofy faces at her. In Grudge I, we are drawn into a world that simply doesn't make any sense, which may be disorienting indeed, but after a certain point it doesn't make for a good movie narrative. If the audience is unable to suspend disbelief, then the audience will not be frightened or moved at all by the experience. This happened multiple times in Grudge: the characters often didn't behave realistically, the dialogue was sometimes forced, and the situations didn't make sense, so it wasn't scary because we couldn't believe they were happening and, by doing, become a part of the scene by acceptance.I was unable really to find too much evidence that the writer had actually worked hard to make the narrative more streamlined and acceptable for a theatrical release, and even the (presumed) main character Rika jaunted around with no real purpose or definition. She had little personality and did little more, and again she was also part of the 'not behaving realistically' taint of this film. It was difficult if not impossible to identify with her not only because almost none of her actions made any sense, but also because we didn't get to know her (as we should have) through the course of the film, as was reportedly the intent of introducing a character consistently present from start to finish.The character of Kayako did at least receive more than a few seconds in the spotlight, and it was a good gesture to remind the audience that she was the first victim and the originator of the grudge of rage that the house possessed, or perhaps if someone didn't make the connection, that she was the croaking monster. However, by the time we were reminded of this, it didn't matter; superior Japanese ghost stories or films (Sweet Home, for example) might have moved us to some sympathy or pity towards the tormented and consumed-by-rage entity and perhaps given us a slight amount of closure or satisfaction. Not so here, where we are yet again more moved towards confusion than any other emotion, when we see the face clearly of the formerly obscured-by-shadow Kayako.As for faces, probably my final detracting point from the film is the fact that a great deal of the casting was very, very inappropriate and even further damaged its believability. Kayako looked unexceptional and not scary at all. If perhaps she had been as deformed as the face on the possessed television, then it might have been terrifying. But she was simply very plain, which may be terrifying to the vain only. Many of the other actors were just not very good, or had too small parts to make any impression whatsoever. The possessed young husband (Katsuya I want to say) was one of the least believable in his role, and seems more suited to another genre with his style of acting. This isn't to say that any of these people were necessarily bad actors, just cast in roles that were not appropriate for them or suited to them. Truly the only actor in this that seemed to be fitting casting was probably Toshio's, although Rika did the best she could with the weak characterization she was given.The effects, quite plainly, were awful. The bizarre black fog was inexplicable (and unexplained) and cheap-looking, and equally shoddy was the 'ageing' makeup job on I believe it was Izumi's mother. Horrid, horrid, horrid. These bad and cheap things were scarier than the film itself. What made the original so creepy was that it didn't go out of its way to employ any effects beyond what its reportedly meagre budget allowed; this one, made after the tremendous success of the original pair of video releases, must have had at least twice the budget of those and managed to look not quite as good or convincing. It seems a prime example of budget not applied in the right places, and care not given to aspects that it should.I must state again that I don't think it was an irretrievably bad film, and it's certainly worth a viewing for perhaps a fan of the original, just to see how the material has been rearranged for the big screen. However, I don't think it's worthy of a complete newcomer watching it first; I would recommend The Curse I sooner than this film, simply because it's more interesting and better done. There is a kind of curiosity akin to that of the proverbial 'train wreck' in terms of seeing how sequels do to films you love. Sometimes you get lucky and sequels improve upon the original or add things that make the original even more interesting, or further the continuity. However, you take a chance in also getting things that are simply rehashed or less compelling, and usually you receive aspects of both of these.In Grudge I, it was like a retread of Curse I, with a few more things added and attempts to make it more coherent, that actually had the opposite effect. It was not particularly well written, casted, or acted, and I doubt I will sit through it again. From what I understand the remake of it addressed several issues I had with it, so perhaps that will prove to be a superior film. However, as it stands I would not recommend The Grudge I to anyone other than a fan of the original Curse, who simply must see how the house's legacy is realized for the big screen.'\n",

            "Review: 'My review for Juon 2003 was very nearly my shortest ever. For while you can talk about plot, characters, cast and crew for as long as you want, some movies can be completely summarised in just one word. Ju-On 2002 is one of those movies; the word best describing it rhyming with kite.This really is disappointing from start to finish. Although it's technically a remake of Takashi Shimizu's TV movie of the same name, you wouldn't know it by the plot which is completely different (to the point of unrecognition) and - for reasons unknown - the director has ditched the creepy, understated visuals of his original for a graphically explicit medley of blood, gore and other such unpleasantries. It's basically Halloween 2 to Halloween.Plot holes are evident throughout but one particular nuance was a break from the norm: all of the characters were likeable people and we did get to know them through some decent character development. I did come to care for Izumi, Rika and co. and for that, Ju-On deserves at least two stars. The supposedly creepy blue faced boy was just laughable, however; I'm told that this was rated one of the scariest movies of recent years in its native Japan. With genuinely suspenseful entries like 'Kairo' and 'Dark Water' to compete with, I find that extremely hard to believe!So, in summary, if you like the idea of the film - a spirit returning from the dead to haunt the new occupants of the house in which they were killed - and want to see how it can be handled effectively, watch the original television movie from 2000. If you're just a fan of Asian horror and think this could be the next \"Ringu\", do yourself a favour and save a few sheckles. Not recommended - ** / *****'\n",

Instead I'm going to cut to the chase and say that this film scared me on a near primal level. I watch a lot of horror and nothing has ever scared me like this.It seems many people don't find this frightening at all, I suppose it's horses for courses when it comes to a human being's fears. Some people have great big tarantulas as pets while some people faint when they see a spiderweb. If you have at some point in your life had fears about 'ghosts' and maybe a fascination about the supernatural, you may well be one of the people this film was made for.At the time of seeing this film (some 3 years ago) I was a call centre manager and it was my job to close and lock up the large office building in the evenings. After seeing Ju-On this became a bloody trauma every night! I was shaking and my heart pumping like crazy just waiting to hear that evil evil sound behind me. A grown man bricking it about ghosts from watching a film... Really now.Embarrassing as that is, this film brought back those forgotten horrors of childhood and damn it I love this film for that. Talk about emotional response.As a piece of cinema, this film is a strange one; haunting and eerie and strange throughout. There is a detached, stringy and dreamlike quality to it which is highly effective and a bit disorientating. It also features the best sound effect ever in the history of cinema as far as I'm concerned. I can't really give this less than a 10 since the effect it had on me was so powerful.A masterclass in terror, brilliant!'\n",

            "Review: 'The Japanese have a reputation for producing some of the scariest horror movies this generation has seen. From the absolutely terrifying \"Ringu\" to \"The Eye\" & \"Dark Water\", so naturally, after reading \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" was co-written by a writer of the original \"Ringu\", I was intrigued.I purchased this movie after seeing the trailer for the upcoming US remake with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and that looked interesting, considering the Americans usually tend to trash originals (the US remake of \"The Ring\" was a little disappointing), so I assumed the original would be far superior.The film opens with a slightly disturbing flash of images, including a blood stained man, an apparent murder of a cat(?) and a mysterious little boy. We later discover that a husband killed his wife and his son, and was found dead himself. The house is now inhabited by a new family, and Rika (our \"heroine\") is asked to go visit the elderly inhabitant. When she arrives, she discovers something hidden in a cupboard which is sealed by duct tape. When she opens it, she discovers a little boy. What she doesn't know, is she has unleashed a powerful curse.. the Ju-On. When ever someone dies in a state of rage, a curse is created, which then passes on to whoever comes into contact with it (according to famous Japanese legend). The movie follows the bizaare events that happen after, flashing between past and present, examining various inter-connected events to do with the house and the curse.The movie, at first, doesn't look terribly exciting. It does have a very cheap look, and it is a little slow to begin with, but once it picks up, it manages to pull in several disturbing scenes with demented imagery and jump moments. I admit to being quite scared through out this movie, but I always find myself scared watching any horror movie. The SPFX are low, but I give top marks \"Kayoko\", the victim who spreads the terrible curse, for her \"spider-walk\" and general menacing on screen presence (especially with the \"bones clicking\" and the strange chattering noise she seems to emit). The little boy isn't as menacing as other people will try and make you believe, simply because all he does is \"appear\" now and then, and \"meow\", which lets face it, isn't really frightening. But when combined with all the other elements, it works, and will leave you with an unsettled feeling. I was particularly disturbed during a scene involving CCTV footage, which shows a black shape walking down a corridoor, before looming up onto the camera, and out of the fuzziness, we see two pale eyes, which almost leaves you with a feeling that they are actually looking directly at you.Overall, it's not excellent, it's not going to win any awards, but, following the tradition of \"ringu\", the sinister atmosphere and camera angles pave the way for a memorable experience that will jangle your nerves. The American remake looks promising, let's just hope they keep to the original plot.*** out of 5'\n",

            "Review: 'I must say despite all of it's shortcomings in terms of character development and pacing (Jesus Christ it should have ended at about the fifth segment!!!!) Takashi Shimizu's \"Ju-On\" remains one of the most startlingly unconventional horror films I've ever seen, even by ridiculous Japanese standards. Its baroque high concept fantasy elements are surreal and outlandish no doubt, but writer/director Takashi Shimizu chooses to ground all this with some of the most flat and restrained direction and cinematography in any genre. The movie looks like it could have been shot on some teenage kid's digital video camera (and given the budget it might very well have been). There's no \"movie bullshit\": everything that happens just more or less happens. It goes a long way for selling these fantastic happenings as real life to the audience. The music score is fantastic, choosing to go for haunting mournful tunes instead of standard Psycho-inspired hijinks. And of course the sound design is responsible for at least 25% of the scares (cue the famous throat rattle...) And then there's the ending: I wouldn't call it a \"twist ending\" because the film doesn't spend much of its time trying to pull the wool over your eyes and the ending doesn't dramatically reshape your understanding of the story up til that point; but it is indeed a clever surprise! Very much in the great Lovecraft tradition: spinning a yarn til its end and then throwing in that nice extra surprise at the last moment! (Shimuzu's Lovecraft influences are on display even more prominently in his later and much better film \"Marebito\"). All this is fantastic, but Ju-On fails on one key level and that is pacing. The film drags horribly in between spook scenes. The film slaves to its gimmick of introducing a new main character every ten minutes. The idea starts out novel but grinds on well past its worth. Instead of roughly ten sequences at roughly ten minutes each, five sequences at twenty would have been far more effective. Only a few of the perspective changes are essential to telling the story and having to pick up the pieces every ten minutes as to where we are in the plot is distracting. Also this would have allowed for more character development, instead of a barrage of exposition as to who the new victim is. Again, this is obviously Lovecraft influence, but it's very uncinematic. The acting is pretty standard: no one stands out which is kind of appropriate since its a revolving cast of characters. Overall, a flawed but worthwhile effort and a must for any horror fan.'\n",

            "Review: 'This is actually the THIRD film in the four-film Ju-on series, though it's the first theatrical release. It helps to watch the two preceding direct-to-video releases first, since those establish the origin of the curse effectively. Also, without seeing these prequels, the plot of this one can probably seem kind of meandering.Shot on an extremely low budget, Ju-on doesn't have the cash to spend on elaborate special make-up effects or over-the-top set pieces (and the few times these movies do try to use FX, it tends to look pretty cheap). But to compensate for that, director Takashi Shimizu has crafted a story that generates scares through atmosphere, mood and lighting. There aren't that many \"jump\" scenes in the movie, though there are a couple of good ones; mostly, what Shimizu does is create a lingering sense of unease that can be very disturbing if you catch it in the right mood.So, if you liked The Others, you'll go for Ju-on. On the other hand, if you're a Freddy and Jason fan, looking for the usual bombastic, loud body-count sort of horror, you'll hate it.I happen to prefer moody horror, and I think it's more effective to scare people that way than just by throwing tubs of gore and CGI effects in your face. But I think most Americans have been conditioned to expect their horror movies to be very MTV-ish in style, and so this movie may just be too foreign for most U.S. viewers.7/10'\n",

And \"Ju-on\" doesn't rise to the challenge.The film is told in a number of \"vinettes\" about people who have come in contact with a haunted house of sorts. None of the stories were very compelling and the lack of imaginative story-telling was furthered by a underdeveloped set and poor lighting. If a house is to be the setting of such horrific crimes one would think that they should get some sort of threatening feeling about it. But in fact one gets the opposite feeling, faulting the bright lighting and lack-luster set design. The director seemed to think that the oddity of the story would grab our interest enough to distract the viewer from realizing that there wasn't a strong story present. Even though the mysteries of the deaths kept me going to the end, I didn't feel like I got any pay-off or satisfying explanation to why the story(s) took place. There was some stunning cinematography involving the child and the mother, but it wasn't enough to either surprise me or make me recommend the film. Perhaps the director should reconsider a 2nd sequel and explore something new.Want some good modern Japanese horror films, then try \"Ringu\" (1998), \"Ôdishon\" (1999) and \"Uzumaki\" (2000).'\n",

This is actually the downfall of this film. It follows the same scare tactics as it's predecessors and sums up to be nothing new - white powder make-up ghosts - check - long-haired scary females - check - set-piece in a lift - check. If this had been here first, it would have been so much more effective.Contrary to belief these films do not employ jump-out your seat scares, more \"Oh, sh*t, what the f**k is that\" kinda chills, and this is where The Grudge works. Basically its 90 minutes of set-piece scares and offers nothing in the way of plot or sense, but these scenes are well-thought out and effectively handled.A lot of people don't know that this is the 3rd film in a series of 4 (the first two were DTV), so like most horror sequels the plot and characterisation is done and dusted in the first film, and regurgitated (in most cases puked) again in the following sequels. This is, per say, like the 3rd Nightmare or Friday 13th film.However Ju-On 3 is much better than all Freddy or Jason sequels and any silly \"teen horror\" film Hollywood regurgitates, employing real horror and atmosphere. It also works as a great introduction to Japanese horror for any people unaware of its impact.6 pints out of 10.'\n",

I chose this movie to comment on because, out of the ones I have seen, it is my favorite, (unfortunately, I haven't seen the original TV versions.) Ju-On: The Grudge is my first favorite, then Ju-On: The Grudge 2, then The Grudge, then The Grudge 2.Ju-On: The Grudge is my first favorite because of the story/filming style, originality/atmosphere, and the scares. Although it is told in a nonlinear-style storyline, it is still explicitly detailed in the way that each character meets their fate. I'm a fan of cinematography, and I think the way Takashi Shimizu choreographs each camera angle is genius. Well choreographed camera angles are vital in horror movies, and if your filming style is done proficiently, I can guarantee the viewers will be satisfied. Everything about this movie is absolutely original. That's one of the things American horror films lack these days. I don't consider a violent, bloody slasher movie a horror film. Sure someone wielding a knife is scary, but not cinematically. The atmosphere and music definitely supply an eerie feeling. I generally don't get scared easily in horror films. The only time I get \"scared\" is when a loud noise happens and makes me jump. However, watching this film actually made me uncomfortable due to the atmosphere and the musical score.The scares propelled the story. The bizarre state of Kayako's ghost made it difficult to watch when she haunted her victims. If a horror movie makes me feel uncomfortable, it is made very well.Ju-On: The Grudge 2 was slightly lower than the first film. The story in this film was also nonlinear, but was told and tied together better. The filming style was done very well,like the first film. Being that it was a sequel, of course it wasn't AS original as the first one. It had its similarities to the first film, but it also certainly had its differences. The atmosphere was also very similar to the first film. The scares were also done just as well as the first film. So as you can see, there is VERY little difference between my ranking of them.For a remake, I suppose The Grudge wasn't so bad. It was definitely lower than the originals though. The story was good, but it was slow at times. The filming style also lacked quality to keep the viewers interested in the plot.I think this movie's highest flaw was it's originality. It was basically a remake of the first film, but with parts from both Ju-On: The Curse and parts from Ju-On: The Grudge 2. The atmosphere was slightly less eerie than the Japanese versions, I suppose because the set was different than the Japanese house, but was still quite eerie. In my opinion, the scares of this movie are equal in effectiveness to the ones in the Japanese versions, but only because they used better quality special effects.I went to see the Grudge 2 in the theater on the first night and I came out very very disappointed. I didn't like the story because there were three different stories, all of which were low quality and not very interesting. The filming style wasn't nearly as good as it was in any of the previous three movies.The originality WAS the highest flaw in this movie. They took parts from each previous movie in the series and altered them and added very few different scene styles. The atmosphere was not at all scary because of the locations and the fact that they rarely had horror scenes in the house where the curse originated.The scares were another major factor in why I didn't care for it very much. For some reason, they took out all the scares that they showed in the commercials. Every time I saw a part that I recognized from the commercials, I got excited, but only found that they took those parts out. Although I was highly disappointed, I will still buy the DVD when they come out with the unrated version. I think they are adding all the horror scenes not seen in the theater to the actual version.So overall, the reason I like the Japanese versions more is because of originality, atmosphere, and the scares. I think the only way to make them better would be to slightly enhance the special effects. Other than that, I love the Japanese versions and I think that anyone who has seen either of the American remakes should definitely consider watching these as well. I hope my review helped.'\n",

Just when I thought I'd seen it all as far as horror films are concerned, along comes Ju-On and not only scared me in the theatre, I found that its effects affected my hope of a goodnight's sleep that evening.It works brilliantly and the whole shift back and forth in time only intensifies the experience. The images shock you as it is, but then the brain works overtime trying to piece together the narrative, struggling to make sense of what is a total mind-f*** of a story (kinda like 21 grams', only way better). The sound effects editing on this film are something else; probably the best since The Exorcist'. It all works in unison to deliver what is probably one of the most terrifying movies to land this century. Look and learn Hollywood!'\n",

I think it's one of those films you have to see once, whether you dislike it or not. The plot: It's there, certainly, but very thin since it's horror. Besides the small amount of back story on why the house is haunted, the movie only consists of random events happening. 5/10Characters: What characters? They were ordinary people, so you can relate to them, but forgettable as all hell. 0/10Horror Imagery: Classic and creepy, just as it should be. 7/10 This Japanese version is better than the remakes because: There is no dramatic music: so you can never tell when something's going to happen. In the remake they would build up all this music... you think \"Oh great, scary bit coming up. Brace yourselves\" then nothing happens, and it's a stupid repetitive cycle. All three remakes are in the one: so it more quickly gets to the point. Acting is brilliant and filled with emotion!Of course this movie won't change your life... so you can easily skip it without missing lots.

I have seen many horror films in the past years, and as far as I remember the only one worth remembering was the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This was until I sat down in a Spanish cinema and watched Ju-On. I was disappointed of the far overrated Cabin Fever and decided I should have on more go. I didn't know anything about this movie - and anyone who saw this one in cinema will understand when I write - that it took me completely by storm. Guys around me started chatting or making stupid jokes, when the real horror began, but this is just the usual reaction of local heroes proving how masculine they are to their 14 year old girlfriends. It may be true, that it's quite difficult to follow the storyline (is there any?), or not to confuse the characters (sorry, but to me all japanese look the same, except Mr. Myagi) but one that's for sure is, that I never ever felt so much real fear caused by a movie in my whole life. This one isn't about cheap booo!-moments, what you get here is nothing but sheer terror, and this is what so many horror fans waited for so desperately. OK - Local heroes around the world, gather your girls and nerves and prove that YOU are the man, because this is just the picture for it.'\n",

I've heard a lot of stuff, like how Asian horror movies are the scariest, or that the Ringu and Ju-On have ruined childhoods, so I thought I'd give this movie a try, in hopes it would genuinely make me feel scared. I've been looking for a movie to scare me for the longest time, but to no avail. All I can say is after all the good words about this movie, and after watching the movie my self I don't think \"disappointed\" does justice to explain exactly how depressed I am after watching this students-project excuse of a movie.First of all, there's too many characters, all were 2D and dispensable. None of them were interesting and we weren't properly introduced to any of them. They all died, so who cares.Scares were cheap, often jump-scares or loud noises like a random orchestra hitting the drums or using the violin whacked up to 200% volume. I even fell victim and raised my volume because all these cardboard dispensable side characters are whispering to each other like they're scared the clap of their dummy thick ass cheeks will alert the ghosts to their location, and as a result had my ears drilled by a Big Black Sound effect when a women looked at a child. Can't make this stuff up.I got to the 50 minute mark of the movie, and even if I had a gun to the side of my head I wouldn't be able to tell you the events of the last 10 minutes because I genuinely can't remember. That's how bored I was.All I have to say is if this movie scared you, you're either new to horror movies or were shown at a ridiculously young age. Peace out, not recommended.'\n",

I let it rot for a few days before sticking it in the VCR when I was alone and bored.How deeply it affected me is about on par with this first production movie. To put it simply, this series of films are terrifying and genius, but only if a certain qualities are met.First of all, NEVER watch this movie with a loud person or someone who chatters through a movie. In fact, watch it alone so you won't laugh either. Some aspects seem absurd, but when there's no one to laugh with, you won't get distracted.And genius because the director has completely broken from the standard norm of American or Japanese horror movies. Honestly? I'm tired of Ringu clones. This movie shows a startlingly workable change in plot style, suspense and theatrics. Instead of hiding the monster, it's there at every second. Instead of yet another boring, convoluted plot, it simply exist as a video time line of events as this plague of supernatural rot spreads.I love this movie, and as long as you stay away from laughers, you very well might too.'\n",

What I will say is this film works especially well as a superbly paced horror/thriller movie, with more than a handful of moments that will leave you anxious and unnerved.For a majority of films in this style (a ghost story with very little emphasis on gore and violence, although those elements play a part), the idea and unseen presence of a malevolent force is far creepier than actually seeing it fully revealed on camera. This is not really the case for Ju-on: The Grudge. The scariest moments by far consist of the actual shots of the film's antagonists and supernatural beings. Their unorthodox movements and appearance are some of the more terrifying things to behold on a small or big screen (at least in the case of mainly Western movie watchers such as myself).The plot is not needlessly complex, although others have mentioned the occasional confusion resulting from the non-chronological order of the story. I almost guarantee that you will not be watching this film with the intent of following the plot progression; this film simply provides a real scare the likes of which have only occasionally been witnessed in the horror genre.Highly recommended for those who value a great fright.'\n",

Ju-On and Ju-On 2 are fairly low tech, but very effective, and neither film wastes any time with useless back story or character development. They get right on with the scary stuff. What these films demonstrate is that good horror does not require expensive sets, puppets or special effects. Often it is the simple tales that tap into our innate fear of the unknown and skillfully use cinematic technique to both reveal and hide just enough information to cause a fearful reaction. I noticed my son closed the window in his room that night and I myself was a little more interested in what might be lurking in the darker places in the house.

The events are broken up into chunks and told out of order, which is incredibly effective in maintaining the audience's interest and creating mystery.

As a viewer, one is led through a maze of startling interconnected events occurring in different times and places, all somehow related to the horrifying curse.This film is, and will long be, one of my personal favorites. From beginning to end, it is superbly written, acted, directed and executed by all parties involved. I was immediately drawn into this story by the graphic and troubling opening scene, and my interest did not flag in the slightest throughout the remainder of the movie. The initially confusing plot twists and distorts itself, eventually coming together in a mind-blowing climax that will make you say, wide eyed, \"Oh! I get it now!\" A feeling of growing dread accompanied me as I watched, and I frequently had the urge to look away from the screen. In my opinion, inspiring that kind of genuine fear in its viewers is what makes a horror movie truly outstanding.So who shouldn't bother watching? If you preferred Ghost Ship over Ringu, Ju On is definitely not for you. This cinematic masterpiece is in a completely different league than the insipid, run-of-the-mill American horror movies we are spoon fed on a yearly basis.

I am sure there are scarier Japanese horror movies to watch than this one, so just jump over to those.'\n",

            "Review: 'Warning! May contain Spoilers!By: Christopher Yagi Review of 'Ju-on: The Grudge' (not the original TV version) Genre: Horror Director: Shimizu Takashi Year: 2003The Grudge. Quite an understatement, considering the body count. Anyway, if you've taken a good look at all the recent Asian horror cinema shows, you'll see that they're a nice bundle of condensed awesome more from its atmosphere than its visuals. Ju-on takes that, guts out the story, and bumps up the visuals, while keeping some of the atmosphere. What I got was something that gave pretty mixed feelings about what, exactly, I think of the movie. On one hand, it was purely based on freak aspects, depriving me of several weeks of good sleep without a floodlight somewhere in the room. Therefore, I kinda liked it. On the other hand, there was no story. Okay, there were a few background details, like how one character was a social worker, another was a teacher, and all that. But really, so what? Even soap operas have better background details than that.The story starts with a message, saying how a Ju-on is something about a person dying a horrible horrible death, and getting really pissy about it. And so there was this woman, dying a horrible horrible death at the hands of her husband wielding an X-acto knife. Their little boy hides out, apparently avoiding the same fate, so instead the cat bites the dust. None too pleased, the woman haunts the house she lives in, and so does the cat. Except the cat apparently possessed the boy or something, because in some parts of the movie the boy kinda screams like one. And so, a bunch of people at different times walk into the house for one reason or another, and, in a nutshell, dies a horrible horrible death, ultimately from the hands of the woman. Since the movie jumps from one time frame to another, I'll put all the deaths in chronological order. A couple moves into the house with the husband's mother, and they both die kinda mysteriously, but seemingly from the catboy. The husband's sister drops by for a visit but was told to go back home by her doomed brother. However, the woman and the boy manage to follow her home. Her quick thinking got her under her bed covers, where surely the ghosts would never see her. Needless to say, she was dragged away. The husband's mother dies during a game of peek-a-boo with the social worker. I think. The social worker's boss comes in, and later on just dies, but under a sink in a hospital, for whatever reason. A cop tries to burn the place down but eventually runs into the ghost. Doing the whole \"deer staring into a speeding car's headlights\" thing, he sits and screams as he comes face-to-face with the ghost. Just then, his colleagues come in, hold hands, and screams as the cop does the smart thing for a change and dashes out the door. Oh, he dies too. The social worker mentioned earlier lives on for quite a while, compared to everyone else. Then she dies, and so does one of her friends. And lastly, the daughter of the cop mentioned earlier dies not only from the woman, but from three of her zombified friends.Okay, fine, the story sucks miserably. So instead, what the movie tries to get you to do is to ignore the story basically, but immerse you into horror after horror. This, at least, was done well since the visuals were downright creepy. Well, it can't really be properly described in words, it's one of those \"see for yourself\" kinda things. If I try to put it into words, I'll just end up sounding silly. Does \"little boy with mascara\" sound scary to you?The acting, on the part of the two ghosts, were good, but repetitive since they kinda ended people's lives the same way every time. Except for the woman at the stairs at the very end, which was probably the best scene in the whole movie. The other actors had no problem freaking out since the ghosts were seriously unsettling to see.The verdict:5 out of 8 - I'm currently sleeping with a nightlight on. That counts for something, I guess.(c) 2004 Eight Trees CineMANIA'\n",

Its like a really really really bad Japanese \"twin peaks\"If you have ever in your life seen a movie, and I mean any movie, skip this one..... I compare it to a thunderstorm....looks scary, sounds scary, begins abruptly and ends the same...but when you use your brain, even a little...you realize that it's just a bunch of random crappy visuals with no real terror backing it up...SO like I said, If you have never ever seen a movie and find yourself scared of your own shadow....you may get a kick out of this one... But if you like cinema and have a brain, you will be angry at the end of the film when you realize that you wasted your time on thrills you could have replicated by looking in the mirror and saying \"BOO!!\" I cant even believe they are making an American version...... watch how bad it gets bashed...watch...mark my words....if they don't put a plot into it.....critics will rape it...

Saying this, I can't help notice the many similarities it shares with the Ring (I find myself saying this a lot about Japanese Horror movies, do writers like to use it as a basis for all latter projects?!) notably the 'cursed girl', who, like most Japanese 'ghost girls' have very long hair, covering most or the entirety of their faces, and walk or crawl after their victims in a weird fashion. That aside, the movie was unusually fast paced for a Japanese horror in my opinion, with suspense building in almost every scene. Although relying on music too much to build up the suspense it manages to chill, scare and make you jump often enough.

Then we have .....Ju-onThis series came about originally as a two-part TV movie in Japan.Two theatrical versions were brought to the public afterwards. In October of 2004 another Ju-on titled \"The Grudge\" (which is supposedly a pseudo-retelling of this movie) will be shown in theaters.Here the first theatrical release added depth to make the original story behind it seem stronger. Basically the plot behind this is a curse that haunts a home in Japan. Anyone who becomes involved with the house is trapped within the curse's grip, and one by one the characters (or victims) seem confused and have no idea what will happen to them until its too late at least towards the end with an unsuspected ending that leaves you asking yourself \"Why does it have to end here?\"This film gets really creepy and the first couple of times I had watched this I had a little trouble sleeping. The actors really get you into their emotions so you can relate to their fears. The direction is very unique by setting the film into segments/chapters. But I'm pretty sure you are most curious of what lurks in this curse, Toshio and Kayako. The idea of creating these horrifying figures is very creative which is unusual in what you would find in most horror films of today. The sound effects and music were greatly used as well in this movie. However there are some weak points in this film but its not really noticeable.If you want gore you'll see some of it but its no slasher flick at all. This movie's intent is to psychologically warp your mind with a little bit of confusion and a ton of suspense. All in all the movie is worth giving a try since people's fears can vary with this film, meaning it could or could not be scary. Do not think of this as a cursed videotape that kills you in seven days.'\n",

So far i've been left totally confused at Akira, Ghost In The Shell, just about every other anime in my boyfriends collection, The Ring and most recently Ju-on: The Grudge only yesterday.What drove me to watch Ju-on: The Grudge was an advert for it's American adaptation. It looked pretty good. I initially thought it was an advert for 'The Ring 2' what with the trademark ghosty girlies with long black hair covering half of their face. Then i saw Sarah Michelle Geller and thought it pretty weird for her to take lead role in the film. Then saw it wasn't 'The Ring' - it was 'The Grudge'. It actually looked quite good. Later that day we saw the original Japanese version and bought it, thinking how clever we were. When we got home we put it in the DVD player and watched it. Just like when we watched 'The Ring', i was constantly asking who was who and trying to get my head around the plot. No matter how much i thought about it, i just couldn't understand quite what was going on. When i thought i did, something happened that totally confused me again. It reminded me of watching 'The Matrix' and 'Donnie Darko' which confused me equally (and also had a massive cult following for some reason.)At this precise moment in time, i'm searching for the plot on the internet.

However this factor does not deter Japanese creative production teams to come up with movie gems, in different genres.In the realm of Japanese horrors for example, a studio working with a limited budget has to resort to Jaws-style direction, in which you hardly see or visualise the ghosts/monsters.And it is through the movie's simplicity, or by not showing/explaining too much, that J-horrors have turned up the notch on the haunting and horror levels through movies such as Ring and Dark Water. Of course there are the still plenty of gorefest movies such as Suicide Circles and Ichi the Killer, the latter being a courtesy of that notorious but prolific J-director, Takashi Miike.So it is remarkable and truly rewarding to see how Miike toned down his tastes for the twisted and perverted in One Missed Call. Furthermore he implemented his flair of storytelling through symbolisms and graphic metaphors quite nicely. Any shock/gore elements were used in such a way that they serve the movie, instead of downgrading it to a cheesy flick.In conclusion, One Missed Call satisfies on many levels, providing you keep an open mind and just enjoy the ride. Another plus of the movie is the appearances of several gorgeous J-idols, such as Kazue Fukishii and Kou Shibasaki. Nifty!'\n",

He was right! RINGU can be considered as the original one that started it all (because of being the first big hit in the genre, for one thing). I'm not even gonna argue about whether it's the best J-horror movie or not. But I am gonna say that ONE MISSED CALL is without a doubt, on some levels, more effective than RINGU. Where Sadako's ghostly tale of terror was sort of touching the boundaries and establishing some clearly defined characteristics of the genre, CHAKUSHIN ARI pushes the boundaries and uses these characteristics as a reference to the genre.Miike handles a very tight script and a plot that has virtually no holes and a lot of eye for details. Almost every little aspect that is being mentioned in the plot, carries a little set-up within that delivers a pay-off later. The story is intriguing. The death scenes are original and rather graphic. The ghostly creepiness is there. Every jump-scare works (there was one were I almost went through the roof! I recommend watching this with the sound turned up a notch; just let it blast out of the speakers, and I guarantee you: you will jump!). The conclusion is great and practically unpredictable; the twists were damn good. And then there's Miike, who just once again had to give this movie that Miike-touch of his, making it all just one bit more special in a way. And this time, surprisingly, he doesn't do it in the usual way. Not be inserting a sickening scene, or adding some repulsive imagery (though some events and effects really are quite gruesome). No. This time he does it by taking the movie to a different level, by adding that very last scene. And the very last shot should normally have you thinking about something that someone in a very brief scene said, earlier in the movie. The effect it had on me was: wanting to re-watch the movie. Now that's just great if a movie manages to do that. So maybe I should really rate this one 10/10. But I'll reserve that rating for THE AUDITION, my favorite Takashi Miike film ever (for now, at least).And, by the way: I'm ready for the re-make. It's gonna be directed by Frenchman Eric Valette, who previously directed the magnificent, claustrophobic & Lovecraftian-like MALÉFIQUE. For once, I just might have a little faith in an upcoming re-make.'\n",

            "Review: 'After \"Audition\" and \"Ichi The Killer\", I had great expectations for this movie. What it delivers is essentially the \"greatest hits\" of Asian horror. There's more than a passing resemblance to \"The Ring\", with bits of \"Ju-On\" and other films thrown in for good measure.The film revolves around mobile 'phones. A girl has a message left on her mobile 'phone answering service - only it's been left by herself and in the future! To make matters worse, it ends with a blood curdling scream! Well, it soon turns out that the message is the girl's final words on this mortal coil.The girl is not alone. It's only a matter of time before the body count starts rising and a race against time begins to solve the mystery of the bizarre calls.Despite being more than a shade Ringu-clone-esquire, I heartily enjoyed this film. It has some great set-pieces (including a memorable death), some spooky moments, a few \"jump\" sequences, etc. What the film didn't deliver, though, was any real fear. It was a case of \"seen it all before\" (a criticism that some levelled at \"Ju-On\").The plot unravels in a logical manner and there's a decent pay off. It may not be a future classic, but this is a very well made example of Asian horror cinema.My rating: 8 out of 10 for a stylish addition to Miike's portfolio'\n",

            "Review: 'It is hard to do something new in the world of horror these days.  Even Japanese horrors which were deemed fresh in the late 90's got more and more repetitive, and we can say that after Kairo, there is nothing really fresh coming out of the horror department of Japanese films.  The quiet atmosphere and the fear towards darkness within colorless world possessed by vicious female ghosts is no longer new to both Japan and the rest of the world. Ju-ons (all of them except the part 2 of the one made only for video which sucked badly) are scary; the series break the silent rule of Japanese horrors, its director even say that he tried to go the opposite way Nakata and Kurosawa went, he will scare the audience by showing the ghosts and gore as much as possible.  And Ju-ons worked, to some extent; the director is successful in creating the world of nightmare that co-exist with the ordinary world that people live in.  He use a normal house/apartment as his stage of fear and bring out all the every possible scare out of every corner of that place.  But one can also say that Ju-ons are good only in parts; its strength is just the sum of a few very scary scenes that the director successfully created and not the overall atmosphere or the story of the films.  Now it's time for the ever creative Miike who once scared the hell out of the audience, not by using ghosts, but using a sadistic but innocent-looking girl, to put some new blood into Japanese horrors.  As a big fan of J-horror and Miike, I was so looking forward to the film and that I was afraid my high expectation will kill it, but the result was beyond my expectation, I enjoyed this thrill ride so much I wish it would never end.\n",
            "In terms of story, Chakushin Ari is nothing new.  It's the Ring plus mobile phone plus Miike trademark's world of weirdness.  However, it's execution is a very good blend of Nakata's the silent and dark world and Simizu's bang bang ghost is coming style, and the result, IMHO, is very fresh and satisfying.  Miike has toned down his weird and over-the-top scenes to suit the taste of wider audiences, but this film is still full of creative and scary scenes (the scene at the TV station which I deem so good it's classic, and the scene at the hospital which is so weird and spooky that I wish it could last longer) with quite satisfying story and (many may argue) acceptable open ending.  Although his ingredients are nonetheless recycle of old tricks (everything from dark corners, female ghosts, old apartments, old hospitals, scary-as-hell sound effects, and right out of the screen gore and ghosts), they are orchestrated in such a stylish and enjoyable way that I can't help jumping and flinching while at the same time enjoying the ever rushing adrenalin in my vein.  Repetitive, may be, but fresh ideas are still everywhere; Miike stood very good balance between Nakata's atmospheric scare/strong story and Shimizu illogically outrageous and bizarre world. In sum, a very very entertaining grade A pure horror (not psychological thriller in disguise) which is both repetitive and fresh at the same time. This film should satisfied both hardcore horror fans and those who want satisfying entertainment.'\n",

            "Review: 'While in a bar with her friends, the teenager Yoko Okazaki (Anna Nagata) receives a call in her cellular with a voice mail from the future telling the date and time when she would die. On the next day, Yumi overhears a group of students talking about the urban legend that people connected in the address book of cellular are mysteriously receiving phone calls with date and time of their death in the near future. In the precise informed hour, Yoko is attacked by a supernatural force in a train station while talking to her friend Yumi Nakamura (Kou Shibasaki) by phone and dies with severed arm and leg. Yumi seeks out Kioto's boyfriend Kenji Kawai (Atsushi Ida), who also received a call, and witnesses his death in an elevator shaft. When her roommate Natsumi Konishi (Kazue Fukiishi) receives a call, Yoko befriends Hiroshi Yamashita (Shin'ichi Tsutsumi), who tells her that his sister Ritsuko (Azusa) that worked in the Child Guidance Center with abused children was the first victim of the phone call. While in the hospital, Yumi hears an asthma pump and recalls that she heard the same noise when Kenji died. They decide to investigate victims of asthma in the hospital and find the name of Marie Mizunuma and her daughters Mimiko and Nanako. They search the family together trying to save Natsumi from her fate.\"Chakushin Ari\" is scary like most of the Asian horror movies, and has a promising beginning supported by a great acting and a good plot. However, the last quarter of the movie is confused, not clear, needing interpretation; therefore, the screenplay writer Minako Daira or the cult director Takashi Miike or both failed since they were not able to transmit a clear conclusion of the story to the audience. I glanced in IMDb the most different interpretations for the end of the story to ratify my opinion. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"Ligação Perdida\" (\"Missed Call\")'\n",

            "Review: 'This movie has a more than interesting and good premise and it also has a real promising beginning but as the movie and its story start to progress more the movie actually gets worse and starts to drag and become overlong.Japanese horror movies are well known and appreciated over the world now days, due to the global success of several genre pieces, with of course \"Ringu\" as the best example of this. And even though these movies are always well made and good looking ones, there are often more or less the same. Aside from its premises, they are often hardly original in their execution, with the exception of an occasional memorable and effective sequences. And yes, this movie is also pretty much more of the same. It's welcome for the fans of it but it's just offering too little originality, which makes this a movie you'll easily forget.This is a pretty mainstream movie for normal Takashi Miike standards. Guess he needs to make these type of movies, every once in a while, before he can continue and finance his other movie projects, that are less mainstream and just plain odd and weird with their style and approach. But it are still the movies he is known for and also most appreciated more by people all over the world. I'm not a fan of just all of his movies but often his weirdness, extreme graphic violence and humorous approach of it all can still appeal to me and make his movies something unique and enjoyable for me. But this movie really doesn't has any of that. It's made in the same style as any other popular Japanese horror movie, which means that this movie will probably also disappoint most Takashi Miike lovers.Thing with this movie is that it has an alright story and main premise in its beginning but the more it all progresses the harder it gets to understand and the less interest you'll keep in this movie. It's the reason why the movie feels like it's dragging at points and feels also certainly overlong. This is a movie that should at least had been 20 minutes shorter really.This also certainly goes at the expense of the horror and mystery of the movie. Horror-wise this movie is certainly disappointing in what it is offering. Again, because it's being nothing too original but also because the movie it's story-telling doesn't really get you involved with things and therefore a lot of the mystery and tension dies off pretty quick already. It also doesn't help that the movie becomes more and more confusing toward its ending.But overall, this movie still does a lot of things well. It's certainly not any worse than the average Japanese horror entry and despite all of its problems, I still consider this a watchable movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/'\n",

It's definitely not slow paced like dark water and a lot more entertaining.But if your like me, when you watch a zombie movie you expect zombies,if you watch a killer movie you expect killings so if you watch a Japanese horror movie expect a grudge cause it's a part of the Japanese mythology so don't go crying out loud that this movie sucks because it's a pale imitation of ringu and ju-on, IT IS NOT!!!! so, i give this movie 10/10 for three reason: 1: a lot of good scares 2: a very effective and disgusting grudge 3: entertaining from opening credits to the end'\n",

Why can't Hollywood keep their dirty fingers away when they fail in their own miserable creativity. Anyhow...I've just started to dig deeper into the works of Takashi Miike and I have no problems admitting that his movies are awesome. Chakushin ari is another ghost tale but it gets a bit special when Miike-san is in charge of things. What you get in Chakushin ari is, besides the beautiful surroundings and awesome camera work, tension, thrills and a plot which does quite good for being in this genre. It has its moments of originality and compared to the works of Hideo Nakata, I'd say Miike here accomplish a heavier load of tension throughout the whole movie, while Nakata's movies have tension coming in waves, sort of.I have really nothing to whine about here or rant at. The actors are doing a good job and the piece kept me interested throughout the entire playtime. Thumbs up.'\n",

            "Review: 'I've noticed that B-grade horror directors always try to scare us with otherworldly visitors, plate-throwing spooks, etc. but, as Kubrick wondered, why be afraid of ghosts? It's proof of life beyond death! This is why A-grade directors like Kubrick, Dreyer, Miike, Hitchcock, and Shymalan, realize that the true horror is existence itself, incomprehensible in its mortality, its suffering, its hopelessness. We all die; therefore, WE are the ghosts. It's the same kind of reversal you see in that Casper short where he meets a living human child and screams, the same way the boy screamed upon seeing him.In One Missed Call, Miike quietly confesses to a deep, profound spirituality that was only apparent beforehand in his obvious contempt for everything and everyone who lacks Buddhist poise ( and the only character who even had that was Grandpa in Happiness of the Katakuris: \"Yeah!\" ) The movie is split into two parts. The first is a parodistic one involving lots of cell phones and tropes from The Ring, Ju-On, and other recent J-horror movies. I admit this phenomenon never made any sense to me, it was just visual noise based on memories of Poltergeist and Japanese folk tales. But Miike, who makes movies the way other people write 800-page books of philosophy, converts pop-culture dross into Renaissance-art gold, drawing out and savoring the connection, only hinted at in The Ring, between the way technology gives us the illusion of having superhuman capabilities ( talk to anyone on earth, at any time of the day! send them a video of yourself doing jumping jacks naked! ) but fails outright to protect us from the inevitable: death. You know that dread you feel when your Internet connection breaks down and you're \"cut off from the world\"? Miike exploits this modern fear to the limit in the greatest horror scene since the one in the shower, or 9-11 itself -- I'm talking about the very public death of Natsumi Konishi.The second half of the movie tracks the heroine as she tries to locate the source of the malevolent phone calls who are picking off her friends left and right, hoping to escape the same fate. Her journey eventually takes her to a disused hospital, where the film's second great scene takes place, as death reaches out to life, as the departed try to close the gap between them and us. Those expecting to be \"scared\" won't be; others who know how to watch films without expectations, and may have seen Ordet or Vampyr, will find this scene to be curiously sorrowful and moving unlike anything they've seen before. The movie would have been a classic if it had ended here, but Miike, as he always does, spins out his concept to dizzying, unimaginable lengths, as the movie begins to concentrate more on its hero, Hiroshi, who seems to embody a very Christian kind of ethos: \"When knighthood was in flower\" and all of that, like Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven. I won't spoil the ending, but as he discovers, the \"ghost\" turns out to be a variant of Ichi, from Ichi the Killer, a destructive innocent, and it's the hero's sympathy, his capacity for loving the unlovable, that not only saves his life but wins him eternal love and eternal childhood -- the symbol for which is the candy that he rolls about in his mouth in the final shot.No point in complaining that One Missed Call is too mainstream. Like so many other crossover movies, from Gangs of New York to Lovers on the Bridge, future generations will discover that genuine subversion resides in the collision between mainstream values and the truth; in fact, that collision IS the truth: Independent purity duking it out with the world, rather than sitting in its iron lung, all spotless and lily-white. Who wants to see a movie where the director rigs his own little belief system, his own critics, his own executioners? Every indie director, if he wants to be a great director, needs to make a large-budget film, needs to expose himself to the incomprehension and disappointment of critics, who are, though it's not often said, more of a threat to progress than the masses. Miike must find their disappointment, like that of the sadistic fanboys, proof that his quest is a true one.'\n",

The premise is awfully teenybopper: a strange voicemail message on your cell phone tells you when you will die. Somehow I felt like this must have been done before. But not like this guy did it...It takes a lot to creep my out and Takashi Miike managed to do it pretty well in the final twenty minutes of this movie. The setting becomes extremely scary and the jumpouts are not typical; they don't really build up, they just seem to come out of nowhere.My only complaint with this film is that it never really ties itself up into a neat little package in the end; it's a little convoluted as to why certain people are connected to the original death. Without giving anything up, I'll just say that I was a bit perplexed.I have to ask: who thinks it's a smart idea to keep remaking these awesome Asian horror flicks and dumbing them down with Americanized garbage? Are we really that lazy that we can't read subtitles? And if so, why not just watch the dubbed version? I just don't get it! \"One Missed Call\" is one that should not be missed by horror buffs.

            "Review: 'Even fans of Takashi Miike (I'm one) should be honest. He's made some bravura masterpieces like Audition and 13 Assassins but he's also churned out a lot of overlong, incoherent stinkers, of which this is one.The premise - that people receive cell phone messages from their future selves recorded just before the moment of their deaths - had a lot of potential but Miike spaffs all that up the wall by drowning the film in slow, boring exposition and skimping on the many inventive and creepy deaths this film should have contained.The biggest problem here is that the backstory behind why all this is happening is uninteresting and revealed in tedious chunks throughout. Instead of making the main events in the present scarier they actually make them seem more mundane. There's also a lack of clarity around how and why these events can be stopped.Another thing that bugged me was characters behaving irrationally. The victims heard their own words recorded at the moments of their future deaths but didn't appear to make any concerted effort not to robotically repeat those same words when the time came. You'd think that it might occur to them that to be in a hotel room or a cop shop at the predicted instant of their death while definitely not uttering the words on the premonitory recording might keep them safe. But no. No one tries this and they all shamble into the jaws of doom like the pathetic, suicidal sheep they are.This could have been a great film but it was an opportunity badly missed. Still there's plenty of other Miike to check out. It's not like the man hasn't given us anything else to choose from.'\n",

            "Review: 'This just might be the most interesting psychological drama that I've seen since Miike's own masterpiece Audition (1999), and one that it seems has sadly been misinterpreted by many critics and viewers as being a work of simple J-Horror by numbers. Though it has elements of this, the characteristics of J-Horror, which are very much rooted in standard social and spiritual taboos that many Japanese people take incredibly seriously, are used as window dressing here, intended to distract the audience from the more important and subtle ideas at work behind the surface of the narrative.It certainly isn't a pastiche or a spoof as some viewers have indicated, though you could argue that it works on a certain satirical level, with the odd hint of benign humour that we've come to expect from Miike woven throughout. However, judging from much of the stylistic tone of the film, with its deeper allusions to child abuse and the murky and alienated tone that the director attaches to it, I honestly can't imagine that this is meant to be laughed at. Those who claim that the film is a comedy or a spoof are more likely to be Miike fans that are unfamiliar with the broader aspects of his work and the way in which he puts his films together; instead judging his films simply on the shock-value and tongue-in-cheek triviality of projects like Ichi the Killer (2002) and Dead or Alive (1999). Yes, he does accept any film that is offered to him, and more often than not chooses work that he feels he can do something interesting with; experimenting with the form and content and occasionally adding his own touches that are often subversive and somewhat attention seeking, but he always has in mind an approach that best suits the material.He doesn't condescend to his work; there's no cynicism here. As ever, Miike is fulfilling the wishes of his producer whilst simultaneously bringing something else to the film that may have been missed by a lesser filmmaker, more interested in the superficial quality of the story. In this case, a sly comment on the media and how it manipulates tragedy for profit; turning horror and pain into spectacle. It also continues the theme of lost youth; something quite prevalent in Japanese cinema, with films like Battle Royale (2000), Visitor Q (2001), Pulse (2001) and All About Lily Chou-Chou (2002) documenting the recent struggles in both social environments and education, with the idea of a generation of Japanese youth overwhelmed by expectations of family and society and cast adrift in such a way as to leave them ultimately more venerable to a greater evil (be it drugs, gang violence, suicide or crime). It's all done metaphorically of course - with the J-horror elements used to mask these ideas - though certainly, in many of the scenes, we see characters, kids even, isolated and with no one to turn to.Think about the presentation of both the film and the narrative; the absence of responsible adults creating a ghost world that these kids drift in and out of, turning only to each other for solace. The creation of a nocturnal world where school children hang out on railway bridges in the early hours of the morning, watching scenes of abject horror in a way that suggests tragic familiarity. The way that the background characters - the everyday people on the street - huddle under umbrellas watching a televised exorcism in the centre of Shinjuku completely cut off and detached from everything that is happening, becoming an almost representation of the audience even; eating up the pain and suffering as dismissible entertainment and completely missing the personal horror and exploitation of the abuse itself. Likewise, look at the scenes shot during the day. The streets are mostly empty, save for the presence of the adult media, the police (who have a complicated role within the film) and the students who are at the centre of the whole thing.Those claiming that this is a comedy seem uneducated when it comes to Miike and his work; looking for the vapid cartoon character and his torrents of gore and depraved sex, and not the finely nuanced filmmaker who gave us excellent, multi-layered works like Shinjuku Triad Society (1995), Rainy Dog (1997), The Bird People in China (1998), Audition (1999), Dead or Alive: Birds (2000) and Gozu (2003). As a horror film, this is effective. The scenes in the abandoned hospital, although clichéd, work incredibly well at ramping the tension. However, there's more to the film once we dig beneath the surface. The final act of the film takes place on at least three different levels; taking in the real, the imagined and the abstracted memory of both. The way Miike brings the various elements together - using stylised production design and skewed perspectives - creates a hall of mirrors like sense of abstraction familiar from the final act of Audition. Think about it. Is Gozu simply an absurd spoof on the latent homosexuality of the Yakuza sub-genre, or is there a more interest sub-textual argument about identity and gender being woven within? One Missed Call works on a similar level.Those who make the effort to watch Miike's work will know that there is always much more to his films than it initially seems, though you really have to work at it. To suggest that this is a spoof because you fail to appreciate the subtle, sub-textual storytelling and ask simply for mere cartoon-like abstraction is a discredit to a great filmmaker and those of us familiar with Miike's work beyond that of Ichi the Killer. With One Missed Call, Miike gives us a multi-layered film; shocking and satirical in equal measures and tied to a truly tragic depiction of loss, abuse and alienated youth.'\n",

Takashi shows he knows a lot about filming methods, and also gives us an overview of the Japanese craziness about mobile phones : I can assure you that you will never look again the same way at your phone after seeing such a movie.For the ones who have seen other Japanese horror movies, I would advise it as well, as you enjoy seeing again the same old tricks in a different context...and it works again !So if you have the chance to have this one in a nearby theater...just try it !!'\n",

It's 2000, the same year that Ju-On was premiered on TV. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Takashi Miike invented this spooky technology genre, but the evil spirit/ghost in the machine in MPD Psycho originally moved from host to host via mobile phone and internet connection. Maybe Miike was influenced by Joe Dante's electrical Gremlin, or Wes Craven's Shocker. Only he would know. Whatever the reality, One Missed Call, plays out like MPD Psycho episode seven, shot on film instead of digital video, so it looks darker, less jokey, and consequently, more professional. The ring-tone even has an air of eerie familiarity about it. As an oblique footnote to the MPD series, it's pretty good. As a moody grudge movie in its own right, it punches well above its weight.'\n",

In JU-ON: THE GRUDGE, the curse existed within a building; in RING, it passed on via a ringing telephone; in ONE MISSED CALL it takes the form of a mobile telephone call and voicemail message, with a time-travel twist. The one thing immediately noticeable is that this film's director is shock king Takashi Miike, he of ICHI THE KILLER notoriety amongst others, but he keeps his outrageous gore and violence to a minimum here. Apart from a couple of jumpily-edited scares and two or three gruesome moments (the beheading/de-arming being the \"highlight\") his work here is indistinguishable from many other directors. However, he does a decent job with the creepy atmosphere and the tension is spot on.Visually, this film is recognisable as being a RING derivative, as with so many others. The ghost is of a grey-skinned woman with long dark hair who we catch brief, creepy glimpses of throughout. There's a stand-out shock scene involving an approaching ghost towards the climax, and lots of young, pretty Japanese actresses screaming their heads off in terror. However, there are a few things here that are more original than most, including a chirpy mobile ring tone that quickly becomes scary because it symbolises death; plus the appearance of a rotting zombie towards the film's climax which is pretty gruesome. Shibasaki makes for an able lead and proves to be another talented young actress while the supporting cast never step out of line. My only real complaint with ONE MISSED CALL is the head-scratching ending, which piles on twist after twist and ends up leaving you totally confused about what just happened – opaque isn't the word. Still, for fans of subtle, scary old-fashioned chills, you could do a lot worse than this one...'\n",

            "Review: '\"One Missed Call\" is an intense and surprisingly splatter-free thriller by Takashi Miike, creator of frenzy flicks such as \"Ichi  The Killer\" and \"MPD Psycho\". The film is involving and compelling right from the first minutes, as it introduces a group of identifiable young friends. Whilst in the bathroom, a girl's cell phone rings but she can't answer. The voice mail shows that the call came from her own number and from a date in the near future! When listening to the actual voice mail, the message seems to carry the girl's last words and a disturbingly realistic recording of her deadfall. This mysteriously supernatural ritual repeats itself several times and each time the recipient actually dies on the predestined time! More than enough reason to freak out, if you ask me! A teenage girl and the brother of a deceased girl start to investigate the case and discover that everything relates to the strange Mizunuma family. Okay, I admit that this film's premise sounds an awful lot like \"Ringu\" (even including the whole family-mystery), but I liked \"One Missed Call\" so much better than that dull and overrated \"classic\". Miike's characters are more convincing, the death-sequences are far more spine-chilling and at least the set-pieces are up-to-date! Japan is THE country of brand new technology and this finally is a movie that uses it! No dusty videotapes here, but fancy cell phones and live television shows that exploit urban legends! The story does get confusing at times (especially near the ending) and some of the overlong dialogue could easily have been cut. The biggest trumps are some small details that make this movie almost unbearably scary, like the petrifying ring tone that is used repeatedly and the wild camera-work during the TV-show sequence. Recommended! Better watch it before the American remake ruins it again.'\n",

Yoko missed the call but a voice message was left, the strange message is dated the 18th April which is two days away & came from her own mobile number. Then two days later on the 18th Yoko dies in a mysterious accident, after that her friend Kenji Kawai (Atsushi Ida) receives a similar call & he too dies in mysterious circumstances shortly after.

I suppose it had to happen, since mobile phones have become such an integral part of modern culture it was inevitable someone was going to make a horror film based around them & you know even evil killer ghost's have to keep up with the times & use mobile phones. The basic concept to me seems laughable as Chakushin Ari tries to make something as common & everyday as a mobile phone call scary & for me it fails totally. I'm sorry but seeing a mobile phone rings just isn't scary or a concept that sends shivers down my spine, that's basically what it boils down to & a big reason why I found Chakushin Ari so dull, lifeless & such a chore to sit through. The script by Minako Daira was based on a novel by Yasushi Akimoto & is throughly slow going, I found the whole story revolving around some sort of ghost who was wronged in someway when they were alive & wanting some sort of revenge old hat & the Japanese have flogged the idea to death & usually with considerably more success than Chakushin Ari. Then there's the ending, it's absolutely terrible & doesn't really make any sort of sense although maybe it's lost in the English translation. The ending is a complete mess that seems to have time travel, possession, ghost's & no sort of closure. The one thing I did learn from this film though is if a rotten zombie is walking towards you with the intent to kill you then hug it & say nice things to it, it'll work a treat.Director Miike is usually known for his more outrageous & gory films but here with Chakushin Ari he really tones it down, there's certainly no blood or gore or violence expect for a severed arm. To be honest there's nothing here we haven't seen loads of times before, there's the obligatory female ghost who walks funny & makes strange noises that every Japanese supernatural horror film must include. Been there, done it & brought the T-shirt. Things pick up a bit towards the end with a haunted hospital but it's never really revealed why the hospital is haunted or how a woman's dead body got there or how it's mobile phone battery hasn't run out in six months. Like most of these Japanese ghost films Chakushin Ari is filmed in muted colours & in a very simple sort of way, it just looks bland & forgettable although maybe that was the intention.Technically the film is alright, there's nothing here that's going to amaze anyone but it's reasonably well made for what it is. I must admit I really don't like subtitled films, I just find them a chore to watch & very distracting. The acting seems alright but since we never know what anyone is saying it's difficult to judge.Chakushin Ari is a tedious film that I really didn't enjoy at all, I found it a throughly boring mess with a less than inspiring central premise that were mostly rehashes of other similar films. The film proved popular enough to spawn two sequels Chakushin Ari 2 (2005), Chakushin Ari Final (2006) as well as a Japanese TV series & a Hollywood remake.'\n",

            "Review: ''One Missed Call (2003)' is, essentially, an amalgamation of 'Ring (1998)', 'Dark Water (2002)', 'Pulse (2001)' and 'Ju-On: The Curse (2000)'. It takes all the classic tropes of J-horror and distils them into a single, somewhat derivative experience. However, it isn't just an attempt to cash in on the popularity of its genre; it's an accomplished and entertaining horror film in its own right. The flick follows a young woman whose friends begin receiving missed calls, seemingly from their future selves, which accurately foretell their deaths. She teams up with the brother of a recent victim and the pair attempt to stop the curse before it's too late. If it sounds familiar, that's because it is (as I mentioned earlier). What really sets it apart from its peers, though, is its execution. The picture has several genuinely arresting set-pieces and is generally rather creepy throughout. Its finale, set inside an abandoned hospital, is nothing short of fantastic. It's exciting and scary in equal measure. Unfortunately, the movie is one or two scenes too long. Its climax sort of trips over itself, ultimately ending on a sort of frustratingly ambiguous and perhaps tonally inconsistent note. The middle act is also rather slow. Still, the picture is a solid entry in its genre despite these issues. It's really effective overall. It may seem like a bit of a copycat, but it has value of its own and it's certainly worth watching. 7/10.'\n",

As the time that each message arrives, the recipient is killed by a malevolent entity seeking retribution for their death.One Missed Call is one of a spate of Japanese horror films (commonly known as J-Horror) that came out in the late 1990s / early 2000s. The genre was kicked off by Hideo Nakata's ridiculously successful RING, which set up the clichés that all the other films, including this one, follow almost to the letter.As far as horror films go, this particular one is nothing special. In some respects, it is a bit of a disappointment, mainly due to the fact that its director, Takeshi Miike, is capable of making some really individualistic films that can be fairly compared to the works of Shinya Tsukamoto. One Missed Call follows the Ring formula almost to the letter – there is a technologically-minded curse (in this case cell phones) where the owner of the device is given a warning & a deadline before they are killed. To be fair, Ring was not that good a film, but it did have an atmosphere that was creepy & unearthly. This film doesn't even have that, not to mention the fact that, at nearly two hours long, it overstays its welcome. There is the occasional moment which suggests a work of promise – one of the victims meets her fate in a television studio – but for all intensive purposes, One Missed Call is dead on arrival.The execs at Hollywood conducted a remake some years later, which was actually quite better than this original.'\n",

            "Review: 'This Japanese horror film - directed by Takashi Miike (Ichi the Killer, Dead or Alive, The Happiness of the Katakuris and a few other movies that will either upset you or make you happy) and written by Minako Daira (who wrote all three films in the series) - is all about a psychology student named Yumi Nakamura (Ko Shibasaki, Battle Royale) whose friends begin getting messages from the future that gives the time and date of their deaths. And then - you guessed it - they die. Now, Yumi has received her message.Based on the novel Chakushin Ari by Yasushi Akimoto, this movie was remade in that mid-2000's time when every single J-horror movie was getting Westernized.Detective Hiroshi Yamashita (Shinichi Tsutsumi, Why Don't You Play In Hell) begins helping Yumi, telling her that she isn't crazy. His sister was one of the early victims, who are all called an hour after each murder and then die at the time and date that the message prophecizes. Then, they spit out a red jawbreaker.Everything points to Mimiko Mizunuma, a girl who died from an asthma attack and whose ailments would indirectly happen to her sister Nanako like some psychic Munchausen syndrome by proxy.There's also a televised exorcism that goes horribly wrong, more possession, stabbings, severed hands clutching cel phones and the kind of twisted imagery that would be beyond the scope of most directors. However, this may be one of Miike's tamest movies. That's not a slight, but he has a tendency to go well beyond the boundaries of sanity. There's also plenty of light and shadow here, along with a Bava-esque blue and red color palette in some scenes.If you enjoy Japanese horror, consider this a greatest hits collection. A ringtone plays music from Miike's Gozu, the idea of the curse itself is from Ringu, the apartment building with a water tank shot is from Dark Water, the idea of ghosts in the machine of modern technology comes from Pulse and The Grudge lends the ghost child imagery.'\n",

            "Review: 'Takashi Miike, in 2003, decided to take on two very different projects, one Gozu, which was maybe the greatest surrealist-yakuza movie ever made, and One Missed Call, a commercial project (or rather, not as 'art-house' or X-rated for the main cineplex theaters, at least in Japan) for teen fans of the 'grudge' type of horror movie. In all fairness in seeing this film, I have not seen many, or even a few, of these kinds of 21st century ghost stories with the ante upped on gore and things that suddenly spring up out of the darkness. This being said, it was an admirable effort from a filmmaker who's still experimenting even when he's making something for the 'kids' (the theatrical trailer shows this, as it advertises for teens and junior high schoolers to come see the movie). The premise is as follows: teenagers start receiving cell phone calls- from themselves. Soon after, they die, based on what is heard of in the voice message of the person saying something, screaming, and that's that. At first it seems like it's just suicides, but Yumi (Kou Shibasaki) thinks something else is up, something much darker. When the secret starts to reveal itself, there's more to the picture than just a simple 'grudge'.There's a family-history element to One Missed Call that Miike properly exploits more in the second half of the film, and it's by this point that it turns into a (properly) ghoulish spectacle. Although Miike does stop for a moment to make a comment on media hoopla over supernatural occurrences with the TV show that turns Yumi and her friend into fodder for 'specialists', including something like a zen-master or something, he's doing nothing more than helming a story of spirits from the dead- and very scorned dead- going back after the living. His main set-piece in a dilapidated warehouse/hospital is maybe the strongest for pure chills, as Yumi goes through the halls and doesn't see the ghost crawling up on the ceiling behind her. There's even an almost tongue-in-cheek, yet tender, scene involving a green corpse who may or may not be Yumi's mother. But aside from this, there are other good moments of the kind of horror that made Audition the classic that it is, and an ending that puts a very bleak twist on the whole story (and a \"it was you all along\" kind of connotation that reeks of being lifted from other movies).It's nothing much of a great horror film though, because despite the possible interest in the more horrific side to the story, the one involving child abuse, is not given much clarity- save for a scene in a classroom- until the last twenty minutes of the movie, where lots of emotion spurred on from the actual cell phone ring tone comes out. This being said, it's a recommendable effort for its main genre fans, a very worthy knock-off that is, oddly enough, soon to be another of the many, many, many other American knock-offs of the Ju-On type craze in Japan. It might have even *better* production design and effects (and for a movie from this director it has quite the nifty lot of both), but I doubt it will have half of the ingenuity of Miike.'\n",

Most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of Reality TV cameras intruding on the future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) are disappointing and dispiriting. The frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly, and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid.

            "Review: 'After her friends start mysteriously dying off, a young woman finds that her friends are being called on their cell-phones broadcasting their death screams from the future through a ghostly curse featuring a thought-dead girl coming back for revenge through technology and races to stop the curse that is wiping them all out.There was some good stuff here when this one tried to. One of the best elements here is the fact brought up here involving the use of technology in modern society which is quite fun here. That the technological importance of the storyline, built around the common everyday use of cell-phones present in their culture with the near death-grip they have on their phones, pagers and other devices they feature, gives off a great sense of the atmosphere going on that then becomes perverted with the intrusion of the ghostly activity. Spreading the message of death they will eventually die through these devices and the ensuing fear it causes in them to panic and contemplate abandoning these devices tells a lot of the impact it has on them. On top of that, the film has a lot to like with the ghostly action and activity present. There's a good element in the film involving the television crew, especially once they're involved in the story due to the novel idea behind it but that it provides some really good stuff to come. One of the best is the outstanding live TV report done on the matter, which is just absolutely outstanding. The exorcism that opens it is exciting and thrilling, and when the ghost appears the chaos of the situation, destruction of the studio in a blinding storm of debris, tossed furniture and general panic is a sight to behold. When the ghost does first appear, it slowly appears from around a corner only to the victim before launching into one of the greatest visually-striking deaths that are just brutal in the situation, and then to have the entire scenario broadcast to the world on live-television just makes the whole scene that much more unnerving. The rest of the encounters with the ghost, from the opening kill on the bridge to the short little plugs seen on TV before the live-interview and the encounter in the abandoned room that is just all sorts of atmospheric, manage to add a little extra dose of tension to the mix as well. These here make the film enjoyable as there were a couple of problems here that hold it down. One of the main ones is that there's a relatively large portion of time in the middle segment where absolutely nothing at all happens. This is mostly the searching for the family that has been at the cause for it all, yet this doesn't at all provide much in the way of anything interesting. The fact that the ghost is missing from these scenes is incredibly apparent, hardly anything scary happens and it seems to become more of a police-procedural drama more than anything else, which is not all that bad since the mystery is at least given some more weight to than most others, but when it takes longer than the amount of screen-time given to it to fully get the idea across in a completely non-confusing matter is when it runs into trouble. That leads to another problem here which is the overly-complicated plot. This here is a case of being over-explained, and in a sense feels like it's got about twenty different ideas crammed into it and then contrivance is written into it to make it somewhat plausible for the events to be connected, and in the end, this whole section is a big loss. The other flaw to the film is that, because of the large number of ideas written into the story, it takes forever for the film to end and none of the events portrayed make any sense at all on their own. The events inside the trapped room are quite lame anyway, making no sense at all and that's before it allows the official ending to come into play, re-writing that and doing anything to correct it either. This one is entirely confusing, and pretty much constitutes the flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language.'\n",

Upon hearing that he delved into supernatural horror ala Ju-On and Ringu I was quite excited. I finally caught this on TV a couple of weeks back and was surprised...and disappointed. Although this holds up very well amongst the recent crop of J-Horror (and American horror), it isn't entirely original and it all felt a bit \"been there, done that.\"Chakusin ari (or One Missed Call) revolves around mobile phones. A group of friends start receiving ominous voice-mails from their future selves. At the time that they die. This starts a chain of odd deaths which causes our main character, Yumi (Kou Shibasaki) to investigate the source of the phone calls with the help of policeman Hiroshi (Shin'ichi Tsutsumi).Miike knows how to create suspense and he proves it here. There are many tense and creepy moments throughout, although the pace does slow down a tad in the middle. The acting is very good from all the actors and the story proceeds in a logical manner (with no plot holes; rare in a ghost movie). Expectedly, the deaths are gruesome and bloody (it IS Miike after all). The ending is typical Miike, confusing, disturbing but original and oddly suited.However, this movie cannot escape the feeling of \"seen it all before.\" The typical long-haired girl scares are the there, along with a couple of \"boo\" scares; so basically it carried a 'Ju-On' feel throughout. As far as J-Horror goes, though, this is a fitting contribution.3½/5'\n",

But I have to admit that I only recalled this movie by it title and the very basic concept of the plot. So as I stumbled upon the movie again here late in 2022, of course I opted to revisit it.Writer Minako Daira churned out a fair enough script here, though it was a movie that was very, very reminiscent of the late 1990s Japanese classic horror movie \"Ringu\" (aka \"The Ring\"), except this movie was about a cursed mobile phone and not a video cassette. However, as I have not read Yasushi Akimoto's novel, upon which writer Minako Daira's script was based, I have no idea how true this movie is to the novel.I have to say that I was mildly entertained by \"Chakushin Ari\". The movie just didn't really differentiate itself all that much from the wave of horror movie that flooded the Japanese cinema back around that time. And I am surprised to see that it was actually Takashi Miike that helmed the direction of \"Chakushin Ari\", and he usually direct some pretty interesting and memorable movies. Oh well, you can't hit a homerun every time, I guess.The acting performances in \"Chakushin Ari\" were adequate. They had a good enough cast ensemble with Ko Shibasaki leading the troupe.Visually then \"Chakushin Ari\" was fair enough. There were some interesting special effects and a memorable death scene or two. But if you're expecting a grand visual tour de force of mutilations and special effects, then you'll be sorely disappointed.Now, what sort of drained the energy from \"Chakushin Ari\" was the dull and monotonous pacing of the narrative. There just simply wasn't enough interesting things happening as the movie trotted on and on, so 112 minutes of runtime felt rather long and slow.My rating of Takashi Miike's 2003 horror movie \"Chakushin Ari\" lands on a five out of ten stars.'\n",

The vengeful ghost this time finds you through your cellular (good thing I don't have one). Imagine receiving a voice mail from your future self at the moment of death. You've got 48 hours from hearing that message until you meet a horrible end. It's definitely not your typical Takashi Miike film as this was, overall, a fairly tame film. Is Miike going mainstream, or spoofing it here? There seems to be some debate on this point. I think this topic exists because there is no signature Miike craziness going on here. It's, for the most part, a straight-forward J-horror tale in the vein of The Ring or Dark Water. It actually feels more like a Nakata film than a Miike film. But it would not be one of Nakata's better films if he had directed it. Even though there are some unsettling moments, the pace drags and it has a very unsatisfying ending. Did it really need to be 2 hours long? I think they could have cut that whole silly public exorcism scene and tightened up the plot. Because some things don't add up, or I'm not taking the time to make them add up as I would normally do. But what do I know? There are three of these films, a U.S. remake, and a television series. My opinion is definitely in the minority.'\n",

            "Review: 'By all the fawning people have been doing over Miike and his work. I sat through this flick tonight. I figured, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I assumed from these comments it might be, then it will be worth my time.No such luck.I'm all for finding the next great director (or writer), but I don't think Miike is the one. I don't have an NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I do know this much: a horror movie has to have pacing. It also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does.This film's pacing had me shaking my head. Some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and lingered there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end, eyes wide and mouth agape. A famous director once made the claim, and I'm paraphrasing, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll. Kou is not a good enough actress to make that work. She stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than I care to remember. And she isn't the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time.I like Asian cinema. Hong Kong action flicks from the last 30 years, Korean horror like \"Phone\" and \"Koma\", Ang Lee's work, some of the trashy but fun Filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting, as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could have done without.'\n",

            "Review: 'One Missed Call is known as somewhat of a cult classic within the west. There's that remake we don't talk about much that people watched once and then went to watch this original. Thankfully, I managed to skip the White remake and got to watch the original without having the bad taste of remake in my mouth first. I'm glad I managed to watch this one first - and probably definitely won't watch the remakes. One Missed Call is probably the medium that started that old email chain mail - remember how paranoid you used to get recieving an email saying if you don't pass it on to so many people some scary thing will kill you during your sleep? Welp, if that terrified you, you probably want to stay away from this movie. Meanwhile if paranoia creeping down your spine everytime you hear your phone ring or vibrate is something you want, then watch on. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting from this movie. I knew the general premise and at first, it seemed more like Final Destination than anything else. It's not really until the third character that anything really starts to happen, and things get spooky. Maybe I'm more desensitised to horror than I originally thought. The music didn't do me justice personally, nor the acting; none of these actually scared me. It wasn't until we see the things happening that things got scary for me. That was more all down to the darkness effect used for me, more than anything. I think if I hadn't seen as much horror that uses the same effects, I would have been more scared by this and more on edge. \n",
            "There were two different plot lines occuring nearer the end and it got quite confusing for me to figure out what was going on between all the characters. There was a lot happening, and I think the second plot line could have been dropped or made much simpler. I probably wouldn't rewatch this. Maybe once if I don't watch the sequel/s until further into the future and I want to remind myself what happened in the first; that would be the only reason. The ending for the first film alone ends it all very well, and doesn't leave much room for another movie; I'm not sure if I'm excited to see where they'd take a second movie, or if I want to leave it rounded off as it was. Overall, this does have a good scare factor. It's enjoyable, the plot is well enough that you can sit through it without being bored even if it's not scary to you. It's a good movie if you haven't seen it, and I definitely recommend it.'\n",

            "Review: 'Yumi's friends are dying in bizarre ways to what seems to be a supernatural vengeful ghost who forewarns her prey by sending them a ring-tone playing a specific tune. Following that tune is the final words spoken from each chosen victim's mouth before they die. On their phones, is a set date and time in the future when they will perish. Yumi(Kou Shibasaki)joins forces with Hiroshi Yamashita(Shin'ichi Tsutsumi), whose sister was a chosen victim who died from terrible burns. Their journey to find out who is responsible for the abnormal murdering spree leads to a family with possible abuse involved. There's an important sub-plot featuring Yumi's harsh up-bringing that might be an essential aspect in the grand scheme of things. One major question is obvious..why are these certain victims chosen? Why would a ghost go out of her way to kill these people randomly?The film seems like a standard, modern Asian horror flick using technology as a means for ghouls to travel so they can inflict bodily harm to their chosen victims, if you go by the premise alone. But, Miike does get a chance to imbue his warped sense of humor within the plot as Yumi's final college chum, Natsumi(Kazue Fukiishi)is exploited by a television show for ratings as the world watches with bated breath if she'll die in the studio across the airwaves as a monk tries to exorcise her from the monster pursuing her. And, the final thirty minutes toys with us as it shifts from one proposed ending to another. To be honest, the supposed climax in the old abandoned hospital, quite darkly lit, where we think Yumi is finally encountering the ghostly killer claiming her life is next, is solidly eerie. I think, for the most part, this is a professionally made, well-executed, slow-burn creeper. Rather level-headed(..but, still with quite a few WTF? sequences to keep us on our toes), if a bit overlong. I think there's a good 90 minute movie here, but I do still think it's worthwhile even it's not Miike at his best. I'm afraid, this film's air of familiarity will hurt it somewhat.'\n",

The premise seems simple, but the film itself is shockingly decent. The film not only includes pleasantly violent scenes, but it also includes shocking story and character development. However, by the release of this film, the misunderstood ghost story has been a bit stale, and the runtime is a little too long. However, One Missed Call improves on several other J-horror films in that time in various ways.'\n",

            "Review: 'If John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween was a metaphorical and unsubtle morality tale on celibacy, does this make Takashi Miike's 2003 film One Missed Call a metaphorical and unsubtle tale on popularity? If you had sex in Halloween you were sliced and diced; if you own a mobile phone in this ever growing post-modern world of gadgets and modernity as well as being really popular, in One Missed Call you're arguably in even bigger trouble. But then again even I'm not sure if being stalked by Michael Myers is as scary or indeed scarier than being hunted by a supernatural ghost-like being. There is one thing for sure though, One Missed Call takes its idea and its feint ideas on the ever increasing demand for popularity and somewhat makes a hash of it.I suppose there is no surprise that the Japanese would produce a film such as this one. The general feel I think is that the Japanese are consistently producing the best horror films that the world is currently seeing and even when it's not Japan such as 2003's The Eye, it is still that Far Easterly Asia influence that makes them better than American or indeed European films in the genre. But One Missed Call is just one missed opportunity. With its premise revolving around a slice of technology that spawns greater fears (video tape in The Ring/laser eye technology in The Eye), One Missed Call feels a little dated right from the beginning. Usually the film will rely on daft logic from its characters and implausible situations to get across the bulk of its scares.The idea behind the film reads something along the lines of a mysterious caller trying to contact various people. When these people fail to answer their phones they have a missed call and these voice messages are their grizzly fates. It sounds interesting and like a compelling detective idea but the film dumbs down its premise by presenting the women within the film as weak; one-dimensional; squealing; screaming; inferior people who all share the common characterisations of being abused and the victims in general. Compare this to the male characters who have sad back-stories; are brave, strong and toward the end closely resemble a mythical knight in shining armour as the final acts plays out in a hospital. The men in the film are also authority figures with the few incidences of police presence all being of the male variety.But until these gender issues have arrived, the characters (usually the women) are given really embarrassing actions to carry out. Yumi (Shibasaki) is the protagonist of the film and the one who must find out what's going on before she herself comes to harm. In The Ring and The Eye, similar female heroines took on supernatural missions in order to save themselves and future people. Here, Yumi can only squeal, cry and put her hands over her eyes when faced with danger as the false-hero Hiroshi (Tsutsumi) comes to save her. Hiroshi is also given a prior tragedy; his sister succumbed to the missed call curse and he's in on figuring it all out purely out of spite. For him it is a revenge mission and we feel more for him because of this, thus taking away the focus and emphasis from Yumi.The final showdown in hospital makes for some interesting reading. Watch it and ask yourself \"Who actually does what?\" Yumi can only cry, stare and crawl around when faced with the film's antagonist and yet there is more at stake for her as it's her life on the line  Hiroshi is there purely for payback but it is him with the weapon and it is he who must fight the monster. Even getting to the hospital is an ordeal. Yumi figures out one thing or another and goes there all alone, at night, poking around. I'm all for scares and thrills, that's why we actively watch horror films but when the motivation for the scares come at such a disappointing and dumbed down level, it is then difficult to 'feel' for the people in the film as it was their own stupidity that got them there in the first place.So this really just acts as a set up to get the male saviour of the film to finish the story off. Getting to the final act is equally as silly. When someone's possession phenomenon is revealed earlier on, everyone's first reaction is to bung her on a TV show and have her exorcised live. This could be a statement on how Japan these days make a media circus out of anything but I'm not in touch enough with the culture to know this for sure. Needless to say that by the time the ghost appears, the entire studio has run away and left the female victim by herself  where were the security guards that were so desperate not to let Hiroshi and Yumi into the studio? Why are there no cautionary backups? Why does the girl just stay there and let it 'get' her? Because she's a female and it acts as a 'scary' scene, I suppose.One Missed Call plods along with its meek ideation about how phones and technology and popularity are maybe dangerous, but it never makes any serious stand. The film is a series of ill-motivated, uninteresting scenes that do not scare so much as they frustrate. By the time the showdown with the monster has arrived, you expect Yumi to be fighting for her life with it right in front of her alá The Ring, The Eye or even an American film like The Terminator or Alien, but she doesn't even seem interested. Not a great venture into the Far Easterly horror territory.'\n",

Various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed, so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I've been more impressed with his low key works like City of Lost Souls, however as One Missed Call plodded along I was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of Dead or Alive or the overly pseudo-Cronenberg style of Audition. Despite a lot of his films being essentially empty, at least they do have merits such as these, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating Johnny Depp. There's none of that in One Missed Call; there's just very little of credit: the acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of scares or suspense, and in places it's just downright boring.However, there are moments where Miike's glacier-like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism; most notably with the instance of the TV show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life. But aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is Miike behind the camera; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One Missed Call isn't offensively bad. It's just frustratingly average.Miike obviously loves directing. With his huge yearly output it's obvious he isn't going to be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with this in mind, One Missed Call felt like he was just paying the bills.'\n",

Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the ending is confusing: it makes no sense at all. As for the ring-tone: Miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing. Even though it was played a dozen times I can't even remember it - that's how scary it was. Speaking of Miike, for him this is something of a commercial venture, so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the \"Bijita Q\" or \"Audition\" kind, they're wasting their time.'\n",

If I've seen one Asian film that revolves around a pale-skinned, long black-haired female ghost, I feel as if I've seen a dozen. Whether One Missed Call is derivative of other Asian horror films or whether it's the other way around, I don't know (or really care). The similarities, though, are undeniable. But it hardly matters when it comes to enjoying the movie. Miike has put together an entertaining and at times frightening tale of a young girl seeking retribution for her death. It's far less bloody and over-the-top than most of Miike's other films, but for the most part, it works. Miike is much more restrained and relies on very subtle moments to create unease in the viewer. One of the best examples is the \"ghost in the cupboard\" scene. It's a simple moment without a lot of fanfare, but it's very effective in generating the desired response. Other highlights of the film include the death scene at the television studio and the search through the abandoned hospital. These moments help Miike's film standout from the crowded field of similarly themed J-horror films.Whether the plots of these J-horror ghost stories appeal to you or not, as usual, it's difficult to deny the level of artistry and technical brilliance that goes into these films. One Missed Call is no exception. Thanks to some interesting cinematography and lighting, the film has a \"look\" that helps create an atmosphere of dread. The special effects, both visual and sound, are well done. The acting is good. Both of the leads, Kou Shibasaki and Shin'ichi Tsutsumi, are more than adequate. And Miike's direction expertly creates the desired tension. Overall, it's the kind of well-made Asian horror film that I've come to expect.But One Missed Call isn't without its faults. Beyond the \"been there, done that\" aspects of the plot, the film's pacing could have been better. While the first and third acts are enjoyable, the middle portion of the One Missed Call tends to drag a bit. Some of the investigation scenes into what's behind the mystery put a halt to what is an otherwise well paced film. A little judicious editing might have helped the film flow better. One Missed Call also includes a number of plot points that are never adequately resolved. For example, why was the mother's dead body in the abandoned hospital? And could the ending have been more confusing? I admit that I'm completely at a loss to explain the films finale. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, but don't ask me what it all meant. Maybe a second viewing is necessary to resolve some of these issues.'\n",

If there is one thing that I believe it is that the Japanese are the kings of horror movies. They just do creepy very well. One of my favourite scenes is in a TV studio when one of the girls is getting an excorsism, which of course goes wrong and she tears down a flag covering thing revealing a wall section with a gap in it into which our friendly ghost appears. That, for me, was very well done. It was this image of the ghost that had been sent to the girls cell phone, a bit like sadako coming out the well in Ring, and it was truly awesome. If you like Japanese horror movies like I do then you should really like this movie. The atmosphere is good, the acting is superb and the plot is decent. That is why I give this movie a 9/10.

Because there's no other way to really describe this film without comparing it to numerous others that came before.The story of \"One Missed Call\" is essentially just a cocktail comprised of two-parts \"Ringu/Ring\" to one-part \"Ju-On: The Curse\"... garnished with a dash of the visuals and tonality of the first couple \"Tomie\" flicks here and there for good measure. Oh, and a pinch of a handful of director Takashi Miike's previous films once or twice during particularly \"gooey\" scenes.Yes, yes, yes... I know it's based on a novel and that it's fair to say many Japanese horror films (Heck, I'd say Asian horror films in general) share a lot of common visuals, story structure and occasionally specific scenes. But at the same time, it's hard not to notice how much the movie does rely on borrowing materials we've generally seen done much better before, while just giving them a slight cosmetic face-lift.Stop me if you've heard this one: A small group of friends must fight for their lives after receiving phonecalls alerting them that they will die in just a few days. (...never heard that one before. Oh, wait...) Except instead of relying on a cursed video-tape, the dark forces at play in this film skip right to the nitty-gritty as the curse is just focused on the phone-call itself. You get the call, you die, someone else close to you gets the next call. And so, the search is on as young Yumi- who has lost several friends to the curse and appears to be its next victim- must team up with investigating detective Yamashita to solve the mystery of what's happening and how to stop it.I will make a minor apology for the use of sarcasm above, but I can't blame myself too much. It's just too hard to really talk about this film without addressing those obvious similarities that it has to other films. Really the only thing that sort-of sets this film apart from being just another generic horror-flick are some wonderfully subversive little scenes that pop up now and again and a few big stand-out scares thanks to the skill of director Miike. That and admittedly fun performances from our leads Kou Shibasaki and Shinichi Tsutsumi, who are both able to salvage some fine work despite a painfully derivative script and clichéd character development.One particularly remarkable scene relatively early in the film is what pulls it all together for me, and makes me able to forgive the film's faults and shortcomings. While I won't spoil the outcome, I will say it revolves around a character desperately trying to survive, even going so far as to appear on live-TV for an \"exorcism\" to save her from whatever dark force is at play. Not only does the scene contain some nice and very subtle bits of satire, but it's also just REALLY darned creepy and unsettling, building tension like a tightening wire until it all snaps and goes completely nuts. It's about a 10 minute sequence, but it packs more suspense, fear and even small chuckles than most films do in their entire runtime. It's frankly shocking just how amazingly effective this scene is compared to the relatively by-the-numbers rest of the proceedings. Another sequence set in a hospital later does come close with some truly twisted imagery and visual direction that just drips and oozes pure, dread-filled atmosphere... though it never quite matches the sheer power and ferocity of that earlier sequence. Still, it's another great sequence in its own right and should be mentioned as another of the film's stand-out moments.And honestly, it is scenes like those two that do make this a worthwhile sit... at least for hardcore horror fans or movie-buffs with a taste for Asian films. It's most definitely a case of \"the parts being greater than the whole\", but even still, the whole isn't too bad. It's just very routine. We've seen it all before. But that doesn't mean there's not still some fun to be had with it. It may not be one of Takashi Miike's best efforts. But it's one I think most people will get a kick (and a jump) out of.I give \"One Missed Call\" a slightly above average 6 out of 10. It's worth checking out at least once thanks to some great key scenes... just don't expect a particularly original story. And be prepared to roll your eyes once or twice.'\n",

The newly released CHAKUSHIN ARI (You Have a Message/Call) is yet another leap into the world of Japanese ghost-horror.The story begins innocently enough, as Yumi an her friends exchange cell phone numbers with a new friend at a restaurant.  Shortly after, as Yumi waits in the bathroom for her friend, her friend's cell phone rings, but to the girl's surprise, with an unknown ring tone.  Upon checking the message, the friend hears her own voice, though the meaning is confusing, if not cryptic.  To make matters worse, the message is dated 2 days after...  The cycle begins...Much like RING, CHAKUSHIN ARI's story rests heavily on the notion of an inescapable, and horrible, cycle of events.  Is it terribly original?  No. Is is scary?  I thought so, especially during the final stretch.  With the help of mentally off centre director Takashi Miike, and actors Kou Shibasaki and Shinichi Tsutsumi, CHAKUSHIN ARI is another solid entry for the fans of Japanese ghost-horror.Hope you enjoy it...**SPOILER (Highlight)**:\n",

            "Review: 'I listened to this film purely to study its dialogue as an exercise in my Japanese language studies (a hobby). I was somewhat edgy, expecting my dictionary to be scared out of my hands at any moment. Instead, I encountered nothing very startling, but found that the film developed a good sense of student ambiance, and the horror elements were carefully stylistic - use of shadows, characters unseen by our heroine lurking in backgrounds, subtle bridging to more sinister music to suggest dangers ahead.Then, still early on in the film, I awoke to comic elements - the serial use of gimmickry from other horror flicks. I haven't seen many, but the references to \"The Birds\" and (rather obliquely) to \"Psycho\" were obvious, as was the straining facial indentation on a door a la Ghostbusters - and parodies aside, the classroom scene with the heroine fiddling with her cellphone while the teacher lectures is comic enough. In fact, the exaggerated omnipresence of the cellphones, wherever our characters turn, makes them seem to flock around as comically as though they were Hitchcock's birds.I'll admit I can't think of \"The Birds\" without imagining myself with a baseball bat whacking the poor attackers as they swoop in - something of course the characters themselves couldn't be permitted to do. And in this flick, the all too obvious mystery for the viewer is \"how the director and script writer can possibly explain to us how cellphones can attack and kill...\" It's a great joke! Well, given the level of absurdity, the denouement was bound to be messy. Personally, as I watched and replayed lines and looked up words and phrases, I gradually expected an \"Alice\"-like ending - in the style of American McGee's Alice, the fantastic PC game - i.e., our girl would wake up from her nightmares, freed from inner anguishes, and we'd learn no one but her inner demons had actually died.Well, that's not quite the ending, but for those who're interested in this genre, I'll not spoil it. All in all, it wasn't bad - pretty well made - and as said, I found myself interested in some of the characters.'\n",

The tone is pretty low key which sets a nice contrast for some interesting kill sequences.

            "Review: 'Through the many reviews I've read on this movie it seems the main disappointment was the fact that Takashi Miike went too \"normal\" with it. I guess that the majority of viewers felt the movie was too similar to every other ghost movie via Juon, The Ring, and Dark Water. And that Miike's bizarre fashion and unique touches weren't as present in One Missed Call as in his other films like Ichii, Fudoh, Dead or Alive, or Gozu. I completely disagree. There was actually a LOT of Miike moments in this film. And in his regular fashion we are treated to an unique and bizarre conclusion that thats both disturbing and surprising. If you want to have a clearer picture of what to expect from One Missed Call, think of Juon: The Grudge mixed with the weirdness of Gozu, add a dash of Uzumaki (not a Miike film I know) and the pacing of Audition, and random spots of grotesque images and you have a basic idea of the tone the movie holds. It's misleading at first in making you think it's just going to be another clone of the Phone or The Ring but Miike then pulls you from those tracks and twists everything about.I also think you need to have a sense of not taking it too seriously to truly enjoy the film. A lot of the events which occur are far out there and over the top at times. The weirdness of some of the deaths is almost humorous at times and I think Miike was just trying to have a good time with this one and give his audience a few cheap thrills. It's actually really enjoyable if you sit through it with an open mind and suspension of belief.And whatever you do, DO NOT TRY TO COMPARE IT TO OTHER Asian GHOST MOVIES. You'll ruin it for yourself and really, though the basic idea is comparable to many prior ghost films Miike manages to keep things original and retain his wicked sense of humor and bizarre style.One Missed Call is great. Its definitely not a masterpiece in Asian horror cinema but Miike's addition to the dark-haired-female-killer-ghost fad is exciting, humorous, creepy, weird, energetic, and unique. Give it a chance, don't expect too much, and just go with it.'\n",

The next day, Yumi hears a group of students talking about the story where people are mysteriously receiving phone calls with the exact date and time of their death. a couple of days later at the exact hour, Yoko is attacked by a supernatural force in a train station, while she is talking to her friend Yumi Nakamura.

I think most viewers completely missed the social commentaries in this film about traditional Japanese culture vs. the rise of technology and westernization. Maybe I am over analytical, but I thought this film was about a lot more than just horror. (POSSIBLE SPOILER) I point to the scene when Natsumi is on the television program specifically. The filmography and cuts here are amazing, and I also loved the contrast of the exploitation of the event, with the detective, the priest, and those who really do see this as supernatural and as a reflection of traditional Japanese folklore and ghost stories.I love horror, and J-horror, but with the exception of the traditional Japanese portrayal of a ghost, I didn't really think of this as J-horror. I think it's more a social commentary, under the mask of a horror film, on the contradicting feelings of \"gut\" reactions and belief in traditional folk tales vs. the modern era, the ideas of logic and reason over superstition, and westernization.(POSSIBLE SPOILER)For instance, when talking to the nurse about \"Munchausen by Proxy,\" I love the contrast of this \"logical\" \"psychological modern approach vs. the scenes of the true abuse, and with traditional legends. Like I said, I might be over analyzing the film, but I honestly don't think I am, because Takeshi Miike is NOT A TYPICAL J-HORROR DIRECTOR. This is obviously more related to J-horror than his other films, due to the use of superstition and the traditional long haired, pale ghost, but that is culturally significant, and if you can view this film with these ideas in mind, and with a basic understanding of Japanese history and culture, it's a different experience'\n",

One Missed Call was just as boring as that one. Maybe phones just aren't scary or something, but this move was dull and drab. No tension or thrills for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. The movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, and felt too long. Didn't keep my attention. It seems phones are hard to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie.

I mean, stealing half your chops from Hypnosis is one thing, cause lots of people haven't seen Hypnosis; but really, OK, you start off thinking, \"no, this can't be just Ring with cellphones, nobody would be that lazy\"; but more and more things happen, and the movie manages to incorporate every single stupid horror cliché from the past 20-odd years of white-person cinema, and pretty much anything you can think of that you're sick of seeing in Asian horror as well, and yet - this is almost admirable in its forthright laziness - never at any point does One Missed Call really do anything to suggest that it's NOT just trying to be Ring with cellphones.(And isn't \"Ring with cellphones\", really, just about the dumbest idea for a movie ever? I mean, that's like someone trying to make Psycho with a bathtub scene, isn't it?)Anyways, driving home, I realized that my initial judgment wasn't really the case anyway, as One Missed Call is also an insultingly lazy, sloppy, cynical pastiche of all the most overdone bits from horror videogames (not many of which are scary, and pretty much none of which are the least bit original anyway) and horror writing (I'm sure if you took every book with a predominantly black cover off the shelf of an airport bookstore, threw them in a blender, and tried to read the contents, they'd be either as good as or a little bit better than the script to One Missed Call).However - this is the embarrassing thing - it's still rather skillful at maintaining a palpable sense of dread. I spent most of the movie wanting to tear my hair out at the astoundingly inept/lazy/just plain useless regurgitation of every horror/thriller element ever, and yet still drove home with the lights on in the car because it'd given me the heebie-jeebies. Throughout most of the movie, I was torn between wanting things to just quit being useless already, groaning when long-haired Japanese women appeared in the corner of frame or musical stabs heralded disembodied hands popping out of nowhere to grab at the heroes (because, alright, shock and surprise me, but be aware that I, like most people, have already seen Carrie, for goodness' sake); and trying to think of the last time I'd been this unsettled and edge-of-set-being-on in a movie made by a white person.

He was at this time best known in the west for \"Cure\" (1997), though it was \"Pulse\" that would make him an international sensation. Assisting him is cinematographer Junichiro Hayashi, known for two other J-horror modern classics, \"Ring\" and \"Dark Water\".\"Pulse\" was released at the right time for American audiences to latch on to. The American version of \"The Ring\" came out in 2002, and sparked a wider interest in Japanese horror, kicking off a wave of remakes. This also helped get the originals a wider distribution in the States -- \"Pulse\" being among those, as well as \"Audition\" and many of the Takashi Miike films that had previously been very niche.Kurosawa uses this film not just to tell a good ghost story, but to explore \"the horror of isolation\" in a world of increased inter-connectivity. With its dreary, depressing color palette and empty space, we find this story about the Internet to truly be about loneliness. Whether intentional or not, it is a clever social commentary that may be more true today (2017) than it was at the time.Some early reviews were critical because the film is heavier on style than substance and the narrative is not completely coherent. But since then, praise has only grown. In 2012, Jaime Christley of Slant magazine listed the film as one of the greatest of all time. In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. \"Pulse\" placed at number 65 on their top 100 list.The Arrow Video Blu-ray is a fine package and a great excuse to re-visit this film. Contents include (but are not limited to) new interviews with writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa (at an astounding 43 minutes!), actor Show Aikawa and cinematographer Junichiro Hayashi (24 minutes); \"The Horror of Isolation\", a new video appreciation featuring Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett; an archive 'making of' documentary, plus four archive behind-the-scenes featurettes.'\n",

What's odd is that one place it is weak in is the plot - it does somewhat tie it all up and make sense but my main point is it doesnt really matter - the director set out to make a scary ghost story and that it is! I see horror films from all over the world so I am pretty jaded when it comes to something \"scaring\" me but this film has many sequences that truly are frightening and disturbing. Some of the images have stayed with me for weeks. The lighting, the art direction and the use of muted colors (aside from reds used effectively)all make up for a creepy, eerie visual. I have to laugh at the arrogance of some of the comments on this and other \"horror\" films that claim since it didnt scare them the film is NOT SCARY. That is b.s. What scares one person may not scare another. You can say the piece didn't scare you but to make such a sweeping statement is vain. I personally didn't like any of the Friday of 13th movies, but obviously those films work on some level for millions of people. This film is so non-American in it's pace and core that that is what might turn off some viewers, but that's what I loved about it. The director just sets up the camera and keeps it on a space and then has things slowly emerge from the sides - he has you start to look and scope and wonder if you are REALLY seeing something as opposed to the lazy, bloated SHOCK moment of most US horror films. There are moments when people are confronted by visions/images of ghosts that move and terrorize just like real dreams - slow movements, awkward movements as the ghost approaches you. Terrifying. The film definitely doesn't know how to wrap it all up but in many ways, I found this film even scarier than the original RING. Well made ghost story. Seek it out, fans.'\n",

Pretty soon the students begin to see ghostly images on their computer screens. And then they are suddenly disappearing one at a time. Writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa grounds the fantastic premise in a plausibly drab'n'dreary workaday reality, relates the absorbing premise at a deliberate pace, and ably crafts a supremely spooky and unsettling gloom-doom mood that's rife with dread and melancholy. Moreover, Kurosawa even manages to say something poignant and significant about loneliness, isolation, and the basic human need for companionship by depicting the unrestful spirits of the deceased as being driven to haunt, torment, and ultimately claim the living because they are terribly sad and alone. The way the ghosts use modern technology as a means of breaking back through into the our dimension gives the already creepy plot an extra terrifying edge. The plain style and no-frills cinematography powerfully evoke a chillingly persuasive sense of a mundane average world that's gradually, but surely being ripped asunder by lethal supernatural forces.

Is death preferable to living, if you are lonely? You are constantly thinking while you experience this film, and you are never sure of the answers. Call it \"adult horror,\" if you will. It is definitely one to see.'\n",

            "Review: 'I fully anticipate some hate in my direction, as some people have really taken to this film, but I have to say that it has just never done anything for me. I first watched it a couple of years ago and I had to force myself to finish it, for the sake of finishing it, but I was overwhelmingly bored. I returned to it again this afternoon (with a little bit of an older head on my shoulders :)) and I feel I can sort of offer a little more than 'boredom' as a comment.I think you have to start off be coming to this film with the right preconceptions, or at least not the wrong ones. It doesn't fit the same 'type' of J-Film as the Grudge or Ring, there are deaths but it's not some vengeful she-ghost hunting you for eternity, this film tries to utilise a different sort of 'horror', on a more emotional or psychological level by focusing on very everyday human fears such as death, the afterlife, and loneliness.It's interesting to see how (although much of the technology in the film is now very dated) some of the comments on it - such as those about how the internet doesn't really connect people - are still quite valid. But one of the problems I came to realise that I had with the film is that its message of an isolated world, with people ultimately being unable to face existing alone any more, felt too forced. It was alluded to or actually stated by the characters quite repeatedly, it was unmistakable what they were trying to 'say', and the more they said it the more depressed I felt.I wasn't scared by the thought, I wasn't horrified or disturbed I just felt a bit blue. Watching the world become less and less populated just felt a little too unbelievable, I felt I was watching a film taking place in some kind of parallel Earth, I felt distanced from it and that distance just sort of numbed the impact.One of the things I did like were the two separate stories playing alongside each other, and the meeting up, but I felt that the male student's story was far more engaging than the co-workers, they never seemed to progress in the story, they just kept dropping out one by one until the requisite one was left behind.I also have to agree that some of the film is beautifully shot, but to balance it there are also lots of grey scenes (some of which are quite hard to see), intended I think to add to the isolated, cold, world, but it's not really enough to break up the film or to keep it visually exciting. You can only sit and watch people having conversations, or wandering around unhappily, for so long. The use of music is very good, actually lifting up some scenes and making them quite memorable (I'm thinking of the jumping woman, for those who have seen it). But there seem to be quite long periods without it, or where it isn't used to contribute at all.I'm not saying that this is a horrible film, but I'm trying to balance out that it won't suit some people. Rent it first if possible, this isn't the kind of J-Horror film (can we call it horror?) that all films seem to be marketed as at the moment, it really might work for you, but it just didn't have the effect on me that it seems to have done on others here.'\n",

            "Review: 'Kario (Pulse) is unlike any Japanese horror I have seen. As much as I love the Ju-On series, the scares come from creepy ghosts that pop-up from unseen places. They are good movies, but those scares wear off after awhile. However, in Kairo the ghosts don't pop up suddenly and they aren't accompanied by loud music. They are just there and boy are they creepy. Sometimes they do nothing, they just stand there, staring. It creates a feeling of unease and constantly keeps the viewer on edge.It's not just the ghosts that are unique, the story is incredibly interesting and intelligent. But it is not linear, logical and it doesn't explain everything (it doesn't have to, though). It really leaves it up to us what to decide. This is what is so good about this movie, it's much unlike most horror films. Forget all the recent American horror films, although some are excellent they really aren't like this. This film is almost like a dream in some ways. It goes at a very slow pace (clocking in just under 2 hours) and there aren't a lot of scares. At times the story may seem illogical but I beg to differ.Kairo is really an apocalyptic horror much like the 2002 British horror film 28 Days Later (just replace zombies with ghosts). Also like 28 Days Later, this film carries a very profound social message but unlike 28 Days Later this one is about loneliness and how people become distant through the use of technology. There's also a heavy emphasis on the evils of suicide.Kiyoshi Kurosawa has created an intelligent, unique horror film that doesn't quite get the attention it deserves. If your willing to experience movie that will leave your unsettled and weired out afterwards, look no further than Kairo.4½/5'\n",

It is one of those films that would have worked fine as a 90 minute movie--even with some flaws.But , anyway, this film goes on for about two hours, long after the viewer's interest has begun to wander and you've started scratching your head, wondering exactly what is happening.Toward the end it kind of degenerates into overly long scenes of people running around in blasted, derelict industrial buildings breathing very hard into their microphones and shouting uninspired, predictable dialogue.Some things just aren't very dramatic. Longish scenes of people poking around in pretty much abandoned industrial settings looking for stuff and breathing hard into their microphones isn't dramatic.By the end, we are working our way through a checklist of horror movie clichés in excruciatingly slow motion. Ancient horror movie clichés have to be executed with a certain cleverness, a certain panache, and perhaps a little inventive camera work/cutting. Some snappy dialogue, some attitude. Or maybe you just have to get them out of the way fast. That's not what happens in this film.The premise is rather interesting, but some of the exposition kind of conflicts with the stated premise--unless the stated premise was a red-herring. It's hard to tell from what they give you on screen and the film didn't motivate me to try to figure it out.So, nice idea, good start ... really, really slow, pretty much unimaginative ending.Maybe if they had had a bigger special effects budget ...'\n",

I had seen the American re-make before this film, and i'm kind of glad I did, because I got to save the best for last. If you were disappointed by the American Pulse, this predecessor will certainly make up for that sorry excuse for a horror.I can say without a doubt this is one of my top films to watch alone in a dark room if I wanted to scare the hell out of myself. And that just puts a big grin on my face. Not to mention, the lighting and cinematography in this film is also really well done, and adds a lot to the completely creepy mood throughout. While the story may be hard to follow if you don't know the history behind the film beforehand, it's scary either way. I've watched it twice now, and it's just as good the second time around. Even though this film is considered an older J-horror film, it's still fresh in my book.I think horror film makers that rely on cheap thrills and gore should take Kairo for a spin, they'd learn a lot from it. Kairo is a truly haunting, scary film that will leave your eyes wide open in terror. 10/10'\n",

            "Review: 'This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. What I did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating.I love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans. However, one genre that has become popular in recent years that I just can't relate to very well are these horror films. I know they are super popular--especially since they seem to be remade so often in the States. I've seen both RINGU as well as THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. About the only recent horror film I really liked from Japan was SEANCE--a reworking of the great British film, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what, do I think, made SEANCE different? Well, unlike the other films as well as KAIRO, gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience--instead, the emphasis was on the story. The bottom line is that these other films are a lot like American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13th--with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want story--not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film.With a relatively high rating, I know I am in the minority, but I just don't find this a very satisfying film. All too often, minor things occur that might startle someone slightly--but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say \"this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking\". Well, I think it just tries too hard and I wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression--not scare tactics.'\n",

            "Review: 'This movie is very touching. In fact, almost painfully so. I would recommend it to anyone in the mood to engage in a thought-provoking narrative about the human condition.I have to admit that when I first saw this film I did not expect it to be what it is. The basic premise involves a haunted website, so when I sat down to view it I was expecting something at the same level of terrible as fear.com; instead, I was shocked to find a truly provocative story full of surrealism and drama that examines the concept of isolation and the deep fear that all people have of loneliness.This, of course, means that the fear that Kairo invokes is not typical of the horror movie genre--at least not the North American horror movie genre; I can't speak for the Japanese--because it isn't really scary. It's disturbing and eerie, and frankly I wouldn't watch it alone in the dark, but I'll admit that I'm a bit of a coward (The Grudge still terrifies me, so make of that what you will). If you go into this movie wanting to see people being hacked apart, or if you want to be jumping out of your seat every few minutes by fake-out scares, you will probably be pretty angry by the time this one's over. Seriously--you'll probably be more freaked out by the original version of Dark Water, and that's saying something.However, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. This film provides a very moving portrayal of people's inability to truly connect with one another. It offers a bleak examination of human nature without being heavy-handed or pretentious; it doesn't come off as condescending and the creators obviously aren't trying to be snobbish or \"intellectual\". It simply asks the question: can we ever truly connect with one another, or are we doomed to be alone by our very natures?'\n",

            "Review: 'Righto, another Japanese ghost story along the lines of The Ring and  The Grudge, among others.  I hadn't heard of Kairo but picked it up off the shelf after reading  some glowing blurb on the DVD cover, (Stupid. Stupid! STUPID!!). What I  found was a depressing, disjointed and generally confusing piece of low  rent film making in search of inspiration that never came.  The basic premise of Kairo is that there simply isn't enough room for  ghosts anymore, so they must find \"other means\" to be heard, and are  often forced into the environment of the living.  At least that is what I am going with, this thing is as confusing as  f*ck.  When I say \"other means\", in this case it means ghosts have gone  high-tech, they are more internet savvy than most teens, and aren't  averse to calling the odd mobile phone for a chat. Where the title  Pulse comes in I have no idea, a more catchy title would have been  Ghost Hackers, would've made more sense too.  Now a bunch of stuff happens in Kairo and I'm sure if you took the time  to watch it you might initially not notice that none of it makes sense  whatsoever.  It seems that from the early stages the ghost(s) seem to be targeting  the employees of a Japanese plant store, as one by one they are bumped  off.  So this is a summary of the first hour:  \"Taguchi is missing and he has the disk!\"  Shortly after: Exit Taguchi.  \"Oh no, not you too Yabe!\"  Exit Yabe.  \"The Boss too?\"  No more Boss. (Yay sickies for everyone!)  \"Now Junco!\"  It's like an \"Axe-murderer slaughtering horny teens flick without the  benefit of T&A, gore and inventive kills. You might ask \"What time does  the next bus leave?\", to which I would reply \"What the hell type of  question is that?\". You might then more rationally ask \"But is it  scary, do they build tension?\" Well now that's a better question. The  answer? Not really aside from one scene that took forever, also made no  sense, and then finished up by being a wannabe The Grudge out-take, not  something I would aspire to.  Sure there are the subliminal things that seem to come up a lot these  days:  - The reflection that can magically be enhanced and magnified from a  crappy resolution image on a PC screen. - The \"did I just see that?\",  rub the eyes, nothing there, \"wait now it's back\" thing. - The shadow  on the edge of the screen walking behind while a \"whoosh\" sound effect  is used to highlight the sheer scariness of it all. - The dimly lit  room that when better lit shows a motionless person standing behind  you.  The one scene that is effective, occurs when one of our loyal Plantco  employees visits The Forbidden Room. Now you aren't supposed to visit  the Forbidden Room. Why? Because it's forbidden, that's why. The scene  plays out like it should and while you wonder what is going on tension  does build. Taking away a little is some ludicrously cheesy and  offputting \"Oooooohhhhh\" music, (it's really bad).  There are many more scenes that are quite randomly edited together so  as to remove all continuity and not allow the tension to build. This  frequently took me out of the movie as I was always on my heels  wondering \"Why are we back with this guy when 5 seconds ago we seemed  to be right in the middle of the other girl doing something?\"  The Ring was a great remake of a Japanese horror flick, The Grudge less  so but justified a look, The Uninvited mainly sucked.  I know they have made a remake of Shutter but think that the original  was good enough on its own. I know they have made remakes of many other  Asian horror flicks and I haven't bothered looking most of them up.  In the case of Kairo I think the US filmmakers had a better than normal  chance of improving on the original, because it just isn't much chop in  the first place and is all over the shop.  Final Rating  5.5 / 10. All sloppy editing and pursuing a concept that  isn't scary in the first place makes Kairo a dull movie.'\n",

            "Review: 'My friend let me borrow this. With my friend being a major film buff and having a refined taste in films, I was expecting something really good here. And me being a graduate from film school (still making short films and Japanese horror films no less) I've come to realize that the Japanese horror genre is something truly gritty, dark and frightening. Films like Ring, Ju-on and Audition are completely terrifying pieces of horror. This film however is not a part of that category.While billed as a horror film, it really doesn't feel like horror. There really is no tension built up because the pacing is very dream like. Also in all horror films there is a clear \"evil\" plaguing the main characters. But throughout this movie I was left wondering \"what the ?#($ is going on? Are these ghosts? Whats the motivation?\" Even after the \"explanation.\" In this movie, the explanation is trying to be logical, but if you think about it, the logic of it is completely ludicrous. And more importantly it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't give connections to why this is happening with the computers and why these \"red tape\" rooms are being created. Now I don't know if this lack of coherency is a result of a bad translation of the subtitles (but I can speak Japanese and could understand some of the original as well). It feels like certain things were \"left out.\" For example, in the tag-line used for the movie on this site, it talks about a web-cam that is used. There is never once a mention of a web-cam in the movie, nor did I see one.And that is the second problem. This film is so gritty and so dark that its really difficult to see things properly. (that's my one complaint about Japanese films, they are all so poorly lit) I grew more frustrated than intrigued because things were not clear enough the make out.And lastly the characters and situations are not really plausible. The world this story takes place is overly contrived. Everyone is lonely and has no friends. I mean, not one friend. That's not normal, even for someone who is lonely. The way everyone reacts also isn't very believable. It feels like the film maker had something to say, but in doing so created a place and characters which aren't totally believable.I have to say that this movie was completely baffling to me. But there was a very creepy and gritty atmosphere built up. But for this viewer, it is not enough. A movie is supposed to be everything coming together to tell a visual story. Here the story is lost somewhere in the murk of the atmosphere.'\n",

As such, it's a little difficult to nail down. It's an enigmatic, often almost ethereal experience that never quite gives you the answers you desire, instead preferring to suggest potential explanations of its central concept without actually confirming anything. As such, it's both a little hard to grasp and equally as hard to shake off. It whispers in your ear that you're right to be afraid, that everything won't be okay in the end. It's heavy stuff, for sure. That's not to say it's especially depressing or anything like that, though. It's bleak, but it isn't heavy-handed; it isn't trying to convert you to its near nihilistic way of thinking. It's definitely a distinct experience. It isn't always super compelling and it sort of drags as it heads towards its finale, but it's an otherworldly and oddly beguiling horror film nevertheless. 7/10.'\n",

'Kario' is a dreary supernatural industrial techo thriller that never seemed to get going and establish enough meat upon its themes of technology advancement leading to loneliness and being frightened of the unknown. It's got a complex and fascinating base to work off, but it comes off being incoherent and overlong as the idea seems too big with its unfocused intentions. While the cluttered narrative plods along (at least it's unpredictable), it's director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's gloomy and at times chilling imagery that commands your attention. A couple moments can cause goosebumps, but genuinely can't sustain that edginess throughout even with the looming dread amongst the working class urban setting. The environment paints a shady and cold look like something of apocalyptic proportions. Visually speaking it had everything going for it and Junichiro Hayashi's sprawling cinematography sumptuously lenses every frame. Some flashes of arty pretensions seep in. The eerily sicking and subtly shuddery music score pushes all the right buttons. Hayashi's patiently crisp handling is broodingly tailored, alienating and is basically all mood or otherwise you could call it undoubtedly bland. Your choose? The characters are quite a forgettable and senselessly disposable bunch of saps who struggle to feel any empathy for. Kumiko Aso, Shun Sugata and Haruiko Kato simply cruise through it with distant performances.'\n",

            "Review: 'If you liked Noroi: The Curse, you will probably like Pulse. It abstractly deals with the concept of voluntary isolationism, and having voluntarily isolated myself in the past, it succeeds with shocking accuracy. The person or people who made this must have either isolated themselves, or been close to someone who did, because they captured that feeling of wanting to withdraw from society very well. I reached a point where I didn't enjoy anything society had to offer me that was attainable, and just stopped interacting with it. I think this movie captures that feeling perfectly, in an abstract manner. Also the scenes of abandoned cities captured the early days of Covid isolation perfectly. Empty streets and buildings, nobody outside.Pulse accurately portrays one common result of voluntary isolation, which is suicide, or lack of desire to keep living. The first scene in the movie captures how I felt. I think people who have never been suicidal have no idea how it feels. It's not some gothic tragedy, steeped in drama, with pipe organs and people crying out in sorrow. It wasn't like that for me anyway. It wasn't even necessarily a sad feeling at all. I just didn't enjoy anything anymore, and didn't want to continue on with the drudgery of day-to-day life. Whoever created that scene knows this feeling, and people who haven't felt it probably won't understand what it is trying to convey.I think now I am on the boat going into the future, but again, Pulse seems to intimately understand the drudgery of day-to-day life for those of us who have at one time reached the conclusion that life is a completely pointless malaise. Like living out life on a boat. Boring, repetitive, and ultimately pointless.I'm giving Pulse 10/10 because I have never seen a more accurate portrayal of how I felt when I was isolated and suicidal, and to compensate for lower star ratings from people who don't understand the subject matter due to lack of context.'\n",

However, this disjointed and hole-riddled plot disgorged something far worse than terror - boredom and confusion.*************************************** ************SPOILER WARNING************ ***************************************It all starts with a \"forbidden room\" that everyone seems to somehow know about, but doesn't exactly explain how some of the characters know about it or why. They just do. For plot's sake. The room, like many other rooms throughout this movie, is sealed in red (always red) tape. Apparently, it's to keep the ghosts sealed in the room. Why? Well, naturally you'd think it's because the ghosts want to kill the living, but if you thought that you'd be wrong.No, unfortunately, the answer to the problem is something much dumber than poltergeist haunting. The ghosts basically make human beings suffer depression because of loneliness (it never quite explains how this happens with couples or families since the focus is pretty much on the main characters and the rest of the world simply dies somehow), and because they can't resist the depression they kill themselves and/or get so depressed they turn into blackened stains on the wall or floor (depending on how they died), unable to move or escape their misery, yet somehow able to call their friends and call for help, although how they expect their friends to save them, I have no idea... I guess they don't know either.So here we are with ghosts depressing people so badly that they turn into lonely little stains calling for help. This is pretty bad. And it only gets worse from there. There just isn't much logic or common sense present in this movie. The plot, although it does tie the whole thing together in the end, still has severe plot holes, bad dialog that doesn't make sense to anyone but the writers and perhaps the depressed characters themselves (and is being said because they are depressed so depressed they simply aren't thinking straight), and pretty much no frightening scenes to speak of.The ghosts look like people you can see through and not even remotely scary or frightening people at that. They look like normal people. The reactions of the characters that see the ghosts range from absolute mind-numbing terror (where they blatantly can't think straight) to outright denial. The terror is the worst part because it simply looks like a normal person is standing over them while they freak out for no reason at all. It looks cheap and the ghosts simply aren't terrifying. What happens to the characters that all die simply doesn't evoke fear or horror at all. It lacks a lot.Go watch something better. You're not likely to really miss much here.'\n",

Alongside this, it appears sprits are using technology to break through into our world. I really liked this film! It genuinely scared me and felt so unique, it also had a good message and is a film that definitely leaves you thinking!The film had dark and brooding cinematography with a lot of creepy visuals! The camera angles used were intriguing and it really uses shadows to its advantage, however it could be a bit too visually dark at times. Also, the effects haven't aged too well but I don't see this as a problem as it did come out over 20 years ago!The acting was brilliant from everybody involved in the film and I really can't fault it! The characters were also realistic and easy to resonate with, I felt so sorry for a lot of them. In addition, the dialogue was though provoking and incredibly well written.The sound design really helped to make this movie as unnerving as it is, as it was really terrifying and heightened the tension. The score was spooky too and only got better and better as the film progressed onwards!Pulse (2001) was a very metaphorical film with a lot of meaning and depth, it really changed my perspectives on things. The themes of technology and how it can sometimes create loneliness was a very progressive subject matter for 2001, and definitely holds up to this day.Lastly, the film had slow and steady pacing, with a really sad and melancholic tone. The atmosphere is so unnerving and the tension is high throughout the whole film. I was on edge all the time and this was one of the only films that really scared me to my core! Nearer the end it ended up losing me a little, but I don't believe this is any fault of the film itself, and the ending was satisfying but still left a lot to the imagination.'\n",

            "Review: 'A cold, creepy & confounding horror that unfortunately overstays its welcome in the end, Pulse (also known as Kairo) is downright eerie during the first act as it creates an ominous aura of dread & uncertainty with its uncanny premise, freaky imagery & inexplicable body counts but thanks to its glacial pace, uninviting quality & overlong runtime, sitting through it is a slog.Written & directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the film is devoid of cheap tricks & clichéd elements that plague most horror films and makes for an interesting examination of isolation & loneliness. Kurosawa allows plenty of space for the plot to unravel but it also slows down the narrative by a considerable extent. And with no deftly scripted character to latch on to, it becomes an infuriating journey.Also lessening the overall impact is the uneven script & seemingly opaque structure that has our curiosity at first but slowly loses it as the story crawls towards the finish line. An added focus on a single storyline instead of two, a steadier pace than usual & a bit more transparency could've enhanced the overall experience without diluting its effectiveness. It is 119 mins long on paper but feels twice as lengthy.Overall, Pulse isn't going to appeal to everyone's taste but for those who have the endurance to sit through this chore and patiently connect with what Kurosawa was going for here may find the ride rewarding. The snail-paced narration is probably a deliberate choice but it also alienates the film from a wider viewership. Nonetheless, for those who are sick & tired of the typical, predictable & thinly layered horror films, Pulse might just be what they are looking for.'\n",

            "Review: 'Kairo concludes with an apocalypse, with archetypal images of the end, empty city streets and the last survivors of disaster. It concerns itself with an eschatology of the soul of course, but what about its metaphor, what is the end it foreshadows in the present life? Kairo's failure as a great film is twofold for me. One is a failure of a story that makes poor sense. One random happenstance is presaged by another. Moments before the boy randomly encounters the girl of a disparate plot strand so they can forward the story together, he discovers a curious vending machine standing in an empty corner street, he goes over to buy a drink and finds the door of the vending machine magically open of its own accord. The happenstance of a similar event in Seance is meaningfully fateful, here it's an excuse.The other is a failure of metaphor. We got this year in The Social Network that modern technology, our growing obsession with being logged on and tuned in, fosters alienation and when Hollywood has something to say it's usually long past a point of awakening. Back in 2001 the point may very well had been an important one, not too late but certainly not too early it foreshadowed our reality.What matters for me is the meditation on the idea, than the idea itself. The shots of haggard individuals anguishing in dreary rooms, reclining in various states of spiritual decomposition. Kairo mythologizes and tells us these people are ghosts, what strikes a chord for me is the absence of faces or discernible characteristics or their unstable walk, existence hanging in the balance with this suggested loss of identity.Kairo's horror is not simply one of alonenness for me, it's one of dissolution of the self. The metaphysical aspect of this I feel is hampered by the pursuit of a mythologic frame, of a world of ghosts invading our own, as such I consider this film inferior to Seance which I saw a few days ago, though it may be a sensual triumph.'\n",

This only starts to become apparent in the movie its second halve and it was quite a big and pleasant surprise really.It's quite a deep film that features symbolism and metaphors. It's probably a movie that you should definitely watch more than once, to try and catch new things within in the movie and understand some of it better. It's a quite hard and complicated movie to watch, largely due to the movie its second halve but it's an ultimately very rewarding one, even though you won't understand all of it.Even though it may not be your average mainstream Japanse horror flick, it's still a movie that features this distinctive kind of atmosphere, build-up and tension. It's still a pretty creepy to watch therefore, despite all of its deeper intentions. I would still therefore call this movie an horror, though some people seem kind of reluctant to do so. It still is kind of hard to describe this movie and to put it under one label. The movie mixes different kind of styles with its story and approach and you therefore don't really need to be into Japanese horror to appreciate this Kiyoshi Kurosawa film.A great pleasant surprise!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/'\n",

Apparently, people are committing suicide for reasons that really aren't making much sense at all. There is a also ghosts popping up and a theory on them and then the suicides still don't make much sense. There is some commentary on isolation in modern society due to the internet, which could be the main problem for me. I am not one to be scared at the prospect of being alone, I in fact thrive on it as I just don't care for people that much anyway so that removes the main fear causer of the film for me so therefore it is destined to be disappointing. Still, it could have worked had a couple of points been fleshed out a bit more. One minute a dude is looking on a website and it mentions the forbidden room the next thing you know he is there at one of these rooms that are not explained at all (well I couldn't pick up on anything that explained their reason in the movie). Anyone who goes in to these rooms seems destined to die, if they in fact look at the disturbing things there (well it isn't that disturbing really). There is a rather good scene where a couple is driving through a dying and deserted city, but once again why were they doing this? I don't see what drove them to suicide even factoring in the loneliness theme. Just to much left unexplained, I like some mystery, but the point of a movie is to tell a story and this one does not do that very well for me. I do wonder if the red tape on the forbidden room was kind of taken from a Japanese short called \"Crevices\" or vise versa? Now that little short didn't explain anything either, but it was more effective than this movie in presenting itself.'\n",

This is my sixth Kurosawa film, and that makes exactly half I loved, exactly half I disliked or was largely indifferent toward. Cure, Charisma and Bright Future are brilliant films in both mind and body. Seance, Doppelganger and Pulse all bored me to a certain extent. Pulse is great in its technical senses. The cinematography and the sound editing are both pretty impressive. But the script is just poor. It's no surprise that this mediocre film is the one Kurosawa film that has been chosen for an American remake. I wonder if the director purposely sold out with it. It's a pretty standard J-horror plot (ghosts start appearing on the internet), and it seems geared toward teenagers. The effect is only slightly better than a Hideo Nagata movie (IMO, he's the biggest hack working in Japan right now).

            "Review: 'Watching Pulse now for the first time was as hard as starting from the beginning of The Big Bang Theory in modern times.On that side tangent, I did recently start from episode one of The Big Bang Theory having never seen an episode and hearing everyone rave about it. The way they went on and on about the technology for when that show began was difficult – knowing what I know now.And in this 2001 Japanese ghost story, it was equally uncomfortable hearing that dial-up tone over and over again. I don't ever wanna go back to those days!Eh, I digress. The movie was alright. Had some good ideas and a last act ten times better than the movie as a whole. But, I found it increasingly difficult to keep up with who was who and their relationships with each other. NO, that's not a racist statement of \"oh, all Asians lookalike.\" In fact, they all had very unique styles and appearances. It was just a bunch of random people with different backgrounds and employments/schooling that I had troubles with.Also, ghost stories aren't my forté. And honestly, when I started this movie on Amazon streaming, I thought I was watching another movie about lightning strikes or a Mother Nature Attacks movie. But, when it's established it's a ghost story, I try to give it the benefit of the doubt, even though they never scare me.Pulse is about the \"internet\" and how it's a portal. Apparently, back in 2001, one couldn't Google what this \"internet\" was, so one character, laughably, has to pull out a very large manual to learn how to connect to such a modern thing. Stop. I started using the \"internet\" in 1992 in college. Back then, for me and my friends, it was an Electronic Forum (or EF) used between students and teachers at school and even, gasp, off-campus! Obviously, we were in the stone-ages in 1992, but we definitely knew what the \"internet\" was in the very early 1990s and not long after, AOL became the Wal-Mart of the online world.So, I do NOT give this movie a pass that someone, specifically a young male adult in technology-centered Japan, wouldn't know what the \"internet\" was or even bookmarks, the \"screen-print\" key, etc. in 2001. Hogwash. Regardless, the movie is the ghost story to the line \"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\" So, ghosts figured out a way to transport via dial-up (haha, sounds silly and yeah, it was,) and make people commit suicide, I guess by scaring them to death and loneliness. It's up to our random young adults, including the ignorant- internet-idiot to try and figure out the motives and keep their (seconds-earlier-strangers) best friends alive. Oddly, since this was my first (and frankly, only) time seeing this, it seemed awfully familiar and felt like this movie had already been remade. Alas, it had in America half a decade later – nope, not interested in that and it looks awful, anyways. But, it also felt like the other Japanese film, Ringu and its American remakes as well. I guess this ghost portal thing was hot back then.I suppose if you're scared of ghosts and still don't know what the \"internet\" is, you might find enjoyment here. It has some good scenes and use of silence after a tense score placement, but overall, it's too long of a movie to get to the goods.***Final thoughts: I am not opposed to reading subtitles (always better than dubbing!) but damnit, stop putting all white subtitles on top of pitch-white scenes! At times, words were literally fleshed out from the screen thanks to the white-on-white subtitles.'\n",

            "Review: 'Although perhaps not a great film in the traditional sense, Pulse (2001) is nonetheless a completely fascinating work, offering a great mood and atmosphere rife with claustrophobia and a continual sense of loneliness and cultural alienation. The themes and concerns expressed here are very much Japanese in context - both in terms of their design and in their actual presentation - with the slow pace, inexplicable supernatural element and concern over the growing seclusion and alienation of Japanese youth enslaved by their technology. It would seem to be a persistent fear/concern for most Japanese filmmakers, with other films, such as the massively successful Ringu (1998), Shinya Tsukamoto's Bullet Ballet (1997) and Takashi Miike's masterpiece Visitor Q (2001) also looking at the breakdown in communication between the different generations, as well as the overwhelming and often negative effect that technological dependence and consumer culture has had on the post-war generation, in regards to slowly eradicating the basic principles of traditional Japanese social values.The central character of Pulse is a clear representation of this phenomenon; secluded in his small flat, wandering lonely through nocturnal streets and attempting to master the use of his home computer in the apparent attempt of forging a literal connection with other, similarly lost souls. However, instead of attempting to create a straight drama from such a pertinent social dilemma, director Kyoshi Kurosawa has instead presented the idea within the context of a horror film. It is important to establish and appreciate these deeper themes if you're hoping to get the most out of this film, as Kurosawa structures it in such as way as to create horror from the simple premise of globalised alienation. Is the theme successfully conveyed? Well, perhaps... but that eventual judgement will really be down to the individual. Regardless, the film presents an intelligent idea - backed by a series of stark, atmospheric and heavily cryptic images - and invites the audience to interpret them on a subjective and entirely personal level. It can occasionally be quite confusing, with the film often feeling incredibly austere or dreamlike. A waking nightmare of sorts in which the loneliness and alienation of one character is visualised on an almost apocalyptic scale. There's also the theme of suicide and the various social taboos and spiritual aspects that such a notion can present in regards to the afterlife, which again, comes back to the central idea of alienation and characters being disconnected from other characters, even in death.If there is a representation of the afterlife here then it is one that is every bit as lost and lonesome as the depressing presentation of our everyday life, with the characters here forced to live out every morbid, repetitive, soul destroying action again and again in the most excruciating detail. This is where the horror aspect of Pulse arises; not in scenes of quick cuts and the occasional burst of loud, spectral noises, but in the cultural wind of change, melancholy and alienation in which the empty, soulless void that for many people can come to represent their everyday life spills over into the eternal afterlife; giving us the representation of ghosts haunted by their own terrified memories of a life they never knew. If you attempt to view this within the context of a conventional, westernised idea of what a horror film should deliver you may be incredibly disappointed. As with the majority of Japanese cinema, the mood is sombre, the narrative slow and the characters prone to much in the way of silent brooding. However, if we view the film within the context of the social and spiritual concerns described above we get a greater sense of the true horror threatening these characters.The depiction of drab, empty loneliness presented here is frightening and very unsettling; with the gloomy cinematography, ambient music and grey, minimal production design turning Tokyo into a cavernous, empty ghost-town of truly epic proportions and reminding me very much of Danny Boyle's similar, socially aware nightmare 28 Days Later (2002). Whereas that film targeted post 9/11 fear and the rising sense of aggression apparent in British youth, Pulse takes isolation, technological overload and the loss of traditional Japanese values and creates a labyrinthine underworld of wandering lost souls, both living and dead. The ending of the film takes these concerns and turns them into something epic and apocalyptic, but the focus remains tied to the human struggle. Yes, it can at times be slow and muddled, and does requires a great sense of understanding Japanese cultural taboos to really becomes accessible, however, this is a fascinating film; one that despite falling short of true greatness is nicely directed and very much worth experiencing by anyone with a fondness for films that make you think.'\n",

Their films, despite capturing your attention visually, lumber along and instead of entertaining they lull the viewer to sleep or worse boredom. In this film perhaps it's the characters that kept me from really integrating myself into the plight of they who are struggling within this, but most of the time the story just simply either takes too long to develop or meanders without hitting the target goal. The film follows two people for a while, Harue(Koyuki)and Kawashima(Haruhiko Katô)as they watch civilization vanish thanks to these ghostly apparitions which have found a place out of their realm into ours. The process seems to seduce the loneliness from within each individual eventually \"taking\" them over or something(..what really occurs just doesn't have much true explanation). We watch as they try to fight what has happened to all those around them, but the apocalyptic doom leaves little hope for them. Death leaves a \"residue\" which shows the viewer that those who were human have now been \"turned\" over to the dead. One of the ghosts admits that death is a lonely existence which might explain why they wish to exist in our plane, but that isn't quite elaborated on either. Nothing within the story is ever truly explained, whether how anyone was able to come to the knowledge of how to keep ghosts at bay with red tape or how the ghosts work within our world. Sure, we have characters guess and try to explain to us what they feel it is, but how(and, better yet, why)they operate and kill just doesn't get told to us. We see two people alone in an entire city once vibrating a beat of crowds now down to just them(..why they are able to escape such a fate for their time isn't explained either). One thing that really bothered me was an introduction to a third character who is supposed to narrate to us how it all began. She(that being Kumiko Aso's Michi)is introduced to us nearly 90 minutes in and we are supposed to just accept her after all that has already taken place. Harue, for some unknown reason not quite ever explained even when she is \"absorbed\", separates herself from Kawashima and goes to her apartment where the computers show a ghost for which she'll soon become. This sequence among so many aren't quite explained but merely open to interpretation. This film seems to use spooky happenings and ghostly apparitions merely as a tool to confront it's main story..how we as a community of people isolate ourselves from everyone else. Our technological advancement has assisted in the progressive separation from the outside world. The ghosts that have to find a new home will have a nesting place here where the living wish to die(..the opening and closing show many sad souls just wishing to end their not so wonderful lives). Ultimately, the film does seem to explain one thing right, death is a cold, lonely place and we that are alive ought to appreciate our time on earth. I chalk this up as an interesting failure.Kurosawa has captured our minds visually as the world seems to be desolate once everyone is taken away, but misses because the ghosts and their story just aren't quite developed enough.'\n",

These spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, I don't really know because the films a bit of a mess...This Japanese production was written & directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa & right off the bat I have to say I hated Kairo, I hated everything about it & it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as crap as any American filmmaker. The script is an overlong mess, the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film, sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way & Kairo is also the most downright boring film I've sat through this year. At two hours long this is a real chore to sit through, I really wanted to fast-forward it but I'm fair if nothing else so I stuck it out to the bitter end & frankly wished I hadn't. There are so many things wrong with Kairo, I suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous & deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which I despise in a film unless they are done properly. Then there's the whole internet thing which I just couldn't relate to at all, I use the internet all day & it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way. Then there's the fact that Kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me, maybe I'm a Neanderthal but I kind of like the films I watch to entertain me, make some sort of sense & not bore me to death.Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as I'm concerned, if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the DVD & you be fast asleep within 10 minutes I guarantee you. I didn't think Kairo was scary in the slightest, the whole internet thing was laughable & as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads I get, now that's scary! I hate this film, I hate this film, I'm sorry I just need to make that basic point again, twice. Forget about any action, tension or gore as there isn't any. If you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly PG rated stuff all the way. Urgh.The film looks so dull & boring it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots & when it does move it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so I won't bother, it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language & you don't know what they are saying.Kairo is crap, I hated it & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Just because it's an Asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good & the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact it makes no sense & it's an absolute bore means Kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an American production. The worst film I've seen this year by some distance. Kairo got a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).'\n",

I love the haunting atmosphere that pervades the feature, cemented with scenes of desolation - empty buildings and streets.I wish I had more concrete praise to offer.There's a vague theme about not giving in to despair and loneliness, as such surrender is the real killer. This thematic content is stronger than any specific sense of narrative - which seems backwards, but here we are. For as much as the Internet is emphasized in one way or another, it's nothing more than a starting point for the plot. For as much as red tape is emphasized, it doesn't seem to serve any actual function in-universe, and therefore none in the plot. And because a few different ideas seem to be put forth, it's unclear why events transpire in the first place. The netherworld is the embodiment of loneliness, maybe? Ghosts want to pass into the real world from the netherworld - because the real world is inherently not lonely, maybe? Ghosts and humans can't coexist in the same space, maybe? Ghosts want to make friends, maybe?I can abide narrative that is disordered, weak, minimized, or scarce - but I do generally require narrative of some kind in a movie, or some overarching unifying quality. Unless... is that lingering ambiguity the whole point? Is the lack of clarity about what is happening, or why, the other side of the coin to the looming air in the picture of nervous foreboding?I've only seen a few other Kiyoshi Kurosawa features, but I greatly enjoyed those that I have. I began watching 'Pulse' with high expectations, and I'm sad to say I'm let down. I don't think it's outright bad, but I want to like it much more than I do. The great atmosphere and music keep the film aloft while deeply indistinct writing prevents it from achieving greater heights. Why, as if to accentuate the very difficulty I'm having - I note two blurbs from critics who, speaking from opposite perspectives, still had the same conclusion. Stephen Hunter, for The Washington Post, wrote a positive review in saying \"'Pulse' is best enjoyed if it's not questioned too closely. It lives visually in a way it cannot live intellectually.\" In a nearly identical remark, Jeff Shannon's critical review for The Seattle Times observed \"While it's rattling your nerves, 'Pulse' leaves your brain wanting more.\"I don't know anything about ghosts, but 'Pulse' definitely exists in a liminal space between life and death. Or is that uncertainty also wholly intentional?Obviously many other people have gotten more out of this than I have; I'm glad for them. Perhaps given more time and consideration I'll turn a corner and regard 'Pulse' more highly. As it is, much to my disappointment, I'm just unsatisfied.'\n",

But perhaps that was the key here, the essential ingredient - or rather the lack of it: the fact that there is no gore. Just like in the Japanese \"Ringu\", the eeriness comes out of what is insinuated rather than catchup-stained limbs flying through rooms as if they had wings. \"Kairo\" remains interesting in spite of its 2-hour length, although a little editing snip here or there might have made it a little more compact. The dialogue is mostly standard, i.e. not that interesting (with some exceptions), so it's the ghost scenes that elevate this movie above 98% of the usual horror crap. The story is slightly muddled (or were my subtitles bad?) but it matters not. \"Kairo\" shows once again why the Japanese (or Orientals in general) have an upper hand in the genre in recent years.And even if you disliked it: it still beats watching a Stephen King or Wes Craven film, doesn't it? Plus, Japanese actresses are so much better-looking than the increasingly ugly, masculine blonds Hollywood serves us lately...\"Printo screenki\": this is how one male character referred to a certain computer-keyboard feature...'\n",

Like many horror films, it sets to work on us right from the beginning, before anything is happening to be scared about: immediately the Psycho music kicks in and the camera moves jarringly. These devices have the effect on me of recognizing them to be independent of what the screen's showing. At the same time, the movie develops in the standard deliberate monotone of Japanese thrillers, but whereas in some of them, e.g. Ring, the audience is actually being fed information at a steady rate, here it has to wait a long time to find out what's going on, and this does not particularly arouse curiosity. It is quite interesting, however, once it's revealed--more interesting than the story that's built around it. Although the theme--the erosion of the line between the living and the ghostly--is accurately illustrated by the central image--ghostlike figures on monitors--somehow the phenomenon seems not quite to jibe with the explanation of it. And the last stage of the invasion, if it can be called that, happens very suddenly, and I don't understand how it came to happen. (This section of the movie looks a lot like anime.)This director's films all tend to remind me of other movies. Cure is like Angel Dust, and this one is like Ring, with computers. To me they never seem to get far beyond the resemblances; never seem quite to get where they're going.'\n",

            "Review: 'The web is a prolific space for the circulation of what is not properly matter. Indeed, the moving force in Kiyoshi Kurosawa's movie Kairo is an Internet site that shows bleak glimpses of lonely, motionless, grieving, silent, or simply bizarre individuals. Their walls are covered with requests for help. A white script on a black background asks if you want to see a ghost, leaving the feeling that those people no longer belong in this world. Ultimately, Kairo exploits the atmospheres of gruesome scenarios to tell something else, in this case dissecting what may be the most intimate fears of human existence, that is, death and isolation.The idea at the basis of the film is simple. In one of the first sequences, a software is shown in which dots wander across the screen. If they move too far, a force brings them together again, but if they get too close, they melt and disappear. It is stated how this is a representation of the inner functioning of the world the characters are inhabiting, this meaning that living is no other than being doomed either to disappearance or loneliness. Not only that. For those who come to take their lives, it is common to take their leave with one certainty, that there can be no worse than this. There's no other relief than dying. But, for the spirits of Kairo, death is nothing but the crystallization of their loneliness.In a genre that has always sought to probe the deepest fears of the human soul, Kurosawa appropriates the primal fear of death by stripping it of any possibility of catharsis. In addition, as early as 2001, the year of the film's production, technology functions as an amplifier of the unease of a society that is decaying in on itself, in a criticism of a modernity that is just slaughtering and eating it up the human being.And, of course, it is scary. The slow camera movements, jarring music, and constant silences build a palpable tension and claustrophobia that permeates the entire picture. Despite almost zero violence, the apparitions terrify in their sluggish, but ultimately harmless trudging through the scene. Considering the labyrinthine narrative, the suffocating use of cinematic timing, the almost prophetic reflection of modern technology and evaluating the effectiveness of a horror movie by its ability to tear the viewer apart, Kairo is indeed the most disturbing film of the last century.'\n",

As I started watching this, I was waiting with anticipation to see what kind of story would be unfolded; the movie ended and still nothing had happened except the best part--the credits. How did this even get passed off as a movie???????? Some things I will never understand!This movie was seriously overrated. It has a pretty slow build up that just eventually levels off because you start dozing off. My friend literally fell asleep on me in the middle of this movie. He woke up and was like \"Did I miss anything?\" And folks you already know what my response was. The characters in this movie were so static. They had no character development and heck, when they died I didn't feel anything at all. I actually felt happy because that was one less character who would potentially add a subplot and drag out this horrible movie. You feel no attachment to any of the characters in this movie nor do you care what they are doing or what is going to happen to them. To answer my question, yes, this movie does deserve a genre. It belongs in the trash. I didn't like this movie, but you might so you can still give it a try. Just don't watch this movie with the expectations of an actual thriller/horror. This movie is extremely slow paced and gets caught up in its own storyline.

There used to be a time when I was captured by the hype and forced myself to believe slow Japanese movies simply have to be good. Anyone who does not like them, simply does not get it. Yet lately, I have come to understand that many of those movies really are just boring, shallow, and expressionless. Japanese movies are not great in general because of their nationality, just like American or German films are not. I just recently saw Dark Water and Tomie and thought they were very dull. I did not really expect this to be very different. Luckily, I was positively suprised. Right at the beginning I noticed how incredibly beautifully this film was shot. Towards the middle of it though, it seemed to me as if this would be just another bad Japanese movie. It developed all the signs of that. E.g. charachters that are unnaturally introverted, even for a Japanese; that don't talk about the things, that happen to them. You can't really connect to those charachters, they don't have much of a charachter development. We've got a lot of atmosphere shots, but nothing really happens. Just what I feared. This kind of movie is not arty or culturaly meaningful. Its just shallow. Yet, as the film went on, I noticed this one is different. It seems to criticize the japanese culture for this lack of communication. What I thought would be a bad charachteristic of it, is actually the central point of it. It seems like the director consiously displayed the charachters, the way I described before, not because this is just another boring japanese movie, but because he tries to criticize this charachteristic of the Japanese society. At some point in the movie it is being said that the ghosts attempt to capture the people in their eternal loneliness. This may be a very strong hint. In the end it seems like this movie does not merely inherit the same bad aspects of other movies but analyzes them and more so the society behind it. In the end it is being said that there seem to be people alive in Latin America. Guess why: because they talk! They communicate, talk about the ghosts and don't let themselves become lonely that easy. None of the Japanese charachters in this movie seem to have friends. The main charachter tells the girl with the car that he had one friend who he did not really know. He also said earlier that he maybe got an internet connection to meet people.

This film was SLOW, never managing to build suspense and usually cut away (often disjointedly) when any suspense did try to build. When any \"shocking\" moment did occur there was no thrill; just a sense of relief that something finally happened. I did like some of the cinematography (such as a scene through the city at the end) as it often worked well to set the mood, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to salvage the story.

The superficial \"connections\" that one sustains with other people are conveyed as brittle, meaningless trivialities that shatter when confronted with the relentless isolation that exists on a much deeper level. Not one person is murdered in this 119 minute film for the very fact that the victims are consumed with a sense of eternal loneliness  many times caused by seeing spirits  and therefore take their own lives. There are no cheap scares in this picture, as it relies on disturbing, long-sustained images highlighted by awkward ghost movements. Classic scenes and imagery abound in this tour de force directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.Kiyoshi is a criminally unknown director who is undoubtedly the single best filmmaker in the history of horror cinema. Unfortunately, many people confuse greatness with influence. Hideo Nakata is not a great director, but he did influence the entire film-making industry with Ringu. Kiyoshi Kurosawa, on the other hand, just makes great films  Kairo, Cure, Charisma, Retribution, Séance, Loft, etc. That's the essential difference between excellence and mere market influence. Now, Kiyoshi does get some respect from both moviegoers and critics alike, but there are some common complaints that I would like to address in conjunction with this review of Kairo.The most outrageous criticism of Kiyoshi is that his films lack content. This is a patently false (and downright ridiculous) claim that holds no weight whatsoever. Taking Kairo as an example, there are a number of subtle references to LONELINESS throughout the entirety of the film  the literal isolation of characters, the individual dots expressed within the computer program, the patterns of dissolved ash, the influence of communication and information through both ghostly apparitions as well as red tape, apocalyptic doom, suicide, character mannerisms and interrelationships, etc. In other words, there's a boatload of content in Kairo. Those who say otherwise have no idea what they're talking about.This structure of film-making is one thing that makes Kiyoshi so amazing. He takes a simple concept like loneliness and creates a constellation of phenomena that reference back to the underlying theme of the film. The same is true with Cure (identity), Charisma (false dichotomies, relationship between the individual and society), Retribution (memory), Loft (memory), and others. It's a fascinating method of storytelling that's so much fun to watch despite the glacial pacing from which it's presented. Don't fool yourself: the entertainment value of Japanese horror is frequently about content, and Kairo is a perfect horror movie largely because of its philosophical elements. How many other films can make the same claim? What more do you people want? How the massive quantity of content within Kiyoshi's cinematic portfolio goes unnoticed is beyond me. The only possible explanation is that his stunning talent for creating dense atmosphere leads some viewers to overlook his content. Still, there's no excuse for missing it, especially considering how badly made dramas get all sorts of credit where none is due. For example, there are tons of reviews for Tsai Ming-liang's dreadfully atrocious Viva L'Amour that gloat about that movie's depiction of solitude. I read these reviews with the knowledge that Kairo gets little to no credit for its truly amazing portrayal of loneliness. The whole scenario makes me want to puke.Another criticism of Kiyoshi is that his films are \"self-indulgent.\" What a load of twaddle coming from reviewers who consider Akira Kurosawa to be the best thing since sliced bread. Anyone dim-witted enough to claim that Akira Kurosawa's Dreams is less indulgent than Kairo should immediately check themselves into a mental institution. So Akira gets a free pass at self-masturbatory cinema because some Californian bloodsuckers propped him up on an undeserving pedestal? You people are a joke. From the standpoint of sheer directorial precision and scriptwriting, Akira doesn't even deserve to sniff Kiyoshi's jockstrap.Then we have all sorts of assertions that say Kiyoshi's films are slow and boring, but most of these comments are made by Hollywood fanboys who drool over rat-infested garbage like Friday the 13th, Freddy vs. Jason, and Alien vs. Predator. I would expect this reaction from those with such narrow-minded \"tastes\" in film. Just leave the intelligent horror cinema to the big boys and go back to worshipping overrated hacks like Wes Craven.But that's not all. We have even more ludicrous complaints coming from Westerners like, \"The Japanese take their horror films too seriously.\" I laugh when hearing stuff like this. God forbid someone actually puts some effort into making a horror film. Has the Hollywood horror industry really crumbled to the point where even their most fervent followers don't expect anything remotely ambitious? That's a pretty pathetic state to be in.The point of this review-turned-rant is to simply point out the obvious: Kiyoshi Kurosawa is the greatest horror filmmaker that ever lived. It might just be my opinion, but considering how any and all criticism seems to be based on illogic or narrow-mindedness, there's really no valid reason for believing otherwise.'\n",

It seems rather like the director's personal remake of Ring(u), covering many of the same themes of technological angst and ghost stories. It even has the now archetypal figures in white with long black hair. The plot is muddled and meandering, and while the plots of Charisma and Cure were also muddled, it seemed as though those films actually had a central idea that they were aiming for. Pulse just seems like a mishmash of early 21st-century Japanese horror tropes, fused clumsily to the apocalyptic themes common in the nineties and before (as seen in copious anime from, say, Barefoot Gen onwards). Kurosawa does try to impose some structure on the movie with visual motifs and his usual excellent command of atmosphere, but it isn't enough to keep the movie interesting without a strong story to back it up.Kiyoshi Kurosawa is definitely a director worth watching. I wouldn't say the same for this film, although if you're already interested in Kurosawa it is worth tracking down (Cure - or Kyua - would be a better movie for newbies to start with, though). It is, at least, better than the noodling Doppelganger, which blends Pulse's fuzzy purposelessness with some poorly executed light comedy.'\n",

For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad (\"What if something strange is going on?\"...what????). The acting didn't blow my socks off either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all. Another thing is that the movie extremely boring. Extremely. Sure, there are a couple of \"jolts\" here and there, but for the movie's 112 minute length, it sure didn't use it's time up wisely. Most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot. What was the point of that??To top it off, the movie makes no sense. Yes, I believe I understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. Also, much of the movie is played out in little vignettes, which makes the story hard to follow at times. And don't even get me started with the ending. What exactly happened there?I can give Kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film. There are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images. If they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. But they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. Yes, it's a message movie. Okay, fun. I'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open: find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this.'\n",

A kind of \"Carnival of Souls\" for the cyber generation, the film revolves around restless spirits who have figured out a way to use personal computers as portals back into the real world.Unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline. Much of the time we can't tell what is going on, partly because the picture is so grainy, and partly because the screenplay itself is so muddled. Characters come and go and we have no idea who they are or what indeed is happening to them. There are, admittedly, some creepy, otherworldly moments in the film, but they are undercut by the desultory pacing and the overall lack of clarity. Valiantly, the filmmakers have thrown in a few existentialist comments about the pointlessness and loneliness of existence, but they aren't nearly sufficient to help the movie overcome its many weaknesses.An admirable failure, \"Pulse\" at least earns points for trying - but not for succeeding in its endeavor.'\n",

Neither of us are idiots but we are massive horror fans. The characters turn up at what are meant to be significant locations but you've got no idea where these places are or what significance they play in the film. I can kind of see what they were trying to do with the film but it felt like they were trying to be too clever and then did a rush job putting it all together. If the scares were good then it would have saved the wishy-washy story, but my grandma with her false teeth out is ten times more scary than people standing around in dim light looking at the camera.'\n",

            "Review: '\"Pulse\" is a compelling, haunting, and insightful portrait of disconnection, loneliness, and the impersonal nature of technology. From the opening shot of the lone vessel adrift on a vast, turbulent ocean, Kiyoshi Kurosawa establishes a pervasive sense of foreboding and unnaturalness. The sequences throughout are effective in their restraint -- Kurosawa has no interest in shock scenes or excessive gore.\"Pulse\" follows two intersecting story lines. One involves a young woman (Kumiko Aso) who works at a plant nursery in a high-rise building, whose investigation of a colleague's suicide leads her to some very murky places. The second strand follows a computer-illiterate student (Haruhiko Kato) who teams with a female geek (Koyuki) who's researching paranormal phenomena on the Internet. These characters encounter mysterious and frightening images on their computer screens. The images are linked to various disappearances.Significantly more original than American internet-related horror films, Kurosawa effectively focuses on the fear and melancholy resulting from the urban isolation that the Internet promotes. He is able to establish a sinister atmosphere with dark interiors, diffused tonal lighting, shadows, and delayed focus shifts. Kurosawa is less interested in tying up loose ends than in creating a sense of melancholy and depicting psychological states like dislocation. A bit redundant, but philosophical, atmospheric, genuinely scary horror films are few and far between. \"Pulse\" serves as a relevant social allegory on the dichotomy of human interaction and the self-induced alienation inherent in contemporary urban existence.'\n",

Several unconnected people try to understand the mysterious occurrences, but in the end they are forced to guess and doubleguess their theories with no real explanation to be found. People around them are found taping their doors with red tape, while a mysterious printout warns of the forbidden room. Within a matter of days life in the city has come to a stop with only a few rag-tag survivors roaming the streets...As it is said in circles this is an existential horror movie, which delves at times into philosophy, life, death and the concept of loneliness. With its unwavering negative message and unfailing dark haunting atmosphere it has the capacity to engulf and captivate. Even though the movie is extremely iffy as far as acting is concerned and the special effects may not be up to par to the American remake you can have no doubt that this is a far superior movie.Unlike the American \"Pulse\" it does however shy away from making a predictable and typical horror flick based on random scares and body counts (as in who is next). Instead it takes the route of creating such a consistent atmosphere that pulses you in with the terror lurking in fuzzy shots and not in shock sounds. But nonetheless it is not all that people make it out to be. The existential questions are thrown out in the movie, but they seem very random and inconsequential, almost like a forcible attempt to make the movie more meaningful than in reality. Also some of the scripting is well below par, as character actions lack the necessary cause-effect relation to make the film flow. Additionally too many events are chaotic and seemingly pointless, as though too much information from the book was cut from the script and this made it incoherent (like what is up with all the red tape?).A decent, unconventional and adventurous J-horror which is worth the time spent on watching it, but not deserving of the admiration thrown at it.'\n",

Although the beginning has a couple of good scares, the film loses narrative impetus after about twenty minutes, settling into a shapeless, baggy, scare-less middle act that bored and alienated me. The actors run the gamut of emotions from depressed to catatonic. The presentation of the ghosts is obviously cribbed from other, better J-Horror movies. Portentous scene follows portentous scene, but there's no substance, no care taken to give us a sense of the rules of the game, or the cause- and-effect of the story. That means precious little sense of human motivation. If you're like me and my friends, after half an hour you'll start laughing at the sheer randomness of the action and dialog, as well as the invariably stupid choices made by the characters. At the showing I attended, the theater was almost deserted; I should have taken that as a hint to leave and ask for my money back.

I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart.The story was slow, painfully so. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of \"The Devil's Rejects\" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of \"A Tale of Two Sisters\". \"Pulse\" offered little from either spectrum, sadly.Along with the sluggishness of the plot, it was also very muddled. I hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. It seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors. Unlike \"A Tale of Two Sisters\", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line, \"Pulse\" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors. My closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency. At first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the Internet. That's a damn original idea. I like that. But as the plot drones on, plot-holes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in, it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale (as evident by the ending) that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to execute.I realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated, but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy, shadowy surroundings. I will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie, but that may have just been my attention waning in and out.The actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well, and perhaps if I was more enthralled by the story I would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters. Like I mentioned previously, the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. Perhaps it was a result of the plot's incoherence that the characters do questionable things. To be honest I don't really care.The acting was decent. Certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either. No outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful.Now I'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments. One towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout, I would've enjoyed this movie (almost) wholly. I thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling, as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face. The things that went on between these ghastly run-ins were just too lackluster, baffling and \"WTF\" for me to truly appreciate.Now for something pertaining to the DVD itself... Magnolia's release of \"Pulse\" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. They aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech. It may sound nit-picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others. I think this is the only North American release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBBING!!!) I tried to like the film, I really did. I WANTED this film to live up to the hype... but sadly, it fell flat for me. If you're looking for other creepy Asian cinema I can recommend you \"Audition\", \"Shutter\", \"A Tale of Two Sisters\", \"Strange Circus\" and \"Marebito\" -- all of which are more my palette.'\n",

These films were huge hits there and made their way to the US where fans were fascinated with them. So much so that Hollywood took notice and began remaking them left and right. Probably most famous of these are THE RING and THE GRUDGE. Another early entry was PULSE starring Kristen Bell but it wasn't as well received. Now Arrow Video has released a great version of the original film on blu-ray for fans to enjoy.The story involves two separate groups of friends experiencing paranormal encounters that are leaving a mark on them, some literally. The first group works together in a business that supplies plants to buyers. When their tech guy fails to show for work or answer his phone, they check up on him. While there, he walks into another room and hangs himself. Gruesome enough but then they begin to look at a disc he left behind which shows ghostly images from his apartment. A return visit has them exposed to his ghost as well.The second story involves a college student who finds something odd going on as well. When he asks a professor to help, they too discover ghostly images online. These images have an effect on some that view them and they begin to disappear. As someone hypothesizes what happens to souls when they leave here? Do they go to another dimension? And then the question is raised what happens when, after the millions that have died over time, that dimension begins to fill up? Do they try and make their way back? Eventually the two stories intersect with the leads of both uniting to try and discover the answer to these questions. It is their journey and what they discover that makes the film more chilling than you would expect.Some will be turned off to the way this story unfolds. The back and forth between tales, the dismal look of the entire landscape and the somber tone that it emits start to finish. This is not an in your face or jump start scare style film. It is one that creeps into you, crawls under your skin and makes you look over your shoulder even though you know nothing is there. It takes the ghost story we've become acquainted with and melds it with the world of computers, even if these computers look cumbersome since the movie was made in 2001. The pace is slow as the horror unfolds before your eyes. This makes for a movie that deserves attention.Arrow Video, as always, presents this in the best form possible with a hi def 1080p transfer. The extras include a new interview with writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, a new interview with cinematographer Junichiro Hayashi, THE HORROR OF ISOLATION a new video appreciation featuring Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett, an archive making of documentary, premiere footage from the Cannes Film Festival, cast and crew introductions from the opening day screenings in Tokyo, trailers and TV spots and a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork.'\n",

Kiyoshi Kurosawa has done an excellent job here of using the medium of technology to portray a line that has been crossed over by the disenchanted and their past lives. The result is a dark truth that all is not well within the World that they inhabit, they are slowly committing social suicide. Then the cry of a million lonely Souls are heard, trying desperately to reach out and maintain the Human contact that they have lost.There are scenes here that will have your heart jumping, and your pulse racing; the supernatural method of realisation and the coming consequence of the Worlds independence of this technology is a daunting reminder of our own suicide.Having Kiyoshi Kurosawa win the 2001 José Luis Guarner Critic's Award at the Catalonian International Film Festival, Sitges in Spain, and nominated for Best Film too. 2002 was a good year for Kiyoshi Kurosawa also; for the Japanese Professional Movie Awards had Kumiko Aso, who plays Michi Kudo, win the Award for Best Actress.After The Machine, all there is left is you.'\n",

            "Review: 'I found out about this film from watching a youtube video entitled \"10 Asian Horror Films You Must See\" or some such. I had already seen four of them, all of which I had liked or loved, so I figured maybe the other six were as good.I downloaded five of them, watched three, and one out of the three was fantastic (not actually on the list; this one was a title recommended in the comments), one was just OK (not very scary), and the other one wasn't really a horror film. Then I came to Pulse.This movie was so slow and boring, I kept nodding out. I just didn't get what was supposed to be scary about it; it seemed like a very dated movie that was produced when the internet was just starting to go mainstream, and the director capitalized on the novelty of the world wide web to make a silly, low budget nonsense film about ghosts invading the world of the living through the internet.This \"end of the world\" scenario didn't make any sense; it was just a gimmick kind of idea gussied up with cheap ghost effects and cheesy images of the spirits intoning various cryptic messages about eternal loneliness. This is supposed to be scary? It was more like a \"Blair Witch Project\" kind of deal, which some people were frightened by and others, like myself, who thought it just a bore and waste of time.By the time the lame ending finally rolled around, I was left feeling like a sucker for bothering to make it to the credits. Very frustrating experience and I hope I have convinced you to not bother with this piece of crap.'\n",

Instead the film tries to terrify you by its unsettling music combined with the disturbing visuals of apparitions and the paranormal. I personally like the technological and psychological aspects of the movie. Depression is one thing to be noted from this film. Everything feels gloomy and unhappy.

            "Review: 'Not to be mistaken with the empty and misdirected Aphex Twin video-styled American remake, the original Pulse is one of the creepiest films ever made. It's one of those horror films that catches you off guard by first coming across as an orthodox kind of ghost story before taking you way beyond the barriers of abnormal and just outright chills you to the bone.Japanese University students happen upon a phenomenon of student suicides triggered by something on the internet. Considering that Japan is rife with suicide amongst the young, this becomes the theme for much of the film.Lives become entwined when the close friends and family of the leads either disappear off the face of the earth or go on to kill themselves as the vastly overpopulated city they live in quickly becomes the loneliest place on earth, but then it becomes a global phenomenon.The few people left go about their lives regardless, getting lonelier by the day as the city becomes a haunting ground for the dead but it isn't long before they discover that somebody used the internet to find a way to look into the afterlife, which started the phenomenon. In a desperate race against time, the survivors look for a way to survive even though their will grows weaker every day as the haunting ghosts of the passed away quickly come to outnumber the living.Kiyoshi Kurasawa makes a point of living being no better than being dead if you become lonely enough. When the dead reach out to their victims, it isn't death that takes them but the loss of their will to live in loneliness when life becomes defeatist. By the characters' refusal to let their loved ones go and the refusal to see death as a tangible threat or something that exists where it shouldn't, they repel death although they don't want to live in this world anymore.Not only is loneliness unacceptable to the young, they cannot face the fact that in life, it comes to consume us all at one point sooner or later and so it seems to be about the fear of losing one's soul and identity to a life worse than death.The film takes its time in delivering the story and the shocks like a true ghost story and the little chills sometimes work the best or at least help to deliver the creepiest moments in film history. There's something about Japanese acting that sets you up for every moment realistic or absurd. It's all so well delivered and even if you're reading from subtitles, the point is put across in all devastating simplicity, making Pulse not only a creepy horror but also a tragic drama of epic proportions.The scenes of the city streets deserted and looking war torn when civilisation has simply vanished deliver some of the most impacting scenes in film and I guarantee that after this film you will be left feeling haunted.No cheap thrills, Pulse works hard to get into your mind and deliver an important message at the same time!'\n",

As a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. There's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely. Characters are barely sketched, which could be OK, but they're completely uninteresting. It's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical. Weakest moment: when \"the boss\" sits down to give some incoherent advice.'\n",

            "Review: 'Despite not having one scene where something ill-defined and much less pleasant to look at jumps at the viewer in that \"Boo\" gesture -- a requisite and staple of modern horror -- Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KAIRO is an unnerving collection of disturbing images that are so freakish in nature as to make the skin creep in bouts of goose-flesh. All throughout, there's this escalating dread that like the slow advance of these people who are not quite \"there\", and it just keep on tightening its noose, as if asking one to put the DVD on pause or maybe even turn it off altogether. And for someone like me who keeps on stating that the horror genre is dead, this just made me eat my words.For years, horror movies have been about the way we encounter the supernatural, and the way it haunts us. All of the modes of employ have been used up and exist only as backdrop. There are no longer haunted houses where an ancient curse befell a family -- though I may have to cross that out as JU ON is exactly about that. No longer do Dracula or the Werewolf or Frankenstein (and a huge roster of other monsters) scare us, and the more esoteric entries into its web are stale. It was only time when what we do use on a daily basis -- phones, faxes, printers, television, and of course the World Wide Web -- would be the harbinger that could thin the layers separating us from those who are in another dimension and create an escalating panic.Two stories play themselves out until they dove-tail at the right moment in KAIRO. The first one concerns Michi, a girl working at a plant store in Tokyo. She notices that a co-worker, Taguchi, hasn't shown up for work in a week, and decides to check in on him. When she arrives at his apartment, he seems fine to her, but when she goes searching for a particular disk she needs, he hangs himself. Later on Michi and two other co-workers notice that within Taguchi's files there is a strange picture of his own room and what seems to be Taguchi standing still to the side of his computer, which is also showing the same image. They notice a face on a second computer, and a blow-up shows it to be that of Taguchi's, blankly staring out.Yabe then receives a phone call from Taguchi -- which is impossible -- and goes to his apartment to find Taguchi's body gone (of course) except for a black smear on the wall where he was found dead. As he leaves, he sees a door framed in red tape which catches his attention, so much that he makes the mistake of opening it. Once he does, he has one frightening encounter, one of the strangest, and scariest, I've ever seen in horror movies.It seems that within Taguchi's disk seems to contain a horrific virus that is spreading rapidly, causing mass suicides all throughout Tokyo. One in particular is gruesome even when seen from a distance as Michi is on the phone: a woman throwing herself off a high tower, her body hitting the floor in a flat thud.The second story makes itself present by introducing itself as another young man's incursion to the Internet. Ryosuke is getting his Internet installed on his computer, but the package seems to have a malfunction: immediately he is introduced to a bizarre website that presents images of people in the act of being alone in their bedrooms, languid, tired, on the veer of terrified. A prompt (\"Would you like to see a ghost?\") freaks him out and he disconnects the computer immediately, but it turns itself on again, and an unsettling image of a person, his head covered in a black bag, plays itself.What neither of them know is that from the other side, something has seeped its way into the world of the living. It is malevolent in ways that is only hinted at, as the dead feed off the life-force of those who are alive and literally turn them into ash. One explanation points at something that began almost innocuously -- a seed -- but has grown to such size that it is now using computers as a way to filter its way through and walk among us. Kurosawa inter-cuts this explanation with one extremely queasy image: that of an empty room lit in a sick-green light, as an apparition materializes. That as well as many, are what make KAIRO so overwhelmingly terrifying.Where KAIRO may limp just a little is in its plot pacing and decisions made by its characters. For example, computer geek Harue's (Koyuki) own crucial left turn is an exclamation point of logic but an overpowering descent into virtual hell seen in low resolution video, complete with hoots and clicks and her terrified smile of relief as she embraces something unspeakable. Despite this, it is drenched in sepia tones and suffocating anxiety -- it's the tension that doesn't find an automatic release, but gets stronger and stronger, without stopping for a rest. And nothing is so frightening as to see the vaguely formed image of a man moving so freakishly towards you as you are unable to react, and once he is up and close, all you see are his eyes, staring, quite alive, as he tells you he is real.'\n",

            "Review: 'Thoughtful AND Creepy. Two words not used in tandem to describe many recent domestic Horror films. One of the key secrets to the recent Asian Horror boom is that the films and the filmmakers take their subject seriously. Not content to either just 'gross out' the audience or to be ironic and coy about the genre (or both) as most USA Horror films are these days, Directors like Kurosawa here delve into the very meaning of life and death. There is, of course, a subgenre of gore films such as AUDITION and the recent THREE EXTREMES, but even those display a deeper psychological bent than is found in most domestic product. That stated, PULSE isn't all of a piece. The early section is slow and somewhat meandering is setting up the situation (there isn't a strong enough plot to really term it a \"storyline\"). Further, having been made in 2001, one might get a little impatient that they felt it necessary to drag out the explanations of how the internet runs. A College student who doesn't know how to Bookmark an internet page? Still, once the situation is set up and the events go into motion it's a creepy ride, fueled in large measure by the serious tone and even thoughtful discussion of WHY the ghosts are here, and what the meaning our lives today are. These ghosts are clearly symbolic. They force the \"living\" to examine their own lives. A world in which it is easier to communicate via a computer than it is with a co-worker in the same living, breathing workspace.SPOILERS ALERTAt this point, the film takes a sharp turn into an apocalyptic vision of an entire Japan, and perhaps, the entire world being taken over by the ghosts. The transition from a story of a small group of young people to an ON THE BEACH-like waiting for the end of the world scenario isn't' entirely convincing, sobering as it may be.Not surprisingly, an American Remake is on the way. What is the betting line on what gets more play in the USA version - The Horror, Action and Special Effects or the Philosophical Discussions on the meaning of existence in the Modern World?'\n",

While the remake's trailer seemed scary enough with its freaky ghouls, I was apprehensive how spooked I will get when watching the original from writer director Kiyoshi Kurosawa.And surprise, I found it to be palatable. and it confirms one thing though about the limited J- Horror movies that I've seen. There is minimal in-your-face shock-and-awe tactics. In Kairo, the mood and atmosphere is extremely measured with its superb controlled use of light and shadow. Expect things to go bump in the dark, but not too often though.I believe what makes J-Horror movies a spookfest, is its ability to weave freaky stories from seemingly everyday events and objects. The Ring has its VCR tape and television set, while here, it's the Internet, a website which asks if you would like to meet a ghost, and a computer's ability to dial up on its own. From the start you're presented with a mysterious suicide, before the movie progresses with people in the city disappearing for no apparent reason, and vague happenings with shadows and black stains at spots where people die.The ideas presented here, on loneliness and that human connection, seem interesting enough to ponder upon, as it questions if the use of technological tools like the computer brings people together, or further isolates us from one another. It also tried to ask a hypothetical what-if question, of what would happen if the other region which ghosts belong to, would be finitely occupied by the spirits, and their numbers start to spill over to our realm.Most of the time, nothing really happens in the movie, which might seem a bore to those weaned on jump scares, quick cuts and actual ghouls and goblins making an appearance to scare the wits out of the leads. I liked the shot where the car roams around an empty streets of Japan, kinda reminds me of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, or even cheesy fests such as Resident Evil.While I thought it was not scary, my friend warned me about the after effects, which I've yet to experience, not until the sun sets at least. And heck, I'm using the internet right now to write this too. Hope the screen doesn't go freaky on me...Code 1 DVD comes with the theatrical trailer, which seems scary enough on its own, and a 41 minute long making-of documentary.'\n",

Also, if you're like my family and you demand an ugly decapitation every ten minutes, then you aren't going to be wanting to watch this. However, ghost films do do it for me. I find them extremely creepy and Pulse proves itself to be one of the creepiest I've seen. It all comes down to what scares you. I rarely get scared. The last film to properly scare me was Noroi: The Curse, however a couple of scenes in Pulse scared the Jesus out of me! I have just two words... Wobbly ghost.To me Noroi: The Curse is a masterclass in how to scare your audience. It filled me with fear, and its ending is a real gut-puncher. Whilst Pulse doesn't quite make itself quite as scary (nor as good) as Noroi, it is still one of the creepiest films I've seen in a long time. It's pretty essential that you watch this on your own, in the dark, with the sound turned up (there's some great use of sound and music) in order to get the full chilling experience. The wobbly ghost scene is one of the scariest things I've seen in my life! I can't explain it, but it gave me chills and I had to look away! Something about the movement was so unnatural and unnerving, I was thinking that I was going to be in for one hell of a ride! Unfortunately however, because this scene happens reasonably early on, there is only one other scene that almost matches its sheer scariness.Don't get me wrong, Pulse features a string of supremely creepy scenes. It's unlike anything I've seen before in the ghost department as its slow pace builds up a wonderfully eerie atmosphere (I can't see the American remake being any where near as masterful as this!) and some scenes are full of choking suspense, such as when the man first gets contact from the website. My only problem with the film is that it lacked character development, and I would've liked to have gotten to know the characters better. Also, the plot sometimes doesn't make much sense (I don't understand the majority of the third act) and the characters have strange reactions e.g. A woman see someone committing suicide but then it's never mentioned again. The whole apocalyptic element is also not fully explained, however I admired its ambition.But Pulse is really about its creepy atmosphere and that's what it succeeds in doing. It's the type of film that places its disturbing images under your brain and stays there. I never get scared, and it's refreshing to actually feel terrified at what I'm watching. I didn't find Pulse boring, although some scenes did drag it was never boring. I just found it a little confusing. Nevertheless, Pulse is one of the best ghost films I've seen. It relies on its stupendous atmosphere and seriously creepy moments. One scene towards the end, nearly scared me as much as the wobbly ghost! Pulse has the ability to send shivers down your spine and have your hair stand on end, which certainly makes it something special in my eyes! However, I was slightly disappointed that that terrifying face on the poster wasn't in it!'\n",

That's kind of the best way to describe it, because I think the movie's creepier the less it tries to explain its premise, and also because I don't know exactly what the connection between the supernatural and the internet was, even after watching it. But I'm also okay with that, because it was an undeniably unsettling movie, and it was the mystery and the not knowing that made Pulse's scariest scenes all the more scary.It's got a great sense of atmosphere throughout, and understands how and why early computers/the early days of the internet were kind of creepy. I'm just old enough to remember how both were at the turn of the millennium, and I liked seeing a horror movie tap into that uneasiness and mystery. The low-res video aesthetic and the look of those 2000-era websites were done very well, and well-utilised for the film's horror scenes.I also really liked how lonely it made the usually bustling Tokyo look, but it did push that side of things a little far in its final act - to say more would be ruining things, but I just think it got a little over-the-top, and kind of made things less scary rather than scarier. But a confusing/kind of messy final 20 minutes aside, I liked this quite a lot, and much of its early attempts at being creepy were genuinely unnerving. That's enough to make Pulse easy to recommend for fans of Japanese horror movies.'\n",

It's one of those movies, that should be 'felt', should be 'lived' (living a story that talks about dying, oh the irony!) and not to be understood in a literary sense.Even though there are innumerable symbolisms & metaphors that demand a rather inquisitive set of eyes. Although I'm afraid, this approach wouldn't appeal to everybody out there, even for someone like me, who's well accustomed to slow burns; I too had a tough time enduring its idleness. The pace could be a huge issue and it may as well be detrimental to your experience.So beware!'\n",

However, the longer the movie goes on, the more the story gets to be a bit...dumb. And it's a shame, because the \"message\" of the movie is definitely ahead of its time, but it just doesn't go anywhere all that interesting with it. Additionally, some of the special effects (especially one towards the end) are VERY dated, to the point that I can't imagine it even looked good when it came out. Still, this movie is a fun time, and some of the scares are genius, so I'd say it's worth watching.'\n",

The movie has some nice effects, and the characters aren't reproachable, I just didn't feel anything from the film but casual disinterest.If an immersing, gripping, Asian ghost story is what you crave, consider Dark Water, The Eye, Shutter, A Tale of Two Sisters, Ghost House, Ringu, Ring 0, or even the American remake of 'The Ring'. Kairo simply lacked one thing: a pulse.This is one movie where a remake could actually prove helpful, and I rarely encourage remakes if ever. I will still be incredibly upset if they destroy A Tale of Two Sisters or Oldboy.'\n",

I thought this would be a good thing to watch based on the trailer so I decided to watch it with my friend, however we were both majorly bored and let down. This movie had me almost falling asleep. The trailer only cut out the bits that seemed at all interesting with some \"Spooky\" music over the top of it to make it seem good.Scenes where too long when they didn't need to be, there was no jump scares at all and we were both confused throughout the entire movie. I wouldn't even bother watching this terrible excuse of a horror/thriller movie, its just 118 minutes of pure emptiness.The plot was terrible, there was so many things that didn't even make sense or even get explained. It was so jump cutty, and I understand that they did that cause the name is pulse so it would have a stop start kind of thing but this was just a poor way of representing it.The sounds were also boring, they kept on playing this static computer glitch sound (which you can easily find on YouTube) and repeated it numerous times throughout the movie.I would of hoped this was like the shining kind of level, but putting this movie in the same category as the shining is just offensive to even think that thought.I highly would not recommend this movie, it really is not worth it especially if you're a horror and thriller fanatic like me.'\n",

Some work whilst some miserable fail. this one, straddles in between.The tale mirrors Ringu too closely in some ways for comfort. A mysterious computer like virus or program is leading to haunt teenagers, pushing some to commit suicide or simply disappear. Inevitably leads to our sleuths in the movie chasing up after it all. Along the way there is a parallel story of one computer newbie who somehow finding the virus enlists the help of a beautiful computer expert lady. That is the most interesting part of the film, whilst the rest of the movie doesn't seem to know where its going, if anything the rest appears to be heading somewhere without a map, and meanders too much. Incomprehensive and disjointed, the movie does end up losing focus storywise.The main saving grace is the fear factor. Surprsingly, not really frightening, yet its all in the mind and you are on tenterhooks. This plays very well, and i enjoyed this fact for some reason. Acting is poor in general, but not always bad. The film is a disappointment, but then again it is in competition against some stellar movies.Overall, i wouldn't recommend, but there are far worse out there.

After a while, however, the story seemed to become quite diffuse, containing several plot lines and events that were hard to combine. The movie wants to make a statement about society, but the unnecessary complexity of what is unfolding detracts from the clarity of the message. There is always suspension of disbelief in supernatural films, but I didn't feel that Kairo provided clarity through its alternate reality.

It isn't 'scary' scary as such, but it's written and directed in a fashion that keeps you thinking about all the ins and outs of the film in your head afterwards...and those ins and outs be crazy...In a similar fashion to the Pang Brother's original Eye, Pulse is actually in reverse to most horror movies, as most of the scary horrible scenes come in the first hour. Without ever throwing anything you could call a jump at you Pulse is downright terrifying, especially in this first hour. All the scares are those horrible slow-burn Shiningesque scares the Japanese do so well. After this movie I guarantee you'll find yourself staring intently at any dark corner you have in your house, and if you ever see a door taped up with red duck tape you'll run like hell. This movie, it's a chiller for sure. No big guys with axes, no blood spilt but after this I would gladly sit in front of the whole Halloween series back to back without even flinching.Still, if you're one of the 5% of society who don't find the unknown, ghosts and such and freaky women walking out of step out of the darkness while the soundtrack makes gurgling sounds just a little wrong, Pulse is different to many Horror flicks in that it has a strong plot with an original premise. The idea of Pulse is that the afterlife is full, and spirits are kind of bouncing off the walls in there looking for a conduit out. Because of the loneliness of Japanese society suicide is on the rise, and in Japanese mysticism if you kill yourself, you die without a soul, leaving a space for a spirit to pass into the real world. So towards the start of the movie, the spirits, who have managed to get as far as 'forbidden rooms' areas where the two planes cross over, and are willing those they contact to kill themselves so they can cross over. However, a side effect of the contact is that the contactee becomes even more lonely, and eventually whether they kill themselves or not, passes out of existence, making the spirit's transition even easier. I won't spoil the second half but I will go as far as to say this makes for a really interesting twist in the tale.OK, I've begun to ramble. I just love the story in this, it's such a cool idea. The effects team must be praised, as the hauntings are damn scary and truly original looking. One haunting is quite similar to Ringu, but given that's the movie that launched this genre I'll let Pulse off.So, I think this is a really good chiller. I recommend you see this before Hollywood remake it (as even if it's a decent film it will probably focus on jumps and ghosts, and probably jettison the plot entirely) though if you're in the US you'll have trouble as the contract for the remake effectively bans screening the original prior to the release of the American version. What a load of capitalist BS. Anyhoo. Pulse is a great movie, seek it out, see it, and hopefully enjoy it.'\n",

Supposedly, the spirit world has filled up it's space, and now the dead are seeping into our world using the internet and technology.\"Kairo\" (aka Pulse) is without a doubt one of the most chilling, complex, scariest movies to come out of the Asian Horror boom. The movie is only has a few tense and creepy scenes, but if you come to this film with those expectations, you'll be highly disappointed. Kairo is a mind-bender and social commentary that not only delivers those two aspects perfectly, but also some haunting imagery. Probably the scariest thing about \"Kairo\" is the message director Kiyoshi Kurosawa delivers. He makes the point that the advances of technology is not bringing us closer, but is instead separating us and from each other, and ultimately, depressing us and filling us with loneliness.This is a truly stunning movie. If you liked Ring(u), Dark Water, or any of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's other movies, get a hold of this as soon as you can. I can guarantee that you won't regret it one bit.My rating: 10/10.

The atmosphere that these guys give the movies is what is the scary part.This movie is about a web site that apparently allows you to communicate with the dead. It all is not as it seems. People start killing themselves and it is down to 2 people to find out why their friends are dying.The film is very confusing. I watched this with a friend of mine and we both were wondering what was happening through the film. It is a shame because I was enjoying it, but even when the movie finished I was still not sure what the hell was going on with it. I had to Google the film to read the synopsis to confirm what it was about. The atmosphere was there which was good. There were times when it was a bit spooky and you wondered what was going to happen.The acting was good, but then I don't know any Japanese film where the acting is bad. I suppose it does make it better for them that I don't understand much Japanese. I did learn quite a bit a few years ago, but not enough to understand a film. If I could speak Japanese I wonder if I would still think they can all act very well. The movie stars Haruhiko Kato, Kumiko Aso and Koyuki.This film is good and I will watch it again to try and understand it a little more, but overall I was disappointed in it a little bit. I much preferred Ring, Battle Royale, Audition and Versus these are my favourite Japanese films that I will watch soon hopefully and review for you.I will give this film 5 out of 10.

While its subject matter might speak more to a Japanese audience, it still delivers an incredible movie that might be too grand for its own good.After mysterious disappearances, two young people try to find out where everyone is disappearing.What really sets this movie apart from many other horror movies I've seen lately is the slow tone of it. It isn't one of those \"boo get scared\" movies, it's more the atmosphere that really makes it tick, From creepy things on the screen to slow moving monsters, it's more of a vibe horror movie than anything. This is also to its detriment, since it kind of feel a bit too slow at times.The subject matter is heavy here. From suicide to internet addiction, to not having a purpose in life Kairo touches a lot of scary and real subject matters in a terrifying way. It feels like a movie that would hit harder in its country of origin, but it's not like the subject matters I just mentioned isn't present in other societies.I find the movie unsettling more than scary. It's one of those movies that are supposed to get under your skin more than scarring you. If you are looking for something terrifying, you might need to look elsewhere, this is more depressing. There are so many ideas and scenes that really get under my skin in the best way. Things in the background people appearing and diapering and some really cool ideas for scenes.I think the movie is a bit too ambiguous at times. While it helps to make the movie feel more alive and mysterious, it also goes against a clear ending and to really understand what's going on.The effects haven't aged well either, but I think it's a movie on a budget and for what it's worth it feels scary with what it has.Kairo is a movie that I really like and treasure, but it is something you have to be in the mood for, since it is a depressing story dealing with heavy subjects. It also can feel a bit too slow, resulting in me just wanting it to end towards the end. But overall I respect the movie and really can't wait to see it again, since it feels highly unique and a truly terrifying movie to me.'\n",

            "Review: 'The remake of this film is, in my opinion, the worst Japanese American remake of a horror film. It takes a thought provoking plot, with a slow-moving philosophical pace, and makes it nothing but a silly illogical kind of mystery movie, it cannot be taken seriously. The original \"Kairo\" on the other hand has a unique depressing, ominous, and foreboding atmosphere. It also had a pretty unique story for l it's time, and explored many existential themes, theirs still really nothing like it. Essentially straddling the line between loneliness, depression, and death. This is more than just your average how horror, and it's got a lot on its mind.This movie foresaw the disconnect of the social media age, and the intense loneliness a lot of people, especially teenagers feel. This isn't a spoiler, but the movie is about the isolation we feel in life, particularly in regards to the Internet and technology. The way People it's with each other, it's like theirs almost an extreme disinterest, People talk to either, but are they really taking to each other? People see others doing really weird things like covering their doorways in red tape, but they don't seem alarmed or interested as to why. When People do react to things strange to them, they view it with an almost childlike naive curiosity and react in a childlike way, almost like poking a cobra because they thinks it's funny. This is such a fantastic analogy of how people view things through screens, we see it, but it's not real too us, and we have no real connection to it, it's just there.In the 2020's, it is easy to take for granted that in 2001 this was a pretty forward thinking concept, again this was made before most people were on computers or before social media even existed. It definitely predicted the disconnect created by social media, and the ever prevent loneliness of those who interct through a screen rather than through real face to face interactions. I have watched this movie 3x's, the first was 2009, and it's still extremely effective on the 3rd watch 14yrs later. If you're expecting a really scary movie, you might be disappointment, it isn't. It is a creep fest that may or may not get under your skin, but the film is belied by a deep sense of the foreboding that never leaves and you never feel safe. This film is filled with philosophical musings such as \"death is eternal loneliness\". It's not an optimistic film. It is bleak from beginning to end, and it never be let's up. It's extremely depressing. This is something that will stick with some people. I often think about it. The dead leaving a stain essentially, it's very unique, one thing that did carry over to the remake that was good. This is an underrated film, it predates the film version of ringu, and honestly \"Kairo\" is a superior film in every possible way. This is a phenomenal movie, but it is not for the impatient, and it's easy to see went so many find it boring.I recommend this film to patient folk that enjoy slow burn films.'\n",

            "Review: 'This movie is one of my top 10 horror movies and is unique and original in various ways. This movie makes use of the technique of isolation, shadows, blurred images to cause the scares. This movie is well paced and entertaining. However, don't expect things such as the ghost coming out of the computer or the characters in the movie being sucked into the computer. There wasn't such scares. In fact shadows(visions) of dead friends would be shown in the computer, and there is one really frightening screen saver. The usage of possession in this movie was very unique. Don't expect the possession technique to be like Bunshinsaba and Phone, which the girl gets possessed ends up killing others or treating others differently. This show uses the possession technique such that the person who gets possessed ends up wanting to kill himself and die. They feel very lonely and become shadows and then paintings on the wall and vanishes into thin air. The flaws in this movie includes this movie taking place mainly in the morning( I prefer some of the scares to take place at night) Tension and fear of this movie does not take place evenly.(i.e. The scariest scenes in this movie mainly take place in the middle but not towards the end.)

            "Review: 'Kairo aka Pulse is a 2001 Japanese psychological horror film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and starring Haruhiko Katô and Kumiko Aso. The film(produced by the legendary Toho studios) is a modern day ghost story set in urban Japan which follows a group of young adults who are at the centre of a paranormal epidemic.The film follows the two parallel story lines involving Kudo (Kato)and Kawashima (Aso). Kudo is a young woman who works at plant shop and starts to notice something very wrong with her friends. After witnessing her friend Taguchi inexplicably hang himself at the beginning of the film, one by one Kudo's friends fall into despondent trances and lose the will to live. The victims often receive phone calls from the recently deceased who can only utter the words \"help me\" and Kudo soon starts to notice doorways lined with red tape appearing all over Tokyo.The Kawashima storyline offers more a of an insight into the mythos of the ghosts and explains that the spirit world has somehow found a portal to spill over into our world via the internet. Kawashima himself discovers a strange website which shows grainy snuff-like web cams featuring depressed individuals which asks the chilling question \"Would you like to meet a ghost?\". Through consulting university staff Harue and Yoshizaki it is further revealed that it is the isolation in Japanese youth culture that is creating these suicides, and that after realising there is no life after death people simply lose the will to live. The string of deaths eventually escalates in to an apocalyptic situation by which time the two story lines converge as Kudo and Kawashima try and escape the city and it's ghostly inhabitants together.Kairo is a very subtle and underplayed horror film, it won't necessarily make you jump or scare you as you watch it but the imagery and concept will stay with you long after the film finishes. It is certainly the look and feel of the film that gives it it's unique quality, the amateur webcam footage, the slow-mo effects and the look of the ghosts themselves. Instead of the over used pale-faced, long-haired Japanese ghost the film makers opt for a more classical style. For the most part the ghosts are simply shadows, against walls, lurking in public places etc. This is a brilliantly simplistic approach as it encourages the viewer to use their imagination and really engage with the themes of the film. Thematically speaking the film is very rich and philosophical, to understand the film fully though it is important to have some background knowledge on Japanese culture. Hikikomori is the Japanese phenomena referring to young adults who withdraw from society and isolate themselves in their houses, couple that with the well known suicide problem in Japan and you start to see what the film is really about. Which makes it all the more sinister.The trouble with Kairo however is no matter how metaphorically interesting it is or how eerie and unsettling some of the sequences are it is still, at it's core, a faintly silly premise. This was something much more apparent in the hideously misjudged American remake (Pulse 2006) but it's still there. The atmosphere and dread built up in the first half of the film is somewhat undermined by absurd conversations later in the film about how the spirit world is now full to the brim so now ghosts will invade our world and kill anyone they come into contact with. Simply putting red tape around a doorway seems like quite a flimsy safeguard against this and along with a number of other things is never really fully explained. It's a real disappointment that after engineering such a smart and thoughtful concept for a horror film that the execution feels a little bit clumsy and underdeveloped.If you can suspend your disbelief then Kairo is a great psychological horror film much in the same vein as Ringu (1998) or Dark Water (2002)with genuinely meaningful metaphors behind the scares. The fractured narrative is typical of the Japanese style and does require extra focus but if you let yourself be engaged you will be scared out of your wits. The film perfectly encapsulates the feelings of isolation, loneliness and despair which are certainly not exclusive to Japananese youth and also reflect a time when there was still much aprehension about the internet and it's effects. For these reasons Kairo should definitely be given a chance and just to reassure you, that shadow in the corner of your bedroom is definitely not a ghost.4 Stars **** Have you seen Kairo or Pulse (remake)?

Plus, there is still somethings that I don't understand, but loved anyway.If I had to sum up this film, I'd probably have to say that it's a story about the end of the world from the most unlikely place. From within. Anymore info would just be cruel to give up.Though I've been vague about what goes on in the film I will say this. The atmosphere makes this movie everything that it is. In modern times many filmmakers go for the character's coming out loud and clear, and the atmosphere/environment is relegated to 2nd or even 3rd place. But here the true \"star\" of the film is the creepy and almost unbearably docile environment surrounding, enchanting, and swallowing up the main characters. There's a thin line between good Japanese horror (Ring) and bad Japanese horror (Inugami), this flick is so far from bad that it's practically holding hands with Ring as they stroll into my dvd collection.'\n",

            "Review: 'I found this movie to be very creepy and quite frightening in places. The pacing is maddeningly slow at times, but it unfolds in its own purposeful way. The Asians have a knack for using contrast in film. The fright scenes here come from nowhere and vanish before we are even sure what we've experienced. It is truly a gifted film maker who can create such an instantly frightening circumstance. As we saw in Ringu and other genre pictures (The Eye) for instance, there is a real obsession with fear through movement. There is something so unnatural about the way we see the entities creep around on screen; the power of image is difficult to overstate.The acting is great, although the dialog is sparse (as are the set pieces). This is a movie concerned primarily with atmosphere. The dark beauty of some of the scenes (the tower jump, the air plane crash)juxtaposed against their horrible consequences is very artistic.What might be truly most frightening about this piece, however, is the notion that perhaps the dead are NOT happy where they are. If there was a way back for them, how would we react? It's a great piece of original horror. See it!'\n",

One thing that might have helped is if I could distinguish the characters from each other more I could only really spot the guy with the slight blonde coloring to his hair everyone else had similar hairstyles and kept changing there outfits like every 2 minutes.Now that I've explained my confusion I'll explain why that matters, for me to get. Bit scared I can't just be thinking what the F is going on evey second of the movie and I couldn't really feel for the characters cos I didn't know which was which. A bit of a broud look at the apocalyptic events would have been nice, what caused a plane to just fall out of the sky who knows, I get it's meant to be a bit abstract but it has the style of a movie that wants it's audience to follow it or there would be less ambling around there's like 10 minutes of good stuff.Why I give it a 5 is cos of the language barrier, most foreign films I watch are martial arts action films or Godzilla so there's not too much backstory so I accept I may have missed a few details so I won't punish it too harshly for that but it's still way too long and boring. I give it a few bonus stars for the scene in the room near the end where the ghost thing creepily moves towards camera and that ghost scene in the arcade where it kind of moves towards the guy really creepily and all the scenes of the silhouetted ghosts moving past frame and in the background where very well done no stupid music sting like in Hollywood horrors that trope just feels braindead at this point a loud noise accompanying a guy in the background is just the opposite of scary when compared to a creepy black sillouette in the background with no sound or little sound it's more real so those s cenes really hit well bit considering this movie is a horror there's not enough of it it has good atmosphere and some decent sound design especially in that but where it goes silent and that voice just says help me repeatedly that is bone chilling (I'd like to know why they were saying help me as well).Overall you could cut this into a 45 minute episode of creepshls or something and it'd be much better cos nothing really happens for 90% of the movie, it's a good braeth of fresh air compared to the cut and dry tropes of modern horror but it's just not good enough to warrant more than a 5 but at least it's not the bye bye man or something. There must be a middle ground between this being Uber confusing and how modern horror has like no nuance and explains e ery single thing taking away almost any possible fear, I wanna know a bit of what's going on not enough where it's not scary anymore but enough that I'm not so confused I can't even be scared cos it just feels stupid.'\n",

I just saw a lesser film, Tomie, and was a little startled to see not one such display, though Tomie's eye peeking out of the bag looks like the poster art for Ringu. Long before I'd heard of Kaïro, I decided Lain flows with the syntax of a horror film. Cyber horror. Internet horror. The \"key\" to Kaïro is spoken by a grad student in a library near the film's center. Something about the place dead go finally reaching capacity, so spilling over: someone goes, someone long gone springs back, frightening someone else to death, crowding back yet another spectre in a outwardly spiraling vicious circle. The explicitness of this explanation, tells me it's not what the film is about. If you're going to write a poem about love, don't use the word. If you see the word \"sea\" in a true poet's poem, look elsewhere for its meaning. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's no less true a poet than Tarkovsky who he resembles in everything since Cure, or Godard who he resembled in the couple of yakuza films I was able to catch. There's no God, and no gods in Kaïro (though Koji Yakusho in his two appearances comes close). These people are utterly alone, save for each other. Whatever this film means, or wants to say, is in the choreography, the shadows and those screens, the pace. When these kids (Are there any true adults, over-thirties, on the mainland?) stray again and again into the dark, it's not the horror film cliché. You'd almost think they're drawn to the throngs on the other side. But that's too simple. Try this: Chris Marker's 1965 Le mystère koumiko, about an alienated Japanese woman's return to throngs. Maybe not, or...I don't know. I was going to talk about Lain. Let me just hint briefly, that Lain is full of gods, yet Lain and Kaïro may be a pair.There's a reason you may wait a long time to see this. A propeller plane, not a jet. A low factory structure, not a skyscraper. First time round, ebay innocent, I got a video dub such a joke that I gave it away unwatched. Just to see the region 3 Kaïro, I bought an all region DVD player, and it was worth it.'\n",

It probably helps if you've seen a LOT of unusual/indie movies -- end-of-the-world stuff like Carriers, The Crazies, Pontypool, or out-there twist supernatural movies like Heartless or Triangle, or zany \"horror\" movies like Fido, A Barking Dog Never Bites, and Delicatessen. Also mind-bending movies like Primer or just plain nonsensical but modestly disturbing movies like Mulholland Drive.If you enjoy those kinds of movies, and you don't mind not having everything explained or necessarily even \"rational\", then I think you'll find Pulse to be an _exceptionally_ good ghost story that sticks with you for a long time.Often when I'm sleepy and it's late, I find my thoughts wandering back to the characters, the imagery and the overall premise. It fills me with a strange sense of dread, almost an ache. It's been over a year since I saw the film, and it still haunts me occasionally. I think that's a sign of a pretty good movie.I just wish the film had been less blurry. I watched it on Netflix over a questionable connection, and we don't know to this day whether the film quality was just grainy (maybe on purpose), or if it was due to lossy compression.People have said (rightly) that this is a movie about loneliness.

In that way, the movie was actually kind of David Lynch-ish: giving clues and a mildly complicated and fuzzy plot, while scaring the wits out of you at the same time.The acting was good. Or maybe I can't always tell, because the language makes it difficult... (The English translation wasn't all that good either, but that's aside.) The photography was great, and, in my opinion, there were some really smart use of CGI without becoming, like, jurassic park, if you know what I mean.

            "Review: ''Kairo' starts out promising with some very creepy imagery (that seems to have been ripped off more than a few times since). But it doesn't take long before you start wondering why you're continuing to watch, other than the creepy images, and ultimately just want it to be over.The central problem with the film is lack of character development. Granted, none of the characters seem to last long, but I've seen slasher films where characters are knocked off straight away and even those characters are better formed.Unfortunately, this leads to not only a lack of empathy for the characters, but a fatal lack of motivation to continue watching. Forget the 'hero's journey', there's not even a backstory to the characters. In fact, it's not even clear who the main protagonist is until about halfway through the film.I'll give Kurosawa credit for a visually interesting film with wonderful creepy imagery. But even ignoring the lame script (and the truly embarrassing and completely unnecessary explanation of what's happening), some basic errors in storytelling make it extremely difficult to follow. The geography of where he action is taking place, the mysterious changing of clothes for no apparent reason, the jumping back and forth between characters and storylines.Ultimately, like a slasher film, you know who's going to be next and roughly how it will happen. Personally, I prefer horror that taps into deeper themes or social like 'The Babadook' and 'Get Out'. Regardless, it's possible to give people the creeps and make you at least care about the main character's fate. 'Kairo' just fails to go there.'\n",

This reflection has been the subject of too much discussion over the last few years, so much so that it has become a cliché to use it in the construction of a critique of contemporary technology (which doesn't completely eliminate its relevance, especially in a time of pandemic). It's curious how Pulse, conceived at a time when connectivity through a computer still had clear limitations, already addresses elements of this discussion in its narrative. It even sounds premonitory how Kurosawa articulates here a dramatization of his country's cultural problems to evoke the horror of computerized devices.First of all, it should be noted that the \"analog\" spaces in the film already suggest a decadence that resonates in the psychological condition of the characters. Dark spaces, demarcated by sterile architecture and cluttered with objects, with corners of rooms taken over by shadows. The physical environment of the film demarcates human distance, while sounding dangerously inviting to the existential devouring of those who inhabit it. Kurosawa seems to be influenced by a certain architectural notion present in Tarkovsky's films, especially Stalker and Solaris. The Russian director was a master at using this sterility to amplify a general attitude of sentimental decay in the narrative. Kurosawa uses this reference, adapting it to an environment of individualism and incommunicability that is very typical of Japanese society.The horror arising from the manifestation of the supernatural reaches dramatic heights in the dialectic established right from the start with the suicide scene: an existential monotony that progresses to a depressive state marked by loneliness. What is mystical in the film exists as an element that exacerbates the anguish of an incommunicado society. The concreteness of spaces that are oppressive to any notion of collective life finally seems to come to life as mental deterioration makes room for ethereal abstractions.This escalation of computerization at the beginning of the millennium seems to be shaping the spaces for the tragedy of incommunicability to take hold. The young student's lack of knowledge about the details of this technological novelty ends up working very well as a driver of fear. The videos appear spontaneously on the monitors and manage to break the limits of the screen through the disturbance caused by their content and textures. Switching off a computer isn't enough to stop the horror caused by these apparitions and, even if it were, there's no escape when the screen is intrinsically hypnotizing to the user.Initially a supernatural threat and pure phantasmagoria, the fear coming from these videos transfigures as the narrative progresses. In an idea that is even reminiscent of possession, but which retains its strength in a character more typical of the film's state of affairs, the frontality of the apparitions leaves aside the protagonist in horror for the aspect of remembrance that they cause in the depressive condition of their characters. The artificiality of the imagery employed by Kurosawa leads the film into a contemplative state of terror that subtly develops disturbance through its significance for human individuality.These images and their dialectic between what is supernatural and what exists concretely in the gloomy spaces of the film are propellants of existentialist anguish. They are like triggers that bring out the most fatalistic feelings inside each character, like memories of a timeless human tragedy that finds shelter in the devices of an era.Every shot in Pulse is a testament to the half-empty glass.'\n",

This is a VERY creepy, slow-burn of a Film where the premise is that the 'dead' have filled up their 'realm' and are now 'leeching' back into our 'real' world via our Internet, which is the connection between the two.The Film is unsettling because it does not rely on gore and jump shocks (traditionally the staple of Horror films) but let's the viewer go on this ever collapsing reality with the characters themselves, who too late, have woken up to the slowly emerging threat. The scenes with the web cameras showing 'alternate' rooms and realms are very effective and the slow mental disintegration of many of the characters is again eerie. There are many themes here - the vast loneliness of great swathes of humankind, the depression of feeling alone, the desperation of people to 'connect' with others - albeit on the web - all meshes together into an ever spiralling descent. This is not a 'Horror' film in it's truest sense, more a hugely disturbing psychological drama where the chills occur in slow-time - people gradually 'fading away' to simply become shadow markers on walls. The scenes in the deserted city also increase this fatalistic loneliness.This Film may not be for everyone but I found it a well-made mood piece with more than a little to say about our modern way of life and our almost complete dependence on the impersonal 'web' for so-called 'contact'. The irony being that it has made us more 'alone' than we have ever been before.'\n",

The plot sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out. If one had to describe a plot, it starts with a teenager who kills himself in a creepy fashion, and how his death affects his coworkers and friends. Each of this small group of young adults starts to experience strange occurrences.All of this is tied together with the emergence of a new phenomenon called the internet (remember, this was released in 2001). In a separate side story that eventually intersects with the characters mentioned in the first paragraph, a young man is excited to be installing his internet software and connecting his dial up modem for the first time, but when he finally connects, his computer seems to be a portal into rooms populated by creepy half human/ghosts. He seeks to advice of a computer science student, and together they try to figure out what is going on while being drawn further into the mystery.The film is obviously pushing in a not so subtle way a message about how technology and the internet are making us more isolated and lonely, to the point where the line between people and ghosts is blurred. Even though the message is not subtle, it is effective, and story delivers some genuinely creepy and disturbing scenes in exploring that message. As many other reviewers who are much more familiar with Japanese horror than I am have mentioned, this genre of horror is less interested in quick and instant payoffs than in gradually building a sense of dread.I deducted a couple of stars because I felt the running time could have been shaved a bit without much loss of effectiveness, and because I shared the concerns some other reviewers have mentioned about how the ending felt disconnected from the earlier parts of the film. But I'd still recommend it. Even though the internet technology displayed in this film feels extremely outdated already, the film's message is still relevant, and it left me with a lingering sense of dread and creepiness that endured even after the movie had ended.'\n",

Ghosts that once confronted, open the eyes of those that meet them into the horrible realisation that after life.....you become trapped within the pain of being alone, thus being killed by your own sorrow.Kairo is an extremely dark and creepy film that is supported by fantastic visuals and a very downbeat music score. It has no full on gore, which is what you'd expect when watching the classic Asian horror films these days, indeed most of the torment is created by the things we don't see, so an open imagination helps aid the enjoyment of this film.I have to admit i had to watch the film a good three times to fully follow the story. So please make sure when watching this movie that it has your full attention.If you enjoyed Ju-On The Grudge then you will enjoy this. I haven't yet nor care to see the remake yet, tho judging by the poor reviews its getting already i don't think I'm missing out much! Great Movie'\n",

            "Review: 'This is a movie with a message about technology, one with which it beats you over the head a bit. However, given the time this movie was made and the fact that social media wasn't omnipresent and constantly given flack for how it isolates us I don't really hold it against this movie.Following in the footsteps of Ringu and Ju-On, this film is based around technophobia. Not to spoil anything, but depression, isolation, and suicide are also key factors, which I would say were handled very well in their depiction.Kairo has some really beautiful sets and locations, its depiction of urban Tokyo is frankly beautiful on a cinematic (if not eerie) level. The characters, while not extraordinary, were as interesting/entertaining as they needed to be given that this film is more about the supernatural chaos infiltrating their lives than anything to do with them.Some of the scenes are very memorable, and \"the couch scene\" actually gave me chills, something that horror movies don't really do for me much anymore.It's a bit of a slow burn and you may be left with more questions than answers, but absolutely worth it for the right kind of a person.'\n",

It's kind of a slow burn, it's not the scariest thing you'll ever see in the traditional sense but it's utterly unsettling.It's theme being isolation and loneliness might not sound scary but as the story goes on it sinks into your bones, it makes you think and just overall it's unsettling. It's ghosts are very unique too, without any spoilers I'll just say no other ghost story ends in such an impactful way. Stories like this usually affect a family who moverd into a haunted house etc but this one handles the whole ghost thing I a unique way ad well.I found the directing great too, the editing is a little outdated at times but then again the fi was made in 2001. Other than that the acting is a little lacking at times and sometimes conversations are written a little awkwardly especially in the beginning. Other than that it's definitely a 10/8 for me because of it's uniqueness, atmosphere and a few outstanding scenes.'\n",

            "Review: '*review contains spoilers!* This is an excellent Japanese movie. It's thoughtful, creepy, unsettling & very well directed by Kurosawa Kiyoshi. On the one hand you have your standard urban horror themes of loneliness & technology-as-villain (in this case computers & the net). On the other there's this speculation about what might be waiting for us 'on the other side.' Is death, as one of the characters wonders aloud at one point, a chance to be reunited with loved ones & so no longer endure the day to day loneliness of life? But as it turns out, being dead is just as miserable & painful an experience for the ghosts as being alive is for the human characters, something Kurosawa demonstrates in a number of genuinely unsettling sequences.Kiyoshi has an excellent & mature style - demonstrating a preference for long takes (a style that'll likely drive impatient teenage horror fans up the wall) & shocks achieved within the frame rather than through flashy editing. Two sequences epitomise this - in one a young woman searches an apartment for her co-worker in vain while a shadowy figure rises silently from a chair at the back of the room behind her. It might not sound terribly creepy but honestly I think my heart skipped a beat when that happened. In the other - & this is undoubtedly one of the films most talked about moments - a woman jumps to her death & the camera unblinkingly records her fall & impact with no cutting away.But don't get the idea this is some J-horror gorefest because it isn't. What's so refreshing for me about 'Pulse' is that rather than harping on gore & shocks for two hours the director takes the time to lay out an intriguing story. One in which ghosts are flooding back into our world because there's no more room in theirs. The only trouble being that when ghosts & real people come into physical contact with each other neither can survive. Throughout Pulse Kurosawa balances the increasingly apocalyptic imagery of a hi-tech Tokyo in which life has all but ceased with an insistently humanist theme. Our characters clearly care for each other & the story culminates with a small group of survivors setting sail toward an uncertain future. Meanwhile the heroine of the story comes to realise that having found a temporary happiness with the young student who helped her escape she now has the strength to go on.I'd like to think that's really what Kurosawa is getting at here. Not for him the simple scares of a ghost story, nor the fashionable sense of nihilism (hey, we're all doomed!) which so appeals to moody teenagers, but the message that in life the small bonds we make with each other, those passing moments of happiness & kindness, these are what shield us from loneliness & enable us to keep going in an unforgiving universe. Seen that way it makes for an appropriate visual metaphor that the final shot of Pulse is a stunning birds-eye view of a tiny shipful of humanity adrift in a vast ocean.I look forward to seeing more films by Kurosawa Kiyoshi.One last point: a sequence in Pulse depicts a jetliner seen from street level falling out of the sky & crashing into a building. On the DVD featurette there's a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a location recce for this particular scene. The date? June 2000. Talk about prophetic.'\n",

So far in the Asian movie re-makes I have yet to see a movie that is as compelling in a thriller or a horror as the Asian version.

First of all I'm not sure if its a horror movie, not in the classic sense anyway. It's an existential drama with a low budget and some genuinely creepy moments. If the idea of loneliness scares you then I guess it IS a horror movie, but for me it's more of an \"unsettling movie\" if that ever was a genre. If so, it's a genre I like. About the movie. The story starts of like any other j-horror flick with some school kids investigating a MYSTERY on the INTERNET. Imagine that... What I like with Kurosawa is his talent of taking a well known setting and turning it into something else. Basically Kairo is about the fear of loneliness and ultimately that this loneliness may carry on into eternity. The story isn't flawless and involves some out-of-place scenes, and \"science\" explanations, but what crowns the movie is the overall feel of it. Yes, I will remember it fondly even after another two years, and another. Also, the sound-work is amazing. Be sure to crank up those woofers.'\n",

For had it been a vampire in that corridor or a red eyed growling mutated beast drooling saliva , Satan himself even, it certainly wouldn't have sent those chills through as we've all dealt with that sort many times before.

Set in the same vein as the classic novels 'Frankenstein' and 'Brave New World,' the film explores the destruction of personal human relationships and our fall from nature via technological progress in society. Anyone who claims 'Kairo' is just a confusing horror movie should go back to watching 'Freddy vs Jason'.Kiyoshi Kurosawa uses common horror clichés and scenes which I can describe as exploiting \"sustained terror\" to expose the truly horrific elements of story. Although some people may criticize K. Kurosawa for going for the big scare at times, he does so to emphasize what the audience should actually be scared of - separation and the loss of primal human relationships.The horror genre has become jaded by big box American slasher films, and it's great to see new ideas enter the field, such as those coming out of 'Kairo.' This film truly deserves 10 stars - not only is the film a great scare right after you see it, the horror of its meaning stays with you for a lifetime.'\n",

Also, I've never seen any sort of Asian horror before, but I like the few horror classics I've seen (Halloween, Scream, etc.). What I got was way beyond your average horror flick with subtitles.I'm in my fourth year of studying Japanese, so I'm fortunate enough to have a decent understanding of the language and culture, and it helped immensely to know at least a bit of the rapidly changing state of Japan's culture from its proud, individualistic roots to today's insulated, tech-centered society. All Japanese are also known for being very polite, but with this comes a sort of isolation with avoidance of almost any physical contact. All three of these traits are explored in the movie; though loneliness and alienation are an element of American society as well, they are not nearly as ingrained in our culture as they are in that of the Japanese.And if this doesn't sound like a horror film, don't worry, because Kurosawa is fortunately a skilled enough director to weave this into the slow-developing but immensely appropriate horror device unique to this movie. I don't even understand it fully after having watched it, but if you can't suspend your disbelief, why the hell are you watching a horror movie? What counts is that it is really creepy, suitably convoluted, and it serves the film's message of loneliness perfectly - the combination of all three make it gut-wrenching to see some of the things that happen.If this piques your interest, don't hesitate to see it, and it's best to watch it at night by yourself, or at least with a friend who also wants to concentrate on it, because it has a profoundly atmospheric, desolate, and almost dreamlike mood that shouldn't be broken by side conversation. Don't see it under any conditions without a brain ready to think, and if you're familiar with Japanese culture you get brownie points for being able to understand many of the movie's subtleties that would fly over the heads of American viewers.'\n",

Unfortunately that means they both retread the same ground the other group has just figured out. If it had followed a single group the pace might have held together, but this movie has too much time for too few distinct events to make it worthwhile. It has an extensive focus on loneliness, but it's rather ham handed. Loneliness as a theme in a movie should be evoked, not have a ton of lines saying \"oh no, we're all alone\".

However, I was wrong, it had nothing to do with it.We were just 50 people or even less watching the movie (and I have to say that at least 20 left the cinema during the movie), so I didn't have much trouble trying to read the subtitles as the film wasn't dubbed at all (THANK GOD, you can't imagine how much takeshi kitano films loose dubbed into Spanish). The movie started and for the first fifteen minutes, the film seemed to be some kind of soft Ringu, but after that, the movie turned into a great feelings experience, a surrealist world full of spirits or I'd better say, empty of life.The film focus in the experiences of the young main characters, their feelings, their fears, their reactions. The problem is (and that's why such amount of people left the theater) that the feelings showed and the characters relationships may be too Japanese for the western public. So you have to be quite open-minded, and know the Japanese society quite a bit, to really enjoy this film.Kiyoshi Kurosawa has learned how to do good movies very quickly, in almost 15 years has become one of the bests movie directors in Japan. In Kaïro he shows how hard he has worked in the relationships, and deep feelings of the Japanese people, into their fears and hopes. He knows how to make an awesome tragic opera from what seemed a common Japanese terror film.In conclusion, if you want something new, fresh, and EASTERN, watch Kaïro (Pulse). However if you don't have any interest in Japanese people, their culture, their society, but want to enjoy a really terrifying movie, rent Ringu (The Ring) instead.'\n",

Sad, sad. There's absolutely no way this could be done better by a US filmmaker, as the terror derives directly from the coldness (as perceived by Americans) that is so much a part of Japanese culture. In Japan, this is a simple story of a slow disinterest in life's banality. In the US, it would be an end-of-the-world ghost story. Somehow the manner in which Kurosawa hints at the end-of-the-world resonates as a metaphor for all of us, and I was both frightened during the film and then even more depressed afterward. Really, a masterful achievement. A friend and I disagree as to the effectiveness of the ending (he likes it more than I), but it's still powerful all the way through.'\n",

            "Review: 'I am far from an expert in cinema or Japanese culture, but I think this film should be viewed, in part, as an allegory about the demographic crisis in modern day Japan. Japan is a nation with an aging and shrinking population, because their birth rate is too low and they discourage immigration. The Japanese work very hard and are very technologically advanced, yet not enough people are getting married and having enough children, Japanese culture and society and economic power may fade away in the future. I think the film may be alluding to this.Notice that in this movie there are NO children. Nobody is married. Nobody is having children. All the characters are young single adults. There are not even any parents (one character very briefly calls her mother; that is the sole reference in the entire film to the existence of parents, children, or families!) In the movie, the characters are disappearing and the connections they try to make with each other do not prevent more of them from disappearing . . . eventually leading to an apocalyptic vision of everyone disappearing in Japan. The survivors at the end are fleeing by boat -- to where? to Latin America of all places, where they've heard there are signs of life. Not coincidentally, me thinks, Latin America is a continent with a very high birth rate.Anyway, that's my theory and I'm stickin' to it.Overall, I think the movie is more than a bit muddled. And at least when viewing it on video, the dark lighting and action on screens within screens (i.e., within my TV screen is a room and within that room is a computer screen, and within that computer screen are ghosts) make it hard to follow at times.'\n",

This film is a mixture of surrealism, horror, apocalyptic sci-fi, etc. The atmosphere of the film is great, the creepiness is very uniquely eerie, which I really liked. The clever use of shadow and digital artifact goes well along with the minimal scripts. It also didn't fall into one of those cheesy \"cool\" apocalyptic style.Unfortuntely, however, the plot feels like \"I don't know how to finish this story, let's wrap up and go home\". If it's an arthouse film, I would definitely purely enjoy the \"feeling\" without any plot, but certainly this film is not an art film.It's a big shame because this film could have been a great classic with a more complete plot. It doesn't need to have a clear ending, can be left ambiguous like many other great classics, but at least it needs more \"completeness\" in storytelling. It just builds up tension without releasing it.'\n",

            "Review: 'It's a pretty smart story. By surreal way, the movie is telling the social problems in Japanese society. Each character is presenting different classes of people. They all are failing apart with their depressing life. It was made in the most depressing point by given the realism inside view of the young Japanese generation. PLEASE CONSIDER IT COULD BE SERIOUS SPOILERS FROM HERE!The first ones to fall in evil darkness are the weakest ones... the computer geeks, then other weak people with little social skills. The stronger ones whom are not only good looking and optimistic but also with the handsome pocket. But even them can't escape the darkness, most likely by losing the love one. Only the strongest people escaped the evil pandemic by.... abandon Japan to live oversea. LOL But with so many references and attentions, the director failed to execute the idea. Firstly, by the political points, the film shows the social issue of a capitalism but with fascism culture where the biggest heritage families and strong finance people get bigger advantages in life. Honestly there was only a positive point that he mention to bring back the car industry for Japanese workers by using the car temporarily break out. But... OH MYGOD!! for the rest of the world. The most ridiculous point that the director didn't know he is a fascist one himself. By classing the people and choosing fates for them, by using Darwin theory of only the strongest (character) ones survive. He ignores the fact of millions are dying, he might save one or two. If only one character could have been saved by the other, it may prove love and relationship are real too, not just ghost. It makes audiences feel life is cheating them when the most selfish, ignorant ones are consider the most strongest and deserving people to live. By finance point of view, it's pretty good way to show investors that Japanese society is desperately need for emotional touching moments. Art in form of motion pictures needs budget injection, otherwise we off to oversea countries. But again, he failed to impress investors whom really consider profit is always the most important part by failing reach the climax horror moments in order to please the crowd. To make it worse the quiet and seem to be distance shadow of the friendly ghosts are really laughable. The director may cry for the lack of budget, but a shocking ugly evil face with shocking big bang sound could really do the tricks. With the FX in the end of the movie when our hero left the dead city, the director can't explain after a long intense period, she unfolded the mystery by seeing her friend's body was falling to pieces and flow away ..... inside a small room. It should happened with camera followed the run of the lead actress and zoomed away through the balcony to larger view of quiet and ghostly city. It doesn't only create more art element for the movie, but it also gives the audience a relaxing moment before going to final act. Then again, it's difficult to ask this Japanese director to have fun or even the meaning of recess. Coming to nature, public & charity services as solutions weren't once mentioned. And where is the family value which distinguish human being from other species? In conclusion, too much horizontal but lack of vertical directions. The director could do well in theater play but this product should had passed to some one with more Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch senses type of directors, not this visual effect out of date plus Hitchcock die hard/never grow up Manga fan director. One advice from a movie lover, Surreal only works in a realistic fashion.'\n",

Maybe it sounds plausible to anyone who doesn't understand wireless communication but I could not suspend my disbelief.The core part of the explanation is that they found \"frequencies they didn't know existed\" ?!!! There's no such thing. A frequency is a number. Any number is a potential theoretical frequency.Even if you consider that frequencies above the Planck frequency may not be physically possible, it would not be possible to even approach that frequency with the equipment they had. Once you get above a particular frequency, you're now dealing with the optical spectrum, visible light, not able to be produced by metal antennas and satellite dishes. And if the ghosts occupied these impossibly high frequencies and tapping into them meant they could now occupy lower, physically attainable frequencies, then there would be no \"safe zones\" just because there's no cell reception. They could occupy anywhere visible light could be seen... So there would be no safe spaces.If you want to make a sci fi premise, you have to occupy a space of science that is not well understood today, not a space as well known as the electromagnetic spectrum.'\n",

The video ends and the phone rings...but there is only an eerie silence on the other end. In seven days, the viewer of the video is dead, their heart having suddenly come to a stop for no apparent reason. One such victim is a seventeen year old girl, and it is up to her aunt, hotshot newspaper reporter Reiko, to solve the mystery of the strange video.Like the American remake \"The Ring,\" Ringu is not a perfect film. It leaves more than a couple of unanswered questions and may move too slowly in some parts to hold the attention of horror film fans who are used to a bloody slaughter scene every seven minutes. But for fans of good, spooky, old fashioned ghost stories, \"Ringu\" has a lot to recommend it.One of the things I appreciated the most about this movie is the complete and utter lack of gore. There's not a drop of blood to be found in this film, which makes the sight of so many dead bodies, their faces frozen in hideous screams of horror, all the more effective. The character of Sadako also has more of an impact than the child from the remake. Sadako never speaks, her face is never seen (but for one hideous, floating eye) and her presence is solid, unlike her static-y American sister. Sadako's emergence from the TV screen in the films final moments is worth waiting through the rest of the movie to see; it is a truly creepy moment which looks to have been filmed backwards as Sadako creeps with jerky, inhuman movements across the floor and up, swiveling to face her victim. That scene haunted me (no pun intended) for two full nights of broken sleep...mostly because Sadako seemed so terribly human, as sad as she was frightening. You pity her before you see her merciless side, and this throws the balance way out of whack.Unsettling, to say the least.This is a film about dread, about knowing that something dark and terrible is waiting for you and not knowing how to stop it. You can only wait and hope for the best...but the wait itself is the real horror, and the unseen unknown is the most frightening monster of all.'\n",

            "Review: 'In 2002, Dreamworks released a movie on American theaters called THE RING, by Gore Verbenski. It expanded to great lengths around the world. People claimed they had never been so scared while watching a movie in their entire life. Critics had mixed opinions of it, most for the better. But while the entire world was screaming to THE RING, others decided to reach out for the original version that Dreamworks decided to \"hide\" while THE RING was in it's theatrical run. The 1998 Japanese phenomenon RINGU (a.k.a RING.)\n",
            "Based on a 1991 novel by Koji Suzuki (claimed as the Japanese Stephen King) RINGU tells the story of reporter Asakawa Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a middle-class Japanese single mother. Her latest story is the investigation of a mysterious urban legend that circulates around high schools about a tape that kills whoever watches it seven days later. She learns that five teenagers recently died from a heart attack at the exact same time, and that they were all friends who spent a vacation on a cabin resort exactly one week before. It becomes up close and personal when she finds out one of them was her recently deceased cousin Tomoko (Yuku Takeuchi.)\n",
            "Reiko eventually tracks down and watches the mysterious tape, and in one of the movie's many chilling moments, receives a strange phone call confirming that the urban legend is true, an element that reminded me of the 1992's similar CANDYMAN. She finds help from her ex-husband Ryiuji (Hirouyuki Sanada), a psychic with paranormal powers (an element obviously removed from the US version). Both Reiko and Ryiuji examine the tape carefully and realize it was shot in a nearby volcanic island. With only a few days left, they travel to the island where the dark, disturbing truth remains hidden, waiting to be discovered.Taking liberties from the infilmable novel, director Hideo Nakata (DARK WATER, CHAOS) and screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi (DON'T LOOK UP) were able to create what is perhaps one of the most impressive horror films of recent memory, challenged maybe only by the less-subliminal AUDITION. Nakata's direction already explains what makes RINGU so unique: The absence of music, limited photography, simple camera movements, and no cheap jump scares. The fear in RINGU comes from skin-deep slow burn. If you are looking for jumps, watch the American remake instead. Which brings us to the infamous RINGU vs. THE RING internet battle: A pointless one.The 2002 remake had more technological resources and a stronger desire to freak out the audience. Director Gore Verbenski decided not to copy the original and went for a less subliminal more artsy Dario Argento dreamy approach with a Nine Inch Nails vibe and a David Fischer love for rain. While THE RING improved on the upcoming flaws of the original, it had problems of it's own. Not wanting to change the subject, let me tell you the Japanese version is the one to see. The problem is that most people who watch the recent remake will hate RINGU, and vice-versa.\n",
            "Unlike THE RING, RINGU avoids CGI shocks and cheap jump scares like a plague. You won't find any suspenseful moments, chases, or any physical struggles between the cast here. While the remake scared you with fast zooms, weird camera tricks, and inhuman freaky bursts of weird noises, RINGU scares you with it's lack of... sadism. A good example are the videotapes. The videotape seen in THE RING is a Nine Inch Nails video, in a good way, with very weird supernatural images and weird gross-out quick glimpses. The original's videotape is shorter and maybe even weirder. It shows you different but equally impressive images that belong to a David Lynch nightmare while a \"scratching\" noise is heard on the background. A noise that was unfortunately omitted in the remake. The Japanese tape can be either laughable or scary depending on the mentality of whoever watches it.\n",
            "But what makes RINGU the phenomenon that it is today is the character of Yamura Sadako, who turns out to be pulling the strings. Not wanting to spoil the plot, I will just say that never since Hanniball Lacter has a character with such little screen time terrorized the audience as good. The American doppelganger Samara was badly used in the remake. While what made Sadako scary was that she was pure evil, the remake's screenwriter Ehren Kruger tried to turn her into a Batman-like repressed character that you are supposed to feel sorry for. This terribly reduces the impact of \"the scene\". Which leads me to \"the scene\" itself. If you ask anyone who watched either version what \"the scene\" is, they will probably know. Let me tell you that \"the scene\" is done much better in this version. I will go as far as saying \"the scene\" is hands down one of the scariest moments in cinematographic history, very close to the shower scene and the climax of DON'T LOOK NOW. The remake tried to hard with it's own \"scene\", adding CGI effects, quick cuts, and many other gross-out elements that the original didn't need.\n",
            "But RINGU is not without it's flaws. Either the fact that I am not Asian, or maybe that I am not familiar with psychics, but the whole Ryiuji character left me wishing for more. Maybe the subtitle translation didn't make it clear enough, but I couldn't connect to that way he always had an answer to everything. Not that Sanada's performance is lacking. He steals the scene and carries out most of the movie. Remember Bruce Lee in GREEN HORNET? Maybe not, but that is Ryiuji here. And Matsushima is equally good, although she is given less to do than her American counterpart Naomi Watts. I will give credit to the US remake by eliminating the psychic subplot. I won't forgive the fact that Ryuji's American counterpart is a pointless and boring sidekick which is what ironically gives Watts her chance to shine.RINGU is still a superior horrifying experience that you will not easily forget. Forget the sequels (RING 2), forget the spin-offs (RASEN), the rip-offs (FEARDOTCOM), or remakes (RING VIRUS and THE RING). It all rounds up to here. Be sure to watch Nakata's equally good DARK WATER, which is already getting a remake on early works. Oh, the humanity...\n",

The Eye, Pulse, Audition, to name a few, are truly disturbing films that create horror out of objects or elements which are the farthest from the genre: a medical surgery to reestablish sight, the Internet, videotaping.With Ringu, Japan came into its own with a legitimate tale of horror which implies that the act of watching can actually kill you, and that evil can and will replicate itself through elements of our own technology as a means of feeding itself and thus, spreading itself out like a web. This is the secret within the film, and the theme which later on defines it (and the Ringu series).Ringu is not an excellent film. Far from it. But it does manage to instill a decent amount of atmosphere and eerie moments within its narrative (although there were scenes which, like the book, caused unintentional laughs, such as when the bodies of the two teens who first saw the video were taken out of the car and we are informed they were \"making out\"; and Ryuji's sudden revelation that he too has psychic powers) without resorting to cheesy special effects.

For the most part I agree that it is quite a bit, better than our version.  The story is basically the same as it revolves around a videocassette that kills anyone who watches it within a week.  Though in this version, the images on the tape seem to fit the circumstances better, and more is explained in this one as well...though not all of it, there are still things that are unanswered.  The atmosphere and mood of the movie are better than ours too, as the Japanese do not have constant music throughout, so there music cues make you a bit more edgy.  The story of the girl's parents in this one is better too, and there is this thing with ESP that is simply ignored in our version.  Here the father has ESP and that helps explain why the boy seems to have some sort of visions.  The cast does well in this one as I think the father in this one is better than the American version.  Though I did like the way the Ring looked in the American version more, and the scene where the boy told his mom that he shouldn't have helped the girl.  This one ends basically looking like it has a sequel in mind, and considering there is a sequel I would have to say I am right.

However for the most part it is just plain creepy  which is even worse.  There's no blood or gore  just a real sense of being uncomfortable.  The director has seen teen horrors before so he teases us  he has shots of people with doors just over their shoulder, or the TV lingering in the rear of the shot  knowing that we are conditioned to expect something to jump out  but then nothing does.  Instead the scares come slowly and blatantly really not being shocking but just making your skin crawl.The acting is superb all round although Sanada is a little stony at times but he gets better.  The real star is the director who uses music and sound effects to get the eerie effect but also uses images that are weird to just creep out the whole film.  I hope Hollywood directors learn what can be done with subtly rather than multimillion pound monsters or effects.I have said before that Fire Walk With Me was one of the creepiest films I've seen.

            "Review: 'Maybe the biggest and most popular Japanese horror film in recent years – certainly one of the few to garner world-wide attention and an immediate Hollywood remake – RING is a thoughtful, delicately-paced movie that suggests more than it shows. Like all such classic horror movies, the emphasis is on a creepy atmosphere and careful scenery building rather than violence or sudden loud crashes in the music. It's an atypical film, one which (like most of the 'new wave' of Asian horror films) requires a certain amount of patience to be able to sit through all the dialogue and scenes where nothing much in the way of action happens. But viewers are rewarded by plenty of splendidly creepy moments (as in the \"leave your lights on afterwards\" sense), which build to a genuinely suspenseful climax which even throws in a few twists to startle the viewer who believes he or she is ahead of the game.RING is a low budget film, but the lack of money helps rather than hinders the project. For a start the film seems realistic, shot in real houses instead of sets, and with actors who turn in accomplished performances as normal, everyday people. The slow pacing makes this feel like a documentary and it's actually refreshing to see a film without needless car chases and fancy FX sequences (unsurprisingly, these popped up in the US remake). Nanako Matsushima is fine as the journalist mother, forever neglecting her son, and the scenes requiring her to show fear are fantastic. Hiroyuki Sanada, one of my favourite Japanese actors of all time, is equally excellent as Matsushima's ex-husband, who also watches the videotape and finds himself desperately investigating the past in order to save himself, his wife and his son in the present.The videotape is always the centre piece of attention in the movie and the images we see on screen are deliberately thought-provoking, bizarre, abstract, almost dream-like shots which have the power to send a chill down the spine of the most stalwart watcher. The spooky bits get better as the film progresses: the interlude in the soggy well is a frightening set-piece although nothing happens, just the suspense of the situation is enough to make it work. The scenes involving the child apparition Sadako are superbly portrayed and should get a reaction out of the most hardened watcher. RING is a great movie that refuses to serve up a detailed plot line to the audience. Viewers are required to put thought and imagination into the film, in order to work out what is going on and to get the full effect. Those who do will surely agree that this is a successful, effective, quietly creeping horror classic that builds up the best sense of dread in any film I've seen.'\n",

            "Review: 'Ring was such a sensation on release that it led to a cycle of Japanese horror films. This Japanese invasion became known as J-Horror and they had quite an impact. Ring is a perfect example of why these movies were so effective. The cultural difference between the West and Japan meant that these films seemed somewhat unpredictable; some of the horror concepts and imagery were genuinely unsettling. We in the West could never have conceived of these ideas, they grew organically from Japanese culture. The unknown is often the scariest thing of all and the success of J-Horror is a perfect illustration of this.The basic idea of Ring is a clever combination of the traditional Japanese ghost story with modern Japanese technology. In it, a strange videotape curses anyone who views it, resulting in a terrifying death exactly a week later. It's an extremely creepy film that is truly unnerving at times. The pacing is very deliberate as we are taken through to the unforgettable final act. It's all about mood and atmosphere. It's quite economic with its shocks, relying more on mystery and growing tension. The key to the puzzle lies in the enigmatic weird video at the heart of the story. This bizarre short film leads the protagonists on a journey to discover the sinister secrets that underpin it. Strange details surround those who view the tape, such as the fact that their images in photographs become disturbingly warped. It's a highly effective central idea for a horror film.The visual presentation is very good, with some excellent cinematography. The sound design also works extremely well with the imagery on screen, adding to the ominous tone perfectly. On top of this there is good characterisation, which helps a great deal in giving the story an effective psychological edge. The husband and wife team are well played and believable; this makes their urgency in solving the mystery all the more pertinent. But nothing, I repeat nothing, can prepare a viewer adequately for Ring's one moment of true genius. Everybody who is reading this must surely know what I am about to refer to. I mean, of course, the moment when Sadako crawls out of the television screen. This must go down in the history of horror cinema as one of the most audacious and terrifying moments ever conceived. It's quite brilliant in concept and execution. The film may have been relatively subtle up to this point but after this scene perceptions of Ring suddenly and jarringly change. It's worth watching the movie for this scene alone.It was remade in America to much lesser effect as The Ring in 2002.'\n",

As she discovers that whenever a teenager spontaneously dies with a horrifying look on his face after hearing a supposedly killing videotape and one time the phone rings ,telling he had only one week to live . The TV reporter shows up to investigate these deeds . Reiko is helped by his ex-husband and later they face a race to save their lives from spooky creature . Reiko tries to get the bottom of mystery and discovers the secrets of life of Sadako and her father . Besides mysterious events are happening at home her husband and both of them are caught up by ominous Sadako.Based on original Japanese novel by Koji Suzuki , it was a real success in the Asian cinemas and all around the world . This horror film provides great load of screams, grisly killings and creepy atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister with the Sadako appearing . The picture is a sleek production with average budget by approx 1.200.000 dollars , and packs genuine chills , suspense, tension , and shocks , it's a terror-thriller very exciting . The film is paced with intelligent edition, special use of color and slick utilization of shock images . This frightening movie displays thrills , chills , hard-edged drama and ghastly images . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan . The movie has some special effects describing series of weird and otherworldly happenings and a magnificent make-up specially reflected on the hair-raising countenance of dead . Eerie musical score and tenebrous cinematography with the TV surrealist images filmed in 35 mm and in super 8 style . The motion picture is professionally directed by Hideo Nakata in similar style to Takashi Shimzu movies . Nakata is an expert on horror cinema with eerie phantoms of pale complexion and long hair and directed its following ¨Ringu 2 (1999)¨ ; furthermore he directed US version ¨Ring 2¨ with Naomi Watts. Of course ¨The Ring¨ followed its American version directed by Gore Verbinski whose argument copies exactly the Japan original movie without surprises.'\n",

            "Review: 'This movie was considerably hyped up, so I saw it eventually. My personal opinion is that this is more of a good mystery movie than a horror movie - it really wasn't that scary, to me at least. The only really scary moments were spoiled for me because I had already seen them before on things like \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\" on TV or something, and the notes by a critic inside the DVD box also spoiled it.Sound design was one part of this film that struck me - quite good at doing what it was supposed to, sometimes unsettling. I didn't feel a lot of character to be honest - just people making their way through the story.In my opinion, worth seeing just to investigate the hype, but don't expect to need a new change of underwear after seeing it. For that, you might want to consider The Grudge.'\n",

            "Review: 'Unlike some reviewers here, I'm happy to have seen Hollywood's 'The Ring' first. Now that I've seen both I would have to say that 'Ringu' is the better film (marginally).The Hollywood version was quite an unsettling experience in it's own right and having seen it first I rather expected 'Ringu' would be a 'ruined' experience as I was already familiar with the overall story and, of course, THE scene. After all, when the scene finally occurs in 'The Ring' the unexpectedness of it very much increases the shock of it. I hadn't been truly frightened by a scene from a horror movie for a very long time so I was unequivocally impressed.So when I got around to watching 'Ringu' my expectation was low. I assumed that the absence of surprise would diminish the experience greatly but, as it turns out, the difference in the styles (and some of the substance as well) was adequate enough to scare me all over again even though I thought I knew what to expect. Somehow I doubt that this would have been the case if I'd watched these movies in reverse order. I believe 'The Ring' would have been less enjoyable as it likely would have suffered from comparison.The familiarity actually served as a primer for watching the original. I've found that reading subtitles often detracts from the complete enjoyment of a film as one's appreciation of the visual content usually suffers from the distraction. In this case though, I found it to be less of a problem. Of course it certainly doesn't hurt to have the ability to rewind and in instances where I was unable to finish reading the dialogue completely you can be sure that I made use of it.The first difference that struck me was the teens found in the car. Like the girl in the closet in 'The Ring' their faces are frozen into grotesque masks, but the more terrifying aspect is that they have been 'gotten to' outside of their homes and all at the same time. This really drives home the realization that there may be no way to escape this thing. Safety in numbers? Nope. Don't go home? Nope, won't help.'Ringu' is somewhat more detailed in providing background than is 'The Ring'. The demonic child is shown in a scene that was omitted from the copied version and it adds a little something extra to our understanding of this terrifying entity. Also, I found that the valiant attempt to lift the curse by trying to 'free' the spirit from the well was more intense and claustrophobic (not to mention yuckier) than the American film.But what is it exactly that is so disquieting about both versions? Well, to begin with, the seemingly unrelated, disjointed and positively eerie imagery that is seen on the mysterious videotape really gets under the skin. The first time we see these we are troubled by the strangeness of them and thoroughly perplexed as to their meaning. We come to realize that a seed of uneasiness has been planted within us. The direction is masterful at nourishing this seed not only by showing short repeats of these images, but also by giving us incremental hints of what is still to come. We are briefly shown the well. Briefly again, the beginning of emergence. Briefly again, it's almost out. More and more I found myself getting cold shivers at each progression. The uneasiness is becoming dread.But there's something else that frightens apart from the film's construction. Is it the ultimate realization that this thing will not be placated no matter the heroic and well-intentioned efforts of the film's principal leads? Yes, that's an acutely chilling slant to be sure. But ultimately, I feel that the most disturbing element is that, were we to find ourselves in this position, we would be faced with a terrible choice - face the horror ourselves or deliberately inflict it on another. Escape it and you condemn your own soul. Now that's some scary sh*t'\n",

            "Review: '**CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS**Ringu is an unassuming little movie that my boyfriend and I rented from the local DVD store knowing little about it other than it had inspired a recent Hollywood remake.The first thing which accosts you when watching this film, is it's lo-fi documentary-style reality. Ringu has the look and feel production wise of a TV movie, but this only adds to the objective of it, to terrify.The story unfolds of an everyday Japanese single mother, the backdrop is nothing unusual but this is required as the bizarre begins to unravel before the eyes of the watcher. The woman has a child whom appears to be a strange little boy, and in many ways he parents her in her hectic schedule. Her ex husband is an amiable fellow, though he has an annoying quality to any female whom observes him which one assumes is the reason for the couple's politely handled split.The story takes a turn for the more macabre when a videotape emerges which is shrouded in urban myth. The short synopsis is you watch the tape and die within seven days of doing so. A group of teenagers inexplicably die, one of which is the niece of our leading lady. Being the plucky reporter that she is, she begins to investigate the eerie tape initially by watching it herself and embroiling her ex in this grim fairytale by seeking his counsel, on technical matters relating to the tape itself. The two find themselves in a race against time to discover the secret of the tape when their son watches a copy that was made.The bogeyman of this psychologically rattling outing, is Sada- a child or a demon?, perhaps a freak of nature? No answer is given and the viewer is left to their own conclusion and speculation. This reliance upon the viewers observational conclusion is what makes Ringu a truly adult horror movie above all others, we are not told what to think or moralised. Ringu simply displays the evidence on the nature of Sada, and leaves you to suppose whether she is a tortured victim cast from society, or simply a demon and nothing more.If the objective of any horror movie is to scare, then Ringu succeeds with flying colours. Everything about this movie is genuinely disturbing and unsettling. From the mythology of the tale to the ghastly contorted faces of the corpses that Sada, the demon of the story leaves in her wake.The grainy gritty production plays and builds upon anybody who dares to watch. The bittersweet relationship between the two leads encourages us to care about them and their plight. The story piques the curious child in all of us, and dares us to look when we should not, and tamper with things that are beyond our understanding.The absolutely heart ripping and bone chilling climax to this movie is unmissable. You will not be able to stop watching, but be wishing that you could rip out your eyes simultaneously!This movie is a quiet and unpretentious if imaginative little piece from Japan, which displays something that Hollywood has lacked in the horror genre in many years. The director has a true innate gift for knowing exactly what it is that we can not put our finger on that horrifies the human mind. This film is very Japanese, and I cannot imagine it doing well when converted to Hollywood form.Ringu is a movie made to be watched on your TV at home, exactly the way I did renting the DVD from your local store. This plays upon the very nature of the story. The TV is something we all think of as safe, it's in all our homes, and it is exactly this that adds such an overtone of terror to this particular filmAs an additional note, my boyfriend was flicking through the extra features on the DVD and came across the cursed video clip, and proceeded to watch it. I couldn't, I left the room. This fact serves as the best conclusion that I can muster as to the brilliance of Ringu. It is not to be missed, but do not watch it alone!10/10'\n",

            "Review: 'The Japanese original was the first exposure to the world of the cursed video tape I experienced. It is still my favourite and is one of the best horror films of all time (along with such classics as \"Don't Look Now\", \"The Exorcist\" and \"The Wickerman\"). Upon watching it for the first time it was a fantastic departure from all the usual Hollywood slashers that were filling multiplexes at the time, the story had a simple premise but a complex unravelling of the mystery. From the very beginning the film creates an unsettling mood, and raises many questions, but doesn't answer all of them which is fine by me. \"Ringu\" is also a brilliant display of restraint, as the film builds up slowly, taking its time (Slow and steady wins the race). Less is certainly more, and the low budget proves to be a blessing rather than a hindrance, as simple techniques are used and the audiences imagination plays a crucial part in creating the horror. All the performances are very impressive, especially by Nanako Matsushima, who really portrays a sense of urgency and fear in dealing with the super-natural. The departures from the novel never once hurt this adaptation, all the changes seem justified and work well in the context of the film, although the characters do not develop as much, they do have more involved relationships. As for that infamous finale, it is the most terrifying scene I have ever seen, and the practical nature of its set-up makes the film seem nothing more than realistically horrific. The film is a real trend setter, a lot of films owe it their thanks. The film is anything but 'in your face' and so don't watch it expecting the horror to slap you round the chops. Watch, listen and think. Some of the psychic sub-plots may seem peculiar to some, but I just love a bit of foreshadow and telekinesis. The film is also the best introduction to the mythology of The Ring, which is a very in depth and well rounded creation in either novel or movie form.'\n",

            "Review: 'The storyline is based around an Urban legend that involves a piece of footage that causes the eventual death of anyone having watched it. A female news reporter, Reiko Asakawa , investigates this case after her niece is the latest victim of the alleged curse. From here on, the film follows the female lead's search for clues as she races against time to find salvation. Caught up in the events is former husband, Ryuji Takayama , who possesses latent psychic abilities which come in handy later on as things start to spring to light. The film is made in typical Japanese horror genre style that plays on the mind as well as including sudden shock effects. Fans of urban legend type horror will take delight in this offering from director Nakata Hideo and whilst the film does lack substance somewhat, it makes up in suspense and mystery. You are also made to sit on the edge of your seat by the film's soundtrack which is disturbingly quiet, subtle and sinister. The atmosphere is the key part of the film that makes it a horror masterpiece. The story is cleverly written to move at a rate which keeps the audience interested and finally end in a twist that sets itself up for a sequel.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'd heard of Ringu, or Ring as it was called here, but didn't know much about it so when it was on television I decided to watch it, I'm glad I did as it is an excellent film. Unlike most horror films I've seen it didn't rely on shocks, gore and a high body count to scare the audience but instead was constantly creepy.The film opens with two girls talking about the rumour of a strange video which as soon as you've watched it the phone will ring and tell you that you will die in a week's time. Of course one of them says that she has seen the tape almost exactly a week ago. Soon she is dead, her face frozen in a look of terror. It then cuts to a female reporter who is interviewing school children about the legend of the strange video, she hears that is was first seen in Izu and some people who saw it died alone in their stationary car with no signs of foul play. She later discovers that they were friends of her niece who was the girl who died at the start of the film. She heads off to Izu and goes to the place they all stayed and finds the tape which she watches. The phone then rings and she realises she has one week to figure out how to break the curse. She goes to her ex-husband for help and together they examine a copy of the tape in detail which leads them to believe that the strange girl in the tape has some connection to the island of Oshima so they head there.There are of course other plot points but I don't want to spoil them all, especially the ending which really surprised me. I really enjoyed this film, the acting was very good in a low key manner, not the usual running around and screaming one would expect in a horror film.'\n",

Japanese population certainly knows that better than myself. But does the rest the world too? That I am not so sure, as the Americans, as usual, felt like they *had* to spoil another amazing movie with some fast-food remake.'Ringu' is rich and complete when it comes to the horror element. Yet, this isn't purely horror, there is a dramatic story behind this groundbreaking styling. Suspense and the feeling of horror are intense, almost of the type \"chilling to the bone\", but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't sleep at night, unless you are oversensitive on that matter.This is the disturbing story of a videotape that is bad to the bone - literally. And me saying this as if videotapes had bones! It's just a force of expression, so do not take it so literally. The basic idea of the film is pretty simplistic but works out fine.The artists do generally fine in their acting. While asians are clearly the sort of people who are noisy and can be either shy and reserved or the type who can't shut their mouth, they do perform pretty well, as this movie proves.This should definitely be on Top 250.'\n",

Originally I was going to watch the American version, but last second I decided I wanted to watch this version instead. I didn't really have any expectations for this to be honest. I knew it was supposed to be good, but that was it. I didn't watch any reviews or anything. I knew a good amount of the plot due to how the popular it is now, so, it was bound to happen. But wow, this was way better than I expected.The story is incredibly strong especially for a horror movie, but this isn't much of a horror movie (more on that later), but nonetheless, the story was great. The opening hooks you instantly, and gets you wondering what's going to happen. The mystery aspect is the best part of the story. There are a lot of questions that you want to have answered, and don't worry, they get answered, but the way we reach those answers is great. The tape is genuinely creepy, and adds another layer of creepy to the atmosphere, along with more mystery. Ringu moves at a very fast pace and hits all the main plot points with efficiency, but gives you time to breath and process what's happening, and that's a strong pro. Ringu is also a movie shrouded in mystery, especially with Yoichi and his dad. But as I said before, Ringu isn't a movie that leaves many questions unanswered, nearly every question is answered, which for some movies, especially horror movies, is quite rare.Now, this is a horror movie so how are the scares? Well, this is where I start to wonder a bit because very few scenes are actually scary, but there is still tension, lots of it. Many scenes are very tense and have you on the edge of your seat, and I appreciate that the tension comes from the fact that you are concerned with what is going to happen in the story, and not the fact that you are scared of a jumpscare or something scary happen. I wouldn't fully consider this a horror movie, but it still has some good creepy imagery, but all things considered, it's more of a mystery film.Now, the characters. With the 90 minute runtime, Ringu successfully sets up multiple characters for us to care for and be invested in. Ryuji is a very interesting character with a good amount of depth to him, and Reiko is a likeable protagonist who may not have the most amount of depth, you still root for and don't want to see lose.One of my other biggest praises is the cinematography. This movie is beautiful. So many shots are just serene and peaceful to look at while others are haunting and fill you with dread. The camera work is just overall very impressive. There are lots of shots that could have been done in more generic ways, but have a unique style to them that really adds to the movie. Especially the more close quarter shots, but of course, the more landscape focused shots are just as good, and are a nice feeling of peace, which is always nice to have in such a grim movie. The acting is also great. No performances are bad, and everyone seems to be trying their best, and it really shows because I found everyone to have a really good performance. The dialogue is also very realistic feeling, and is entertaining to watch. I never found there to be any lies that were cringe or out of place, or maybe just didn't land well. Overall, Ringu is an incredibly well-written movie.I'll be honest, all I knew about the Ring movies were some snippets of the American remake and the Ringu chapter in Dead by Daylight, but this blew my expectations away. Genuinely intense at times, had a great mystery and overall fantastic story, likeable characters, who had good mystery attached to them, a nice twist at the end, and AMAZING cinematography. This is for sure a must watch for horror fans, and people new to the genre because this isn't very scary, and had a massive impact on the genre. Highly recommend!'\n",

I sure watched it when it came out and remember being very impressed. but watching the original now, over a decade later I won't be able to compare the two.Which is fine since the original deserves to be treated like an individual movie. I can say for sure that it is a great movie and by now one can really say that it is a classic in the horror movie genre. It is one of the most successful Japanese horror movies that also started a big interest in the West towards Japanese horror.What makes this movie so great is that it is very atmospheric. The idea itself is original but not complicated. The atmosphere is very creepy and keeps one full of suspense. This is the better kind of horror than just some blood massacres.The suspense keeps a tight grip on the viewer and doesn't let one relax until the very end where we get some great twists that make the movie even more shocking and giving more room to imagine what comes next.The acting is not the major part of the movie where as I said suspense is what plays the greatest role. But the actors are really good fitting in with the mood of the movie. The one who causes all that horror is almost never on the screen and yet keeps the viewers terrified. Great work of art.'\n",

As well, most of the world trend to be a lot better at making horror films compared to the Americans, which is too reliance on slasher films.The premise of the Ring is there is a videotape which when another watches it they will receive a phone call telling them they only have a week to live, and guess what: after a week they die. When four teenagers from Tokyo watch the video and die on the same day television journalist Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) investigates it. She has a personal stake because one of those victims was her niece. She is a single mother, with a young child, but her works makes her life a juggling act. When investigating the cast she goes to Izu providence, just south of Tokyo and finds in the cabin the teenagers stayed in the tape. She watches it and receives a phone call afterwards. It before a race against time to figure out the mystery of the tape, and she enlist the help of her ex-husband Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada). Matters take even more urgency when they son watches the tape.It's a simple premise, but that's what you need in horror films. Unlike some horror films which rely on violence to get their message across, Ring has little violence. The director Hideo Nakata took a much more subtle approach, which was the right way to go. He did go for direct scares and it works. As well Nakata took great care about getting the atmosphere right, which is very important. It made you believe in the film and the characters. A nice light touch was making a film seem a little scratchy, like an old tape/film, adding to the film.Ring is creepy, and that's what you need.'\n",

(The three films I named aren't even in the same genre as one another.) Horror is what you get when you have a mercilessly cold universe, protagonists who are hunted, toyed with, and ultimately helpless ... and while vivid gore isn't an essential component, something akin to it is: we must see, at least once and preferably not too much more than once, the living human body reduced to the status of an inanimate slab of meat. (\"Ring\" conveys this bloodlessly, with the disturbing photograph, and with the villainess whose body moves oh so eerily, like a cross between a cheetah and a sack of potatoes.)  You can see why true horror films are by and large pretty poor affairs.  I'll admit I haven't seen the genre's two or three recognised classics (except perhaps for \"The Exorcist\", which is unquestionably good but only questionably horror), but until recently, the only one I thought highly of was \"Candyman\".\"Ring\" is considerably better.  Scary, no doubt, but also beautiful - there's a kind of sinister romance even in pearly-black, polymer-coated cameras and VCRs, and it somehow feels like the VERY SAME kind of sinister romance we detect in the calm open sea and the empty back alleys of a Japanese city.  There's a nicely shaped story, protagonists worth the effort of following (we can care for them even if we feel they're doomed), some mystery at the start, but not an overwhelming amount, and some residual mystery at the end, but not too much.  Perhaps the most refreshing thing about it is that it's got the guts to take itself seriously.My only quarrel is with the soundtrack, the \"shock\" moments being accompanied, for no better reason than to make us jump out of our seats, by loud noises (artificial, somewhat resembling the sound of a sword being pulled out of a metal sheath) that are neither representative of anything nor audible to the characters nor part of the musical score.  I think this is cheating.  But then, everyone cheats these days; no doubt many directors regard such noises as obligatory, like the whooshing sounds that accompany spaceships as they fly through empty space.  A pity a class act like \"Ring\" couldn't stand apart from the herd in this respect.  It does in every other. It doesn't need these noises, or any other, since its jolts are well enough engineered without them.  Watch \"Ring\" with a large crowd and you'll hear a lot of laughter - the tense, unconvincing laughter of people who were terrified out of their wits a second earlier.'\n",

Reiko is understandably reluctant to buy into the rumour, and as soon as she finds the tape down at a holiday cabin where Tomoko and her friends stayed a week before they all died, she watches it without hesitation. But then the phone rings, and Reiko discovers just how much truth there is behind the talk after all.

But that film is generally regarded as a rotting turkey of a motion picture, which leaves producer Takashige Ichise to give Suzuki's 'Ring' the proper treatment it deserves. To help him achieve this goal, Ichise has enlisted the help of filmmaker Hideo Nakata, who has just one film under his belt, 'Ghost Actress', which came out two years ago. At first, some may have reservations about a relatively inexperienced horror director helming a screen adaptation of what is actually more of a mystery than a thriller. But by the time those people have reached the final reel, their reservations will be sure to have been replaced by pure, undiluted fear. Because that's essentially what 'Ring', in Nakata's hands, has turned out as: an unrelentingly terrifying film, that will have you on edge around your television set for days to come.Nakata hasn't much of a budget to work with, but makes the most of everything he has, and constructs each scene with impressive precision. Nakata is certainly a tease, inserting slightly open doorways or shadowy corners into the background of almost every shot. But rather than satisfy the audience with a multitude of \"jump\" scares, he instead leaves them writhing in agony, using each moment of the film to summon up a palpable sense of impending dread. Nakata also tinkers with the sound design to great effect, but thankfully does not lazily fall back on scratching violins and close-ups on corpses to shock the audience.And at the same time, 'Ring' is also just as creepy when everything is dead silent, with nothing going on except the main story right in front of you. Nakata is eager to thrill the audience, but never interferes when he doesn't need to, and only releases the tension when the time is absolutely right. It has to be noted, however, that the lighting of certain scenes does seem to be non-existent at times, causing the large dark areas bleeding into the screen to actually irritate the mind rather than chill it, but for the most part, cinematographer Junichirô Hayashi's work here is the stuff of nightmares. As is an exemplary orchestral score by Kenji Kawai, which will send shivers down your spine from the moment the opening credits sequence starts. Nakata has now proved himself as a maestro of horror movies (or at least this one), but I'm tempted to hate him for it; 'Ring' got under my skin so much that I almost wanted the film to just stop.Nakata hardly relies on star Nanako Matsushima for 'Ring''s quality control, but her performance is nevertheless worthy of note. The actress is the focal point of interest during the calm before the storm, and she handles her role sublimely, reacting well against Hiroyuki Sanada, who is also quite good, but his character is a little too cold and gruff for my liking. It's Matsushima who provides the emotional heart of 'Ring', and you'll be behind her character every step of the way.While 'Ring' as a whole is considerably frightening, the final few scenes (where the seven days are up) are perhaps the most unnerving of all, with echoes of David Cronenberg's 'Videodrome', and a parting shot borrowed from 'The Terminator'. I don't mean to overly praise it, but 'Ring' is more of an intense experience than an actual film, and the horror becomes amplified by the unexpected twist ending, which paves the way for an immediate follow-up. 'The Spiral' (based on Koji Suzuki's sequel novel), comes out at the same time as 'Ring', and I look forward to seeing it, but am also disappointed that Nakata was not involved in its making. At this point, Nakata seems to be the best, and only, man for any 'Ring'-related job. Why? Well, many reasons, but like I said, you'll be wary of your television set for quite a while.~ 9/10 ~'\n",

            "Review: 'The original movie that the Hollywood-based hit The Ring is based on, Ringu is tons creepier and scarier, with better acting, better production, better script, and better everything.Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) is a newspaper reporter who is learning about a cursed videotape: after viewing an odd video, a phone rings, and the person on the other end says, `You have one week to live.' After her niece dies from, presumably, the tape, she decides to investigate, so she gets a hold of the video and watches it. She, along with her husband/boyfriend Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), dissects the tape frame by frame and tries to figure out the mystery.This is the only movie that kept me up at night and had me terrified at night, which is odd because the American remake is basically the same, except that Ringu is in every way better. The video is shorter, and many things, such as flies, bloody noses, drawing rings, and shading faces, are not in this version, mainly because it wasn't necessary. Those were just to American-ize it. Also, the character played by Brian Cox in the remake has a larger role in this one. I did not `jump' once, while in The Ring, that seemed to be most of the scares. This one got its thrills naturally, not cheaply.Hollywood movies seem to have booming music throughout the entire films, while Ringu only had music during the suspenseful scenes, which is odd, since, to me, the entire film was completely suspenseful. The ending, with the TV, was the same as The Ring, but it still gave us more answers than the remake, and didn't give us any unnecessary information (such as the horses dying). It did not seem over the top, in fact, it actually seemed plausible? It had to have palpable dread to get me this scared. There also was a lot with ESP, while there was none with the remake, which I unfortunately had to see first.Matsushima was very good, she really acted well. I hope that Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 get released here in America so I can see more of her work, since she was very good. Sanada was also very good, and another standout is Rikiya Otaka (Yoichi, Reiko's son). He seemed to have ESP too, and was great. His role seemed very demanding for such a young age.I would recommend seeing Ringu before The Ring because: it's better, the ending would be more of a surprise, and it's scarier. One more point: why is it called Ringu if there isn't a ring in the video? You won't notice if you're constantly biting your nails when watching, which is what you'll do.My rating: 10/10Not Rated'\n",

So you get a lot of Western ignorance, and a big lack of subtle appreciation (though you get lots of people trying to prove how intellectual they are(n't) too).This film is a low-budget masterpiece, and terrifying. As somebody who mainly watches SF, Mystery, occasionally Fantasy, and a lot of Horror, I have a good basis for my opinion.I'm writing this review because of my annoyance at umpteen foolish reviews trying to say the American remake had any merit at all (it was a laughable, boring, stupid disaster, as it could only have been), and that this film was somehow 'overrated'.'Overrated', hm?I think the truth is that when something really scares little adult children, badly, they hasten to put it down and belittle it. Including in print, and online.'Not scary at all.' 'People call this scary?' 'Didn't frighten ME!'This indeed is a very scary, very well acted, beautifully put together, little cinematic nightmare. I've seen it several times, and it stands up. Its own sequel is also very good (the 3rd, the prequel, is ok, but we don't ever talk about the 4th).I think Ring was only ever topped by Dark Water.(Oh, and it was never called Ringu, but that myth seems to have stuck so here we are.)'\n",

            "Review: 'The 1998 Japanese thriller \"Ringu\" has turned out to be that country's most successful horror film of all time, spawning a series of movies over there as well as here in the U.S. I have not seen the American remake, but word on the street has it that the original is the one to go with, and since I've seen very few remakes that could compare to their original (1941's \"The Maltese Falcon\" being the most notable exception), I would tend to agree. I CAN tell you that \"Ringu\" is one extremely effective modern-day ghost story. It involves a mysterious videotape that spells the death of anyone who watches it, and the beautiful journalist (Nanako Matsushima) who investigates the background of said tape. It is a fascinating, involving story, which sometimes plays out like a police procedural, but with at least a 9.7 on the Creepometer. Eerie sound effects and music constantly keep the viewer primed for shocks, and although there is no real blood or violence to speak of, there IS a constant air of menace and dread. Many scenes will remind the veteran horror fan of other classic film moments: the supplied dates (e.g., Sunday, September 5th) with accompanying gonglike noises reminiscent of \"The Legend of Hell House\" (1973); excavating under a building for the bones of a dead child, like in \"The Changeling\" (1979); and the whole \"teens in jeopardy from an urban legend\" setup, from everything from the Freddy Krueger movies to \"Candyman\" (1992). I'm not sure whether all the pieces hang together in \"Ringu,\" or if all our questions are answered, but I DO know that this film does indeed scare! Be sure to take the phone off the hook while watching this film; if it should happen to ring, you just might jump through the roof! And look out for that TV crawl-through scene!'\n",

But that's not the reason, even though `Ringu` was a bigger hit in Japan than `Ring` in the US.The reason is that the US screenwriters apparently did some thinking about the matter, and what works. In the original, the emphasis is on the girl and her ability to psychically connect. In the remake, the emphasis is on the evil in the tape itself. That tape acts on its own; the girl is a result, opposite from the cosmology of the Japanese version. The remake supported this in many ways. Remember the fly which moved from within to without and why? Remember all the extra visual meaning the remake added to the tape, like the tree? Remember how the Dad had his own collection of video equipment?That's because it is a whole lot spookier to be watching a movie and be convinced that movies themselves can be evil. American kids are remarkably sophisticated in this sort of self-reflection (though they stupidly call it irony, go figure).

While \"The Excorsist\" was entertaining and nice, and \"the Shining\" was both hilarious (Jack Nicholsson) and effective, no horror movie I've ever seen has been as unsettling as Ringu.Nothing much happens compared to a western horror piece, where the director often spends a lot of time explaining and making things dumber for the broad audience, and squeezing in as much scary stuff as he can within the time frame. Ringu let's you think and make assumptions yourself, and doesn't assault your eyes with jump-scenes. Even though I had a rough picture of the plot, it was very tense and I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the climax.The climax was nearly unbearable to watch, not only because it was scary, but because the mood had built up to that one scene. It was masterful. The actors where good even though I cannot really compare since I don't watch a lot of Japanese movies.The movie is worth seeing, but not if you've seen \"the Ring\" first.

            "Review: 'There's something to be said about the strength of good, eerie, slowly- paced horror. Especially in a day and age as we are now, where horror is misinterpreted by filmmakers as loud, lazy jump-scares, buckets of gore, and nubile girls running around in next-to-nothing, fleeing from deranged murderers. There's something almost immediately admirable and exciting about a horror film that eschews these more modern (and decidedly not scary) tactics, and instead respects its audience, using atmosphere, a slowly building pace, subtlety and well-developed characters to draw us into a pervasive, overwhelming sense of dread.Think about some horror classics: John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" (or even more effectively, his remake \"The Thing\"), Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", Peter Medak's \"The Changeling\", etc. They all were respectful, subtle films that didn't rely on cheapness and laziness like so many other modern horror films. And I do believe that Hideo Nakata's \"Ringu\" (or \"Ring\"), a 1998 Japanese horror film inspired by the novels of Koji Suzuki, belongs on a list with those classics. It is a powerful film for it's quiet nature, subtle storytelling and well-developed characters, and they are what makes it so effective and frightening. (Although tragically, it's most recent sequel, \"Sadako 3D\" does eschew the classic, subtle storytelling for a more messy modern affair... more to come on that train-wreck in a later review.)We follow Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter who is investigating an increasingly popular urban legend regarding an alleged \"haunted video\", which supposedly causes the death of all who see it. After probing the recent death of her niece, Reiko decides to retrace their last few days, and discovers a mysterious video-tape in a cabin they had rented. Realizing that the urban legend of the haunted tape is true, Reiko and her ex husband Ryugi (Hiroyuki Sanada) are forced to try and solve the mystery of who created it and how to stop it.The performances are fantastic. Matsushima as our lead is brilliant and very well-developed, and is able to show both strength as well as draw the audience's sympathy. (Plus my piggish side does have to admit she is very easy on the eyes) Sanada shows a lot of talent and intensity as Ryugi, and he is able to balance well with Matsushima with their good chemistry on-screen. And other performances, including Rikiya Ōtaka as Yoichi, the son of Reiko and Ryugi, are all very well-played and elevate the film quite a bit. It's a phenomenal cast.Nakata's direction is quite a sight to behold. It's very subtle, simplistic and direct, which actually makes it all the more unsettling. He doesn't go out of his way to highlight the horror, or present the monsters with dramatic camera angles and musical stings- scenes are staged and shot simply, and it makes every feel very real. You get a sense that anything can happen at any time, causing non-stop dread later in the film. The script by Hiroshi Takahashi is fantastic, slowly building the tension and developing the characters over the 96 minute run-time in a way that puts many other films to shame, and makes us not only care about everyone, but have a very real, human fear for their safety.The rest of the production is fantastic and very true-to-life. The set design is great, giving us a world that feels like the same one we live in. Costume design is simple, real and effective. The editing is top- notch, giving us a slow-build. And the musical score by Kenji Kawai is amazing. It's very minimal, and only comes in when it's needed, giving us an occasional spine-tingling violin shriek, or an eerie scraping of strings in the background.\"Ringu\" is easily not only one of the best horror films to come out of Japan in the past 20 years, but it's easily one of the best horror films worldwide to be released in the past 20 years. And it's cultural impact (spawing so far four sequels in Japan, an American remake and sequel, and countless other works inspired by it) is something to behold. I do believe that 50 years from now, it will still be looked at as a fantastic accomplishment in horror filmmaking. The only thing I don't like about it is one particularly bad sound-effects choice that caused me to laugh out loud during a fairly crucial moment (A cartoonish sound that comes near the end and sticks out like a sore thumb), but even that cannot diminish the film in any way whatsoever.\"Ringu\" gets a perfect 10.

            "Review: 'Series Note: There are many different films, television series, books, comic books, etc. based on the \"Ring Universe\", and it's very complicated trying to sort them out. While this film was the first released and is considered the \"grandfather\" of the Japanese series, there was a prequel released in 2000 named Ringu 0: Basudei (Ring 0: Birthday). Depending on your preferences, watch this film first for \"maximum mystery\", or if you like a more chronologically linear story, as I do, watch the prequel first. In either event, you should follow this film with either Rasen (aka Spiral, 1998), which was the original \"Ring 2\" (and which more closely follows the second novel), or with the \"official\" Ringu 2 (1999).---------------------------------------At the same time that some teens are turning up dead, a rumor is going around that the deaths are correlated to a mysterious piece of video, sometimes seen on videotape, but rumored to also be broadcast. If one sees the video, one receives a call telling them that they will die within a week, and it's not an idle threat. Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) is a television news reporter doing a story on the rumors about the video. When her niece mysteriously dies, she happens upon evidence that links her niece and the videotape story, including seeing the tape and receiving a call herself. Can she, with the aid of her ex-husband, Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada), get to the bottom of the story before her time is up? The bad news for the \"anti-Hollywood\" crowd is that I don't think this version of the Ring is as good as Gore Verbinksi's 2002 remake. The good news is that this is still a quality film, and it is imperative viewing for anyone interested in the Ring mythos, which has become quite extensive over the years.There are two reasons why I feel this film is inferior. The first is that it is constructed mostly as a straightforward, linearly logical \"detective story\", but keeps wanting to go back to a more surreal plot--the two never quite mesh. The detective story at times has an almost Hitchcockian feel, which is certainly an asset, but that invites a meticulously analytical attitude from the viewer, in the midst of which we're given more typically Asian (and European) horror film dream logic. For example, it's not quite clear what happens to some characters; often events just happen \"out of the blue\". And the rules of the curse--especially the telephone call aspect--are never quite clear, either.The second problem is that director Hideo Nakata makes most of his revelations too easy for his characters--a lot of suspense is lost because more often than not, the answers just fall into their laps. If we're in mystery/thriller/suspense mode, we need to not have characters figure out the references from the videotape so quickly, for example. We also need them to not figure out the geographic source of the curse so easily.Also, at least in the DVD pressing I have, the picture quality is horrible, with the darks frequently being too black to make out the action, there are lots of dirt and scratches on the print, which isn't very crisp, and so on. This latter problem is probably not due to bad cinematography, but a lousy import edition (so I didn't subtract any points for it).But the film has two facts strongly in its favor--strong enough to recover at least one point lost to the flaws above. One, the basic idea of the story is simply enchanting. Two, Nakata is good at building subtle atmosphere.The success of the story is easy to discern from the legions of films that have been influenced by the Ring in some way, including FearDotCom (2002) and Ju-On (2000)--and these within only a few years. Beneath the surface, the story stems from deeply rooted urban legends and fears that one can be cursed or hexed by a malicious person in some way. On the surface, the film is creepy because of its inscrutable mystery (and again, this is felt strongest if you watch this film before the others, at least on your first cycle through the films), aided by the ingenious device of the enigmatic videotape. As the mystery is delved into, it becomes disturbing for \"the facts behind the case\", rooted as they are in taboos, incomprehensible injustices and possibly intimately tied to supernatural beings.Nakata gradually takes us from innocent teens in an at least functional slumber-party mode to a strongly metaphorical descent into hell, which is then unwittingly brought back up to the surface. Although he and scriptwriter Hiroshi Takahashi (basing his work on Koji Suzuki's novel) touch on a lot of horror clichés along the way, such as teens getting killed while having sex, they more often circumvent the banal. We don't even meet the \"villain\" for almost an hour and twenty minutes, and of course it shouldn't be any sooner. The key to the film is gradually circling the entrancing mystery, with terror being a factor of a face-to-face counter with the unknown and inexplicable.Most of the horror in the film is extremely subtle and bloodless. This is an excellent example of how the genre can be realized in our contemporary era without relying on gore or over-the-top violence. Of course, it's not that I mind gore and over-the-top violence, but I like variety.'\n",

As is the case with most Asian horrors, especially the earlier films of the recent batch, the director does not make the plot too obvious to the viewer. You have to watch closely and decide a few things for yourself. I must admit I really enjoy this aspect of Asian films, you have to work at it, as opposed to the usual spoon-fed Hollywood story lines. There are some major differences between Ringu and Ring, the father is psychic, which makes sense, there are less jumps and telegraphed shocks, but the same dank, dirty atmosphere is there in both films. It is not a perfect film. It obviously lacks the budget of Ring and there are patches when nothing much happens which is difficult for an audience fed on constant periodic shocks. Asian cinema has a different pace, there are points of quiet, leading to out of the blue shocks. This actually increases the tension of the film, leading up to one of the most terrifying climaxes possible. Once you have seen the ending you will wish you hadn't, as you cannot watch it fresh again. A great film that is perfect for TV viewing, excellent acting throughout, with possibly the best ending of any horror film.'\n",

Whether it is better or not remains in question, but what is not in question is the quality of this film.  The film starts out with some nice tension from the beginning and carries it out till the very end.  The Ring seems to be a scene by scene copy of this film till about two-thirds of the way, and then it makes some noticeable detours.  I find that I enjoy both story lines equally.  This film has some stellar acting and some very memorable scenery. What I did like about it was the differentiation of Japanese life from city to countryside. The film showcases the differing values and lifestyles with ease and strength.  Ringu is also a beautiful film.  The much talked about ending DOES seem to assume a sequel and DOES answer more of the viewer's questions.  I heartily recommend watching this shortly after seeing The Ring.'\n",

Sadako is a scary but tragic figure, a victim of greed and exploitation. She seeks revenge for all those that did her wrong. Trapped in a dark damp well for many years she waits for that day when she'll escape from her prison. I actually enjoyed this film. The direction well good, the storyline made sense and the acting was above average. A few cultural differences aside, the movie had an aura of realism. You can view this film is many different aspects. I have read Ringu and there are many differences. But I like the changes that they made.The scares are genuine and the soundtrack is excellent. Highly recommended. This is the film that raise the bar in horror films. Often imitated by never duplicated (the American version noted).

There are certain implications made earlier in the tale that contribute to an overall circular motion, a ring that has no bottom and no top, an endless chain of events (for the record--yes, I know the Ring of the title refers to the ring of the telephone after the tape is viewed but there is still this aspect of completing-the-circle in the story structure); certain unsettling questions are left to the viewer to ponder afterward and this is a good thing. Listen, for example, to Yoichi's explanation as to who told him to watch the tape (the implication being that death is not necessarily the end for Sadako's victims); note also the hooded figure in the video and its reappearance near the end of the film and the name to which the heroine assigns to it (the question here is along the lines of whether certain events were preordained from the start)....all of this is interesting stuff to mull over. Told with simplicity and economy, Ringu is superior to the American remake -- in itself still a good thriller but one short on subtlety -- a textbook example of Japanese horror at its most inventive and frightening.'\n",

            "Review: 'Such was the cult-like swelling of appreciation around this picture, that I was surprised to discover that in terms of effect and ambition it was at best a variant of 'The X-Files'.  A particularly good, intelligent, eerie X-File, maybe, with an excellent sense of narrative, but an X-File nonetheless.  In the West at any rate, it does not have the same impact as the movie it's been most compared to, 'The Blair Witch Project' - 'Ring''s exquisite formalism (in direction, plotting and acting) is in contrast with the compelling contrived naturalism of the American film, its roots in America's past, folk legends etc.  The disparity between the Michael Haneke-like clarity of the image, and the various traces that can be made out - a reflection on a window, the glow of a lamp - is where the real chill is.It is a cliche that the horror movie puts on the surface those things a society would rather not acknowledge - 'Ring' takes this literally, the source of its horrors being a young woman buried alive in a well.  The repressed traumas that Japan is hiding, then, on the basis of this film, is the old, conservative past.  It is surely significant that the victims are all 'morally suspect' - the teenage friends who go out of town for presumed sexual licence; the daughter of a mother who isn't in the home.  The heroine is an independent single mother who leaves her son at home for alarmingly long patches.  The new Western liberalism taints everyone.The new capitalist Japan is not even as we might imagine it from received opinion - there are few teeming streets, noisy traffic jams, bright neon signs, consumer overload, towering skyscrapers.  This is very much a quiet, minimalist Japan, of large empty rooms filled with dread, of quiet empty streets.  All everyday sound is magnified to seem hyperreal, threatening. All absences betray the expectation of a malevolent presence. Old Japan is very much alive in the elaborate, formal religious rituals, but in this film they are funeral rites, linking the traditional to death, and it is this suppressed tradition that returns from the dead.  After all Sadako is killed by an adulterer.  It is also the revenge of forgotten provinces on Tokyo, the regional infecting the metropolitan, nature fighting back artifice, history versus post-modernism.  Women, though, are always witches.  Plus ca change.Of course, the curse is disseminated by modernity's most sophisticated and pervasive mode of communication, TV, itself a museum of the dead, especially late at night, when Sadako strikes, along with all the old movies and forgotten stars.If 'Ring' itself seems rather smallscreen, the little curse-movie is a masterpiece - part-Bunuel, part-Dreyer, with its hair-brushing woman, characters teeming like an insect hive, crawling men, hooded votaries, incredibly symbolically-loaded well, it is easily the best film I've seen all year.  This makes the potentially risible denouement, as Sadako emerges from the TV, so poignant, as she jerks like old scratchy film.'\n",

The film initiated global interest in Japanese cinema in general and Japanese horror cinema in particular, a renaissance which led to the coining of the term J-Horror in the West. This \"New Asian Horror\" resulted in further successful releases, such as \"Ju-on: The Grudge\" and \"Dark Water\".This really is the essential modern Japanese horror film. Not only did it launch a cycle of American remakes and get more people to notice Japanese horror, but it is terrifying in its own right. Some have tried to analyze it as a metaphor on motherhood or being about traditional Japanese culture. But really, it was just scary... and still is almost 20 years later.'\n",

I can't really say which version I enjoyed more because I thought both worked perfectly well for the horror genre. I'd say this one here featured better direction and performances. I thought the two lead performers here gave really good performances as well. What I find most different in these Japanese and their American remakes is that the foreign films go for a calmer scare factor. It seems the American version of this and Ju-On: The Grudge went for a lot of scares by using loud sound effects that would make anyone jump. It seems the American films go for a money shot while the Japanese films go for a slower scare factor. It doesn't really feel like the film is working but then you notice that you're all curled up on the couch totally caught up in the film.

The result is the most terrifying movie of the decade, and one of the most chilling movies of all time. Made on a tiny budget the film is relentlessly evil, the tension never gives in, and you will not forget it for the rest of your life. Stylish, borrowing from other films and surpassing them Ringu is a demon reincarnated as a movie, its effect on us everlasting, ensuring we spread the word- you must see this movie...The film opens with a Scream-like scene and the tension is already high, our wrists put in a deathly grip from the outset. Two teenage girls are discussing a video one of them claims to have seen, saying it is the scariest thing she has ever see. Once you watch it the phone rings, and a voice tells you you will die in seven days. The girl though says she is joking. Then the TV switches itself on and she hears scratching noises. It has been seven days. We cut to a reporter, Reiko Asakawa who is doing a story about the video curse. She investigates some local deaths, including her niece and soon realises that all her niece's friends are dead too, having watched a mysterious video. Leaving her son behind she goes in search of the video. Eventually she finds it, watches it and answers the ringing phone. Convinced she is going to die she contacts her ex-husband and tries to find a way to save herself. He is not convinced, and watches it as well. However, later that night their son Yoichi also watches, so they all try to solve the curse, uncovering the story of the Yamamuras, in particular- Sadako.Aside from having one of the most frightening moments in movie history, one which the remake completely failed to resurrect, there is an eerie atmosphere throughout the film. There are many other scary moments all adding to the atmosphere and building towards the infamous final scare. The last 15 minutes are extremely scary as Reiko and Ryuji search for Sadako and feature some of the best filmed scenes in horror history. Everything in the film is designed to unsettle- the unearthly soundtrack reminiscent of Argento's Goblins, the fixed and cornered camera angles so we can never see what is near, the grim surroundings, the complete lack of humour, the use of colour etc. The performances are all very good as well, Nanako Matsushima as Reiko swiftly moves from confident to frantic wreck, and exudes every possible emotion. Hiroyuki Sanada is extremely strong, slowly coming to realise the truth, conveying guilt over his son and remaining both mysterious and strong when his ex-wife gives up. His final scene is perfectly acted, heightening the overall effect.Rikiya Otaka as Yoichi manages to be creepy, but his role becomes more central in the second film. The rest of the cast are all immensely good. The inclusion of the timer is also highly effective, ensuring the tension rises as we know time is running out.Of course the film has its flaws. Some people will be put off by the slow nature. Some people will feel the need to have every question answered, and Ringu leaves many unanswered-that is the point. If we were in this situation we would be looking for answers-anything to help us, to relieve the fear, something real to hold on to, but nothing is given. As we are left wondering, the film will stay with us, continuing to haunt us over time, ensuring we do not escape the ring. As it was adapted from a novel, certain inherent difficulties arise. In the novel it is a man who is the reporter, his wife is barely around, and his near-sadist friend takes up the Ryuji role, hoping to put some excitement into his life. In the book, beware all reflective surfaces. The curse is more of a disease than a ghost. Nakata takes the best elements, and makes the story his own. There will be some confusing moments, but the constant threat of something happening will mean you will continually be focused on the film.The sense of isolation is strong, and there is a coldness surrounding the film. Many rooms are blank, place lack expression, and people speak in monotone, and avoid contact. Nakata explores Japanese culture and mythology, showing the intrusion of the West via moments which remind us of past films. There is more than one reference to The Terminator- the final shot, the dates, the relentless evil of Sadako, technology backfiring, and it recalls other films such as Videodrome, Eraserhead, Straw Dogs, and there is veiled thanks to Stephen King. (Translate the name of a certain familiar Stephen King town into Japanese). Nakata shows himself to be the new master of tension, and along with Miike, Kitano and others is proving that Japanese cinema is a force not to be taken lightly. I first saw this around 5 years ago, and it is still rewarding and scary today. The themes of abandonment, fear and guilt stay with the viewer, coming out more with each viewing, once the initial fear has gone. This is one horror movie everyone should see, vastly superior to the remake which opted for cheap scares, flashy camera-work and loud noises. This is subtle, both nightmarish and real, and uses one of the most effective themes of horror movies to the fullest- the inevitability of death. We are doomed and there is no escape, but that should not stop us fighting for each other and ourselves, no matter how invincible our enemy.10 out of 10'\n",

While I was not familiar with the actors and actresses, the reason I thought the movie was real good was because of the plot and the general cast of the movie. The English title was called the Ring here, and I thought it had something to do with an actual ring that you wore around your finger. Only after the movie started did I realise that the ring it wass referring to was a human chain-ring, instead of a chain letter, this was somewhat like a chain-video. As the movie progresses, we are not allowed to see how the actors die while watching the movie, which makes it more ominous than it already is. When we finally get to see what's on the video, it was so spooky I unconsciously felt goosebumps rising, even though I am one who is very rarely scared by horror movies.This is one movie you might not want to watch alone at home in the dark, just in case the video you are watching turns out to be the one in the movie. ;)'\n",

Anyone who found that movie or The Exorcist boring to watch, don´t bother to see The RING because you won´t like it. But if you want your horror stuff creepy and atmospheric with a good plot and a good, but slow build up of tension, then this is THE movie to see.And don´t be surprised by the fact, if that by the middle of the movie you´re asking yourself, what the hype was all about. I know, it´s creepy, but it doesn´t look that particulary scary in a classic terrifying way, untill...Untill you reach the ending with the tv scene.

One pattern, I've noticed lately is to take a good, lesser-known, foreign made film and churn out a Hollywood version to make a quick buck. I have mixed feelings, because on one hand they are somewhat unnecessary, while still some of the recent remakes have been quality movies, like Insomnia. I prefer to see the original first, but it doesn't always work out that way. Ringu is a quality original story that is well directed and acted. It should be seen, but a lot of U.S. movie goers will never know about it and assume The Ring is an original film, while in reality it is just a slightly Americanized version with a few more jump cuts thrown in.\n",

            "Review: 'Before my commenting any further, I must notify anybody that wants to watch `Ringu' you must first identify with the Japanese films rhythm. Appealing to the American style, Japanese will look slower on the pace and more reliable on the situation and the atmosphere it builds. So if you already throw away your American style expectation, then you can embrace this film with the good mood. If not, you'll find it boring and annoying (and incoherent crap, silly, or makes no sense!) Let's not talk about the plot, because it seems nowadays it already is well-known. Many people said it's a horror movie and I agree with them, but basically, it's a pure psychological-drama about a certain terrifying situation, which could happen to anybody (including you!). The plot development is structured and makes it feel good and overwhelming. There's no stutter or gaps that can annoy the film's pulse.  The plot itself is simple (and really not trying to make an abundant cliché to scare you much). The eerie situations are not excessive and make it easier to pleasant. One thing that you must understand here is the film is not trying to scare you in an overacting way or frighten you in a gross blood bath (if that the term of horror movies by you!), but to make you realize that living is full of circle and your life is like a ring. I don't mind if you insist to have some creepy moment from those splatter instead. But what you could get from it anyway? Now, after you dive on its deep, you will feel satisfied for watching it. Of course it has it own absurdity and holes, but `Ringu' definitely is a well-done alternate product that manages to entertain in a good way. It's highly recommended for the fans of drama or (the true meaning of)horror. 8/10'\n",

But as usual, the movie and its sequels were madeavailable in pirated VCD format and became an instant classic. Itssuccess was phenomenal, something to the equivalent of 'EvilDead' in the West. In S. Korea, it was re-made into Ring: Virus, itspawned several copycats in Hong Kong and many parodies overthe Internet.If you ever lived in SE Asia, you would eventually find out that it is adisturbing region with a long bloody history. Consequently many ofus grew up with stories, factual and fictive, of what in the Westmight be considered as ghost stories. Not surprisingly, many ofour ghost stories also relate to ancient villages' wells or hauntedforests and apparitions of a slim lady in a long white dress, herface covered by long black hair. The stories were told for generations in different versions andlanguages, but regardless of the divisions of nationalities, Ibelieve, we share a psychological fear of similar spirits andentities that we learnt to live with, through those stories.\n",

He avoided goreand blood and relied more on suspense and our own imaginations.The shots of vernacular oddities: the wells underneath the foresthostel, the earthquake, the dimly-lit corridors, the beautifullyfrightening lady in the mirror, etc. But any more applaude shouldgo to the writer of the novel, Suzuki Koji, who cleverly binds ourtraditional ghost stories with modern artifacts (videos and TVs)into a chain-reaction of curse.

            "Review: 'Despite the conflicting opinions of the American version of The Ring...I think I am still have nightmares. It was downright terrifying. Hands down the scariest, creepiest film I have ever seen. It took me some time before I worked up the courage to watch the Japanese original of the same name. Plus I've never been a big fan of the foreign film although I have seen a few in the last short while.Ringu is almost the same story as it's American follow up. It follows the story of Investigative Reporter Reiko Asakawa played by the excellent actress Nanako Matsushima who of course I have never seen in anything else but she was excellent in this role. When a close family member and three or four of her friends die mysteriously after watching a video tape made from a strange television transmission the reporter sets out to find the tape. Asakawa watches the tape and then brings in her ex-husband Ryuji Takayama to help her investigate before her time is up. He watches the film and is determined to help her solve the mystery of where the film came from and why it exists. Unfortunately their son Yoichi accidentally watches the film as well making their investigation ever more urgent. They uncover a horrible secret regarding the death of a woman and her strange daughter, and with moments left to live they must solve it.I had some issues with this film that I thought the American version covered much better. For one there was really no reason for Asakawa to watch the tape especially being she had a feeling of truth behind it. Yet she does not hesitate to pop it in and watch in and than gladly shows it to her ex husband. Granted I found the Japanese version slightly harder to follow and maybe that's just a language gap I am not used to crossing. I couldn't understand their actual jobs, I'm guessing they were reporters. I also got lost on several other minor plot things. That's not the fault of the movie maker probably but more likely my understanding. I am a little confused why everyone seems to think this Japanese version is the most terrifying film and how scary it was. It had it's moments, one of the top ones being, as it was in The American version Sadako's appearance into reality, quite terrifying. I found this film to be much more a mystery thriller than a horror or even a fright film. The mystery unravelled brilliantly and it was absolutely captivating especially as the clock ticked down on their time limit. One of the great moments in the film is the scene with the well as they desperately struggle to uncover the last clues with literally minutes left to live. I have not watched the sequels to the Ringu series but I am excited about doing so. The film started out slow but had me riveted by the end of it with incredible acting by the whole cast and a great story. It was also great to watch a movie in a unique original setting which I am not used to seeing in films. The biggest difference between this and the American version is the addition of the ESP. Not only is it shown that Sadako had powerful mind control which was never full explained in The Ring but Asakawa is given the power of visions at one point and her ex-husband also had powerful ESP in which he can see people's past and things that have happened. Although it is not gone into great detail, it's a power that is used to help save them. All in all even if you're not a foreign film fan I highly recommend checking out Ringu especially if you're a fan of the American version. It's a great film and will always entertain. 9/10'\n",

Everything about this film is wonderful: the creepy atmosphere, the tension building, the acting performances, the idea... And the payoff sequence will leave you in total fear of your television.

            "Review: 'After getting lots of flak about the Hollywoodized version of THE RING that audiences saw, Dreamworks makes amends by releasing the original RINGU with subtitles.I didn't even think I had a choice until I went to my local video store and the clerk pointed out that they had *both* versions. Delighted, I immediately picked the original (I haven't seen the American version yet) because... well, hey, I wanted the real thing. I don't like it when Hollywood remakes perfectly good movies \"for me\" to supposedly \"devour\" better: I want to see it in its pure and unbastardized form.I liked watching RINGU and found it quietly unsettling. I have the feeling that this is the sort of movie that is going to eventually work its way under my skin within the next few days because it's taking me a while to sort out emotionally what I experienced after watching it.The only difficulty I had watching it has nothing to do with the movie, which is really well done; it only had something to do with me. I suppose it's because I'm an artist and I've always thought oriental decorations and style beautiful, but I have had the opportunity to watch so few live-action Japanese movies that when I do, I tend to be so enchanted by all the things that are common to oriental culture but otherwise seem pretty and unique to my western eyes... things like paper doors, Japanese writing, lanterns, cushions on the floor and the like... that I keep going \"Wow, that looks so cool\" to the point of getting somewhat distracted from the main story at hand. That was the case here, as I loved the way this movie was filmed and was so busy enjoying all the decorations and such of everyday modern Japanese life that I kept smiling with the feeling of a happily travelling tourist. I had to keep mentally slapping myself to remember that I was watching a spooky story. ;) But that certainly isn't the film's fault.And so it is, and a very uniquely oriental one at that. The way the images and tale are handled, it's not just creepy. It's also sad, angry, hurt and hreatbreaking as well. I found one particular scene involving our heroine (please forgive me, I just can't remember the proper spelling of her name at the moment) deep in a well to be both unsettling and incredibly touching and compassionate at the same time, the sort of thing you just don't normally see coming from Hollywood these days.I wouldn't really call this a \"horror\" movie, I'd use the term \"psychological puzzle thriller\". I'm not sure if I would watch it again since the surprise has been spoiled... but then again, I just might. After all, I got the pants scared off me by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now I love rewatching it because I loved \"playing games\" mentally with its content. So that just might be the case here, too.I don't know if I want to watch the US version, I'm afraid it might spoil it for me. If I do, I'll comment on it. But for now, I just want to bask in this special little accomplishment.'\n",

            "Review: 'When I first became enraptured by The Ring, I wanted to know everything about it.  I wanted to know it's origins, I wanted to know how it came to fruition, I wanted to know everything.  So I began looking for the Japanese version at local Japanese video stores.  None of them had it.  And then I found out that Dreamworks had bought the rights to this version as well and weren't releasing it until they put their version on video and DVD.  So off to the Internet I went where I finally found someone who had all three films on DVD.  So I bought Ringu, Ringu 2 and the prequel on DVD from some guy in Texas for a small sum of about $100.00 U.S.  I didn't care, I had to see the film and find out if all the hype is as justified.Now keep in mind, I not only hold The Ring in such lofty enough company as to say it is one of the best horror films every made, I hold it high enough to say that it is one of the best films ever made.  So for me to like the Japanese version is a feat unto itself.  Having said that, I will say that although Ringu is a good film, it pales in comparison to the better Hollywood effort.  While it is a good film in it's own right, there is no comparing the raw emotion and primal fear that is invoked in you when viewing The Ring.  But this is not a comparison piece, it should be a review unto itself so let's go forward shall we?Ringu shares the same basic premise as The Ring does.  A reporter is investigating a videotape that apparently gives you one week to live after your view it.  After her niece dies ostensibly from viewing the tape, she and her husband investigate it frame by frame and try to dissect the mystery.There is an element of supernatural forces in this film and Sadako, the young girl, is rumoured to have psychic and telekinetic abilities of some sort.  This adds a different dimension to the film and it also makes the viewer a little uneasy, not knowing what could possibly happen next. What bothered me about the film, and perhaps why I didn't enjoy it or like it nearly as much as the American version is there is too much talk and not enough horror.  The story builds, and builds and then there is no real pay off the way there was in the other version.  Sure, Sadako does her thing with the TV and that must have scared the crap out of everyone when they first saw the film but there is just very little to be frightened about beyond that one scene.  Many accuse Hollywood of bastardizing films that they get a hold of but it is not true in this case.  Hollywood has spiced up a rather bland film given it life in every way possible.  While The Ring is one of the scariest films I have ever seen, Ringu is good, but just not great.  While not a nostrum the way many other horror films appear to be, it is also not the great horror film that many pimped it up to be.  If you want to be scared and tense and on edge, watch Verbinski's version.  If you want to see the roots of where the idea came from see this one.  It's not a bad film, it's just not a great one either.7.5 out of 10'\n",

I saw the American remake first, and I have to say they did a good job by that for once. You're more involved in the Gore Verbinski version and there's a lot more feeling with the characters. But I do reckon that this Japanese version deserves all the respect and the praising for its originality ! Especially the last 5 years, there are some clever minds active in Japanese cinema. They breath the fresh air that the genre of horror desperately needed. The story of Ringu is fascinating, frightening and intense... The story about the mysterious videotape and its origin keeps you close to the screen for a good half an hour and you find yourself investigating along with the main characters. A good suspense film should have that effect, so in that point of view, Ringu certainly succeeded. I can't judge Japanese actors very well, but I guess they did a good job...They always look a bit less dedicated than American actors in my eyes but maybe that's just me. The female leads sure looks good enough to me.According to many opinions, Ringu belongs to the greatest horror / thrillers ever made and certainly the best film in this genre in the last ten years. Well, with all do respect, I wouldn't go so far to call it that. Like I said, I praise its originality and ideas but that's it. You should see it, though. And if it's possible, see it before the American remake from 2002.

Tomoko claims that she has seen the video in question, precisely a week ago. Before the night is over Tomoko is dead. Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) is a typical nosey reporter trying to find a good story when she becomes involved in Tomoko's mysterious death. Reiko decides to investigate the story deeper & after some detective work finds the videotape. Reiko makes the mistake of watching the tape, moments after it's over the phone rings. Reiko is cursed & has seven days to try & save herself which becomes even more desperate when her young son Yoichi (Rikiya Otaka) also watches the tape. Together with her ex-husband & Yoichi's Father Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada) she tries to solve the clues & lift the curse that will it seems, inevitability lead to her death!Directed by Hideo Nakata I thought Ringu was an excellent horror film. The script by Hiroshi Takahashi based on the novels by Koji Suzuki is gripping throughout. Not much on screen action takes place, there is no blood or gore, but I was absolutely glued to my seat! The story is both fascinating & absorbing from beginning to end. Director Nakata creates some truly creepy & chilling moments throughout, you would never think something as simple as a phone ringing could be unnerving! The power of the film lies in the story which is revealed as the film progresses, make sure you go into Ringu knowing as little about it as possible. Ringu has a very unfussy, almost documentary look to the photography & production design. Don't expect any flashy camera tricks or expensive overblown sets. This approach, keeping it in the 'real' world, works brilliantly & makes Ringu even more creepy. Everything about this film just works, the only reservation I have is that the final revelation isn't quite as drastic as I'd like & Ringu has no re-watch value whatsoever as once you know how it ends the film will lose two of the things that makes it so great, unpredictability & originality. Oh, and don't be put off by the fact that this is a Japanese film & has subtitles, Ringu is an extremely rewarding film to watch. See it as soon as you can!'\n",

What makes Ringu so intense is the combination of dark images, with one of the creepiest soundtracks in recent memory. Sure everyone can agree that the image of Sadako emerging from the television is scary, but with the inclusion of a sound like nails on a chalkboard to me everything was intensified. This is what the remake failed to understand for the most part( although this version does overdo it a bit with the creepy music, scary image shock. Sadako emerging from TV good, Reiko's picture distortion a little too much) opting for beautiful haunting images, and a good score from Hans Zimmer. Another plus is the thought of what is seen offscreen. For example when Reiko sees the Man with the Shrouded head reflected at the end of the film, or the image of Sadako in the television after the tape is first viewed, these are moments that work better than just a blur on a screen that the remake presents to the viewer. Another thing that amazes me about Ringu is that the story never loses control of itself like the remake does. Scenes like Ryuji's psychic visions, or the contents of the tape itself seem perfectly logical to the narrative. This can't really be said of the overly long video tape, the weird horse death scene, or Brian Cox's suicide in the remake. Oh and by the way the kid is less annoying in this film. The filmmakers here didn't saddle an eight year old with deep philosophical quotes that sound as corny as Maize. That just brings back to many painful Episode One memories (Are you an angel?) All is not well though. Even though it was perfectly logical the Ryuji tough guy act and Reiko scaredy cat act got on my nerves. Sure it fits with the characters and their professions, but I like the remakes use of the two characters better. Also better was the setup for the ending, which just sort of happens in this one. In the remake I liked the false pretense (Even though I already new what was to come) that Noah and Rachel were going to get back together and be a happy family with Aiden. And that moment (where it should have ended) where Rachel turns the chair around, priceless. Also disturbing was the fact that Reiko chooses to show the tape to her father to save Yoichi. Knowing who she going to show the tape to sounds mean since its her own father, even if it does set up the sequel in Ringu 2. Still a great flick, worth watching if you don't get annoyed when people in different countries actually speak in their native languages. I've heard too many complaints from people who didn't want to see it because its a foreign film.'\n",

'Ringu' is an interesting, original and entertaining enough supernatural thriller, but 'Ring' far exceeds it in terms of atmosphere, acting, general production values and overall eeriness. Whereas the plot is more openly explained in 'Ringu', I actually found, in hindsight, that the puzzling aspects of 'Ring' add to the movie.'Ringu' is different enough in plot, particularly in the second half, to  be worth a look. It's certainly an above average movie, but this is one  time that Hollywood took a foreign movie and improved on it. I would give 'Ringu' about 6.5, and 'Ring' at least 8.0.Oh, by coincidence, the night before watching 'Ringu', I watched 'The Changeling' - the US horror movie from 1980. Now watch that, and tell me 'Ringu' didn't borrow a rather central idea from that. Well, well...'\n",

Terrifying? Say what?! Has anybody out there seen any horror movies made prior to 'Scream'?? Give me a break! If you think this is the most frightening movie you've ever seen then you must have a really scary time getting up in the middle of the night for a glass of milk! Whooooo! Better watch out!The initial premise regarding a strange TV broadcast that kills those who see it bears some similarity to Cronenberg's 'Videodrome', a much more original, intelligent and genuinely disturbing movie. After that 'Ringu' goes in a completely different (supernatural) direction. And it goes in that direction at a snail's pace! Dull, dull, dull! I fail to see anything spooky about this boring and incoherent crap. Tension? Really? And the \"explanation\" for the events is downright silly and makes NO SENSE!'The Blair Witch Project', though a box office hit, was scoffed at by many discerning horror buffs as over-hyped and not very effective. I myself thought it was uneven with only a few good moments and a lame climax, but compared to 'Ringu' it is a MASTERPIECE of terror. This movie sucks in any language!'\n",

We first see Riyuji's reaction. This A-male-with-all-the-answers first looks puzzled, then disturbed. He hands over the picture to Asakawa, we see her reaction: Distressed! Then....WHAM!

Since the american relase was titled THE ring, and not ringu, I feel like I have to shed some light on this situation...In japanese, when you use a form of writing called katakana, it means the word you are using is either a foreign word or an onomatopeia, and in this case, RINGU refers to the RINGING OF THE DAMN PHONE! not *A* ring, like they did in the american version.I hope this will never be an issue again.Another thing, I loved this original and spooky japanese movie, much more than the american remake. The pace is taut, the feel is much more consistent and elegant, it has a fantastic use of silences, the photography is stunning, and the acting is first rate -if you dont feel yourself sympathysing with the characters it must be because of the cultural differences, but the lead character seemed sweet and geniuinely concerned for her sons well being, instead in the american version Naomi Watts looks blank and totally self centered.I thought the story was gripping from the very start, leaving just enough room to doubt whether the murders might be the work of a lunatic. It just has a great urban legend feeling to it. Then slowly they start hinting towards something more freakish and supernatural, and it always keeps you guessing. Every time the characters discover another lead, it still leaves something unanswered. And the japanese think their audiences are just smart enough that you dont have to spell everything out with ABC blocks like the americans do. Some things you just KNOW without needing to be told, like the video is actually a psychic projectation of Sadakos rage, hinting towards all her reasons for it. Sadako is an unnatural entity, one that needs no reason for being evil.Oh and one more thing... Sadako would scare Samara to death.'\n",

This story sets up the viewer right at the start with a young girl telling her friend how she and some others viewed a strange video tape and heard a story that after its watched the phone rings and tells you that you have one week to live. The young girl and her friends die under weird circumstances and her aunt Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) decides to investigate. She goes to the same cabin and finds a video and watches it. Its the same tape and she gets the call (The Ring!) so now she has one week to live. She gets her ex-husband Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) to view a copy she made and he decides to help. He's a professor at a university but he also has ESP. One night Reiko wakes up and finds her son watching the tape so now the three of them are playing beat the clock. They trace the tape back to an area that had volcano trouble and years earlier a woman had been known to make strange predictions. *****SPOILER ALERT***** The film continues with them finding out that the strange woman had died years earlier but that her daughter was the one that had the real powers. She had very strong powers and it was learned that the girls father murdered her and dumped her into a well at the location where the cabin is. They go there to try and find the body and hope the evil curse of the tape will be over. This is a well made thriller that was based on a Japanese novel and the script seems to be well adapted. Your never really lost while viewing this film although your never sure whats going to happen next. Its never confusing but it does a good job of keeping you guessing. The film is shown in increments of days but if you think its because its counting down until Reiko's time is up, your wrong. The film ends with Reiko figuring out that if you make a copy of the tape after you view it you will be saved. So the film is actually showing you the date in a never ending cycle. Film sets a good pace and never goes over the top as far as the material is concerned. Film ends with a question that is simple enough to answer but it makes you realize that its a cycle that can't be broken. Good creepy thriller that never bores its viewer because of the pace it sets. Even if you don't like foreign films you might want to check this one out. Now that I have seen this, I can see the American version!'\n",

Anyway I heard an American version was coming and I know I had to see the Original for the American one...So now I've seen 'Ringu', however...I think time I spent reading all the reviews about it kind of spoiled it for me...I knew what to expect...or expected something similar to what actually happened. It was a very good movie even though it didn't creep me out like I wanted it to. It kept me entertained with the unraveling supernatural-mystery type story. This movie gets compared to THE OTHERS, and I have to say, The Others did creep me out in the end...it had totally flipped me out. While I was watching the others I thought I wasn't going to be too pleased with the ending, about the time the kids snuck into the graveyard and figures *something* out about their housekeepers -- I thought that was going to be the big twist...and I was like 'well that wasn't too special' ...but after that they caught me off guard and totally blew me away...NOW, in 'RINGU' I kept waiting for the big thing to trip me out in the end...but it turned out the scene in the end that I thought was going to lead to something greater...was the creepy scene that everyone was talking about...so it kind of let me down in that way.

So I'll say this; \"The Ring\" is a poor schlocky Americanised film which takes a good idea and stamps it into a mediocre mold. \"Ring\" or \"Ringu\" is a very good film. If you're trying to decide which one to see, use that as your guide. In fact, an interesting point about the films can be summed up looking at the titles. \"The Ring\" has an added 'definite article' indicator; \"The\". This implies that the film is about a ring. It isn't. Enough said. There's a lot more ambiguity in the one-word translation of the Japanese film's title; \"Ring\". It's ambiguous, maybe even... thought provoking! I think that sums up the differences.So, yes, Ring is a good, tense, movie. It runs almost like a detective story rather than a traditional horror film as the main character works her way closer to finding the facts behind the mysterious video tape. But all the while there's an ever-mounting tension as her numbered days expire. In this way it's reminiscent of Angel Heart, another dark, tense, supernatural detective story which demonstrates that the big American studios will sometimes make a good dark thriller. In fact, the tension, partly thanks to the minimal music and synthesizer noises as well as the excellent subdued lighting and camerawork, is the making of a film in which very little actually happens. Ring is a lesson in how to make an everyday cityscape seem scary and bleak while the addition of supernatural overtones, which I'm told weren't in the original books to the same extent, are a welcome addition and source of mystery. I suspect, although I cannot read Japanese, that the film is probably an improvement on the books. Perhaps the main skill in creating a popular horror movie is to create a viable adversary. Sadako is perhaps the best example of this in film making. She is just a damp, bedraggled figure in an off-white night-dress whose hair obscures her features and who, as far as I can remember, isn't even seen until the last few minutes. Yet she invokes a real sense of menace, you know she is powerful and malevolent through the characters' reactions to her, even if she doesn't graphically do anything horrifying. Say \"Sadako\" to anyone who's seen the film and watch their face tense up for an instant.\n",

The american \"The Ring\" is not as purely horrifying as Ringu and Ringu 2, as the pace in the japanese versions are methodical and steady as it gets scarier and scarier. You have to really see both Ringu and Ringu 2 BACK TO BACK to get the full effect. Ringu is essentially an exercise in fantasy-horror, an indulgent push into the strange human interest in the macabre. It is obsessed with two notions: suffering and rage, but highly muted. It is the on-screen equivalent of someone shouting at the top of their lungs in horror as the mute button is pushed. It's just very disturbing to sit through this thing, and I don't think many horror films can even come close to this one. There are several recurring elements that are of interest, most notably how news reporters are centrally involved with the downfall of the odd and strange, or interfere with others without concern, and the use of television to \"babysit\" our kids these days. These two elements reinforce the reality of the movie as they correspond with our own ideas of \"meddling journalists\" and \"the danger of TV for our youth\", adding a dimension that gives the movie more weight and pull for the viewer.

In her last week alive she tries to get to the truth behind the video (and it's apparent power) in order to save her life, and also the lives of her son and ex-husband who end up watching the tape.Chances are you've heard of this film, or at least its American remake. Ringu is the most successful film in Japanese history in terms of financial box office records, and is seen as marmite for horror fans (love it or hate it?).The first time I saw this film I almost wet myself. Seriously. Every twist, dark camera angle, screeching of the non-melodic soundtrack had my heart racing. Unfortatnutley, it wasn't true of the second viewing. The scares are obvious a mile off (due to long build ups), and in terms of horror it doesn't quite work.However, I would still say that as a film it still works. Unlike most of its fellow genre inmates, even with the horror stripped away, there is enough narrative to make the film work and the detective side of the story (although fairly underwhelming at times due to the easy accessibility of what they are looking for) makes it far more worthwhile than the typical slasher flicks that have plagued the horror films recently.The dark undertones (murky lighting, and slow panning shots) certainly create an atmosphere suitable on first viewing, but on second time round, without the shock value, they are a little bit too obvious, as if the plot is stuck in a linear rut in terms of style.The film is superior to its American cousin in my view due to the strong cast, and the horrifying first viewing (if you haven't seen this film I would advice you watch it with someone, with the lights on), and whilst directed very tastefully and artistically (and far better than any American horror of the last 10 or so years) lacks the brutal or horrific punch an effective horror film should have.'\n",

When her niece turns into the tape's latest victim a journalist makes it her mission to find a way to lift the curse.Now for comparing Ringu to The Ring.The Ring was an overall good movie, but it didn't really leave me with a sense of paranoia like Ringu did. There are many differences between Ringu and The Ring. A lot of scenes that where in the American version, such as the part where the father electrocutes himself in the bathtub or the scene with the horse, that weren't in this version.Highlight: The climax when we get to see the girl's eye.8/10'\n",

I can only assume American remade this version (though I haven't seen it yet) to make it better because and I know I'm the minority looking at the audience reviews on this website but I thought this was awful. It was all in Japanese though that didn't bother me as I thought the acting was pretty good, the idea of the story with the videotape where if you watch it you receive a phone call saying you will die in a week unless you pass a copy onto someone else is interesting and the music was creepy. The atmosphere I could tell the director was trying to create suspense and scare but it just didn't. It was more like a murder mystery than a horror but even then it wasn't interesting and why wouldn't the characters just destroy the damn videotape? They don't even discuss it which makes this film and them dumb. Nothing really remotely creepy or scary happens and as a result I just got bored out of my mind. This is one \"horror\" film I won't be losing any sleep over. I found Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire more scary than this rubbish.'\n",

            "Review: 'Over the past few months, it has been a popular topic to discuss. What is the greatest horror movie of all? Some would argue it's THE EXORCIST and its head spinning demon-girl. Others would argue it's THE SHINING, for its axing actions or PSYCHO and it's famous shower moment. Still, gore and sickness isn't as popular with some, so they got for the psychological horrors. Hence some would say either THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or THE WICKER MAN. Of course in every 90's horror flick, we have our protagonist and going against the rules again. It isn't a stupid teenager who runs about in the dark with a butcher knife to attack the killer with. She's early-twenties, single mother; T.V reporter whom is researching the evil cursed videotape.Reiko Asakawa (played outstandingly by Nanako Matsushima) TV reporter is researching an urban legend about a cursed video when her niece dies. At first, this just seems to be a sad tragic event that Reiko and her seven year old son Yoichi (A small but remarkable job from Rikiya Otaka) but, she soon finds out that three of the niece's friends died the same way, same day and same time. Reiko shots off down to the roots of all the rumors Izu Pacific Land. However, on her arrival, she finds nothing but friendly people, a nice and conformable rental cottage and beautiful weather Reiko is relaxed and yet, disappointed that she can't find anything. However she soon comes across the un-filed videotape. Allowing her curiosity to get the best of her, she watches the tape. After it ends she gets the 'ring' Leaving her with one to live Now in every movie, horror or not, the damsel in distress has her 'Prince Charming' to come and rescue her. This is no acceptation when Reiko calls on her estranged ex-husband, Ryuji Takayama (Played by the wonderful Hiroyuki Sanada) to help with the situation. Whatever the reason they divorced, it certainly wasn't lack of love, as Ryuji watches the video and is cursed also. Now Reiko and Ryuji have just six days till their deadline. Together they manage to pick out clues from the videotape, including a mysterious young woman looking in a mirror and the character 'Sada'. When they find out about the eruption on the videotape, Ryuji tries to take charge of the game and sends Reiko to her father's home. However, it's not to be a smooth ride or as simple as that as one fateful night, little Yoichi watches the tape. Fighting for the life of their son as well as their own, Ryuji and Reiko must face off the darkness they are plunged into about the maker of the cursed videotape. How Reiko will make her deadline with only two days left? Will they be able to save Yoichi and themselves from the fear of Sadako? RING is staring some of the best names in Japan, before some of them were famous. Each character was detailed and played by the perfect choices. Reiko Asakawa is portrayed perfectly by the beautiful and talented Nanako Matsushima. Ring's leading lady was a perfect choice for the role, and fitted the role like a glove. Her acting was just a shining example on what a gifted actress she really is. When watching the movie you'll be lost in how believable she is. She plays the respectable, kind, loving and brave Reiko who will do anything to try and protect her loved ones, especially her little son Yoichi. She is a woman who is sweeter then sugar and she proves that even the nicest of us can end up in terrible danger. The gripping chemistry that ran between the main stars was very powerful. Each one behaves as if they have known one another for years and there is an aura there. Ryuji Takayama was played by the wonderful and handsome Hiroyuki Sanada really opened the screen wider. His acting was spot-on and made the role. He is Ryuji Takayama. Ryuji is a very pained and depressed man but he's very loving and lovable. You feel such glowing warmth from him. Despite the fact that Ryuji and Reiko are divorced, there's still a strong bond there. Though they aren't all over each other, they are clearly very special to one another. When with Ryuji, Reiko seems to feel more safe and relaxed. When she thought she was going to die, she pleaded with him to stay with her when she died. He seems to try his hardest for her. As soon as she presented the problem, he came straight to her side to try and help. Not only does he seem to still seem deeply in love with her; he always asks after their son.With a brilliant cast of characters that you really learn to love and a plot line that takes you by the hand and throws you're imagination off all the walls. This is one horror movie that shouldn't only be rented; it should grace the shelves of any other horror movie fan, next to all the other classics. This is a classic horror movie and it will be remembered when everyone else has forgotten the Hollywood remake. This movie will be open to many more remakes over the next twenty years or so and millions of Japanese horror movies will be made around this movie as well as Hollywood remakes. This is the movie that you have to watch first! Forget about the remakes like THE RING and RING VIRUS. Forget the sequels, the rip offs, the spin offs You will always remember 'Ring' because it is top of the pyramid of horror!'\n",

The average made for TV thriller that runs on the Lifetime channel is more suspenseful than this. I LOVE horror films & I scare easily, but there is just nothing to this. I thought perhaps I saw an edited DVD version but friends who are fans swear that what I saw is the directors cut. Sorry but there's just nothing even remotely scary, suspenseful, creepy or atmospheric about this film. The cinematography & editing are amateur & the music & sound effects are straight out of a Charles Band/Full Moon cheapie circa 1989. Mabey the American remake is better but I doubt it since the basic story is not only dopey but has been done before with better results (\"Videodrome\" & \"Shock\"). Don't believe the hype like I did & spend a lot of time hunting this down. If you think that \"Poltergeist\" is the scariest horror film ever then perhaps this is for you. If you have actually seen a good horror film before--like \"Carnival of Souls\", \"Texas Chaninsaw Massacre\", \"Frailty\", \"Silence of the Lambs\", Halloween\",\"Exorcist\", \"Re-animator\", the \"Evil Dead\" series or \"Dagon\"--then don't waste your time or money on this lightweight.'\n",

            "Review: 'I have to add a dissenting voice here, and state that 'Ring' is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the poorest excuses for a horror film I've ever had the displeasure of seeing.Slow, meandering, lacking wholly in suspense of terror, this amateurish effort smacks of being rushed to completion before anyone had a chance to take a long hard look at the structure and say \"er, no\".That it has been lauded so highly by critics and non-genre audiences alerts us to two things. That critics are desperate to get their names on posters for the next underground hit and that audiences should see more horror films. The idea is nice, though the urban myth angle strains against the blatant techno-supernatural guff of a \"cursed video tape\". However, the hour and a half of plodding investigation into Sadako's origins just irritates, largely due to an unlikeable cast and hopeless dialogue. The fact that it's so badly lit (having no lights is not \"artistic\" or \"moody\", it's just unwatchable) and poorly filmed (editing? pacing? hello?) doesn't help either. Better suited to a format like a mid-season X-Files episode, here the format is stretched to breaking over the running time. When the two protagonists find the well and try to empty it with small buckets, all sympathy drains and you just want them dead as soon as possible for their contrived stupidity.\n",
            "The fact that the film has a much talked-about \"big scare\" is nothing but another \"urban myth\". Poorly staged, the sequence involving Sadako's crawling from the TV set is hokey, laughable and a great big fat let-down. The film also betrays it's desperation when the 'ghost' of one of the main characters reappears, with a bag on his head no less, to *point* to the final plot twist. \"Just get it the hell over with\" he seems to be saying. The audience I saw this with agreed with him.Can Japanese cinema do anything except recreate moments from Western successes? Not going by what's on offer here. See 'Videodrome', 'Candyman' and, since it's been mentioned heavily in the advertising, 'Blair Witch'- all of which deliver. 'Ring' doesn't. Doesn't even come close. To hell with it, and 'Ring 2'.'\n",

I love the differences in Sadako and Samara because they deliver their scare in different ways.Sadako moves in an awkward fashion but for the most part she looks like any other girl. Her skin, hair and clothes are dry. She is scary because you just don't know what is under all that hair and when she flashes her eye, you can see she is anything but normal. I like that they only showed her eye because she is still a mystery.Samara, in my opinion, has a better look. She freaked me out more when she climbed out of the TV. She is disgustingly wet and she has a supernatural look due to the grainy way she is portrayed outside of the television. We get to see her face but all of her mystery is gone at that point. While it is impactful, it sorta takes away some of the shock factor she could have in future films.I love both films and appreciate that they each have their own style.

In its conclusion, 'Ring' then adds an interesting twist: you can save yourself by copying the tape. But the film doesn't actually dwell on the mechanisms of this viral curse. Nor does it really convince in exploring the psychology of belief or the imminence of death - cursed individuals supposedly have one week before they die, yet the heroes behave quite calmly for most of this interval (as if they did not believe it), only to periodically shout \"We have only three days left!\" in a panic stricken voice. Indeed, the film works more as a thriller than a horror movie, as the heroes try to track down the cause of the curse in the manner of a detective story. In the manner of the best thrillers, the enemy is always out of sight, a power undefined, and this is a smart choice, as it means that the film does not have to make specific the metaphysics of its alternative world. But it's a bit hard to construct a detective story where the breakthroughs seem to come from ESP flashes, rather than from the investigations carried out. If you were to try and summarise the plot of this film, \"because\" and \"therefore\" would not be words you could use very often: the film is more a collection of images than a wholly coherent story.The portrait of modern Japan (and its rather British climate) is something I like, but I'm not sure that the acting is actually that good (or that Japanese women are really that submissive in manner - one can sense that this film is directed by a man). There are a few genuinely chilling moments, but the film works hard to provide them; the low key, naturalistic style disguises a creaking plot. Overall, I find it hard to understand why this film was such a hit; its sequel, 'Ring 2', went further into the metaphysics of the curse and made even less sense. A peculiar film; and sadly in this case, that does not mean good.'\n",

Maybe the only problem with this film is that it is subtitled I myself have no problem with this but I know some people will not watch or have trouble following a subtitled film which is a shame as those people will most likely turn to the American remake of this The Ring. Although the American version isn't at all bad it just doesn't have the same atmosphere as this film does. This film does tend to have a rather slow pacing but this all adds to the climax at the end, when I first watched this I had no idea of any of the plot details and really enjoyed the ending which was the best ending I've ever seen in a film of this type and I never guessed it unlike some films eg.

            "Review: '\"Ringu\" is a good and original movie. The story is really good and creepy. The storytelling of the movie is even better, which makes this movie not just a good horror movie but also a good character movie.The movie doesn't really has 'scare' moments and perhaps because of this it has some missed opportunities in it but instead the movie has a creepy feeling and atmosphere throughout the movie, which compensates for this. Also the mysterious story adds to the tension and atmosphere of the movie.The acting isn't exactly mind blowing but it never really becomes disturbingly bad.It's too bad that the movie has some cheap looking effects, with a bigger budget this movie could had really become an even better one.And then the eternal question which movie is the better one; \"Ringu\" or \"The Ring\". The answer is quite easy, whatever movie you've seen first will be your favorite. Both movies have their own charm and different good things and less successful elements. From a movie technical point of view \"The Ring\" is however a better movie. It has an overall better look and has way better special effects and make-up.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/'\n",

The film itself was okay but nothing earth-shattering which makes me wonder why or who created such a massive buzz around it. The concept is cool (reminded me of VIDEODROME) but it is unnecessarily padded and the film was at times dull or flat. The main problem with the story though is that once someone views the tape, they have 7 days before they die. So, the film starts with someone viewing the tape and the bulk of the movie is about the people trying to figure out how to stop this curse from killing the people who viewed the tape. In other words, nothing much happens between the beginning and the end.\n",

Make no mistake that this is the one that started it all...one beast of a horror movie oozing not only bucket loads of originality, but some of best acting capabilities that Japan has to offer.The story revolves around Reiko Asakawa, a news reporter who has recently found out about a group of people (one of whom is her niece) who have died in unexplained circumstances. She decides to investigate and discovers a mysterious video-tape that is rumoured to kill a person after one week of viewing. Dipping as far into the rumour as she possibly can - with the help of her ex-husband - she finally views the tape for herself. But when the phone rings after viewing, she begins to suspect that the mystery of the video-tape could very well be fact after all. And seeing as she now only has one week left to live...she sets out on a path to discovery to find and eradicate the curse's source.Throughout the entire film there is enough eeriness and gritty atmosphere to keep you grabbing for your dear life on the edge of your seat. You are waiting for the ending...and due to the mounting terror of each scene, you know it will hurt when it comes.And oh does it! I can't go into too much detail, because of just how affective the ending sequence is. I really don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it...The stunning direction of Nakata (Dark Water) shows throughout. Building up the tension between each character that meets their ultimate doom, Nakata truly brings forward the fact that he IS the God of J-Horror as we know it.This film will definitely make you uneasy...there's no doubt about that. However, i will admit that not EVERYONE will actually be scared by it. After all different films affect different people. But no matter whether this film scares you or not...you'll damn well be thinking about it for around another 6 months. And be damn sure not to watch any other Asian horrors within the same week, due to the J-Horror's obsession with female characters with long black hair (THIS is the film that started all that), you can be sure that you'll see a lot of reference to this film in ANY other Asian horror film you're likely to come across. Even the likes of Shimizu Takashi's Ju-On series have reference to this beast.There really is no doubt in the world that this is the true landmark film of the Asian horror genre. Final Verdict: Ringu is the one that started it all: the long black hair...gritty imagery/audio...signature pop-shots...the lot!

And it doesn't attempt to horrify you with bloody stumps or entrails. Ring is good horror because it strikes at the very heart of our sense of safety in the modern world.Asakawa is a divorced journalist with a young son. She begins to investigate a series of strange deaths, deaths that have been linked to the viewing of a videotape. The rumour at a local school is that whoever watches the tape will die within one week.Restful moments, carefully considered colours and shot composition and excellent sound and music design all add to the suspense and sense of impending doom. The few minutes of the haunted video that we see are genuinely disturbing without being over-the-top or cliched.(I am dismayed that Hollywood has decided to re-make this film using American actors. I am also appalled at another reviewer describing the original's Japanese heritage as a \"hitch\". When will Americans learn to appreciate other cultures' films as they are?)Ring is an excellent film AND an excellent horror film. For best effect, watch it in a darkened room late at night, or a darkened theatre as it is still playing in many independent cinemas. But you might want to watch it with someone else.'\n",

I mean, honestly, horror films don't exactly scare me to death like it does for some hyper-sensitive people who watch films.  Now that's not a slight on the genre, however. I love horror cinema. I feel critics need to be more open and appreciative for the creative aspects of many horror films out there.  They see a couple awful horror films (mainly in the U.S., unfortunately)and shut themselves out for others out there that deserve to be seen and given respect. They're really missing out, especially when it comes to Japanese Horror. And Ringu IS the primary example of how wonderfully dazzling the horror genre can be. Warning!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The idea of the vengeful spirit (Sadako) putting out a curse on society for living the life she couldn't live was brilliantly conceived by director Nakata with a hypnotic use of sound and creepy atmosphere in the air.  Some complain that since it is not as scary as the hype made it out, it is not a good film. That's just not fair judgment. It was well shot, well composed, well acted, well made, and had a genuinely intriguing premise. It has high aspirations as a work of class art.  It wasn't as fast paced as other films within the genre, but I welcomed that. It was slowly building up to a truly shocking climax. Some guy mentioned here that he saw the ending a mile away, yeah sure. Ok, maybe he did guess that Reiko was saved from the curse because she made a copy of the video and had her ex watch it...but there's no way he expected her to end up planning to have her DAD watch the tape to save Yoichi. I don't care what anyone says, that was unexpected. But it was a fitting end. It just takes the idea of the chain-letter to the extreme. END OF SPOILERS!!! In conclusion, not all horror films are junk meant to give some cheap thrills. Many are actually quality pieces of filmmaking that can provide the audience with an ample dose of entertainment, thrills, and intriguing tales. Ringu is a must see for anybody remotely interested in horror films and just films, for that matter. It is a classic so get the Region 1 DVD for those who can make use of it(Besides, it's better than the U.S. remake for those wondering, although that one was solid in its own right.) It is worth noting that I feel Ringu 2 was a disappointment, although competently made.  But Ringu 0: Birthday, is a GREAT prequel and another GREAT movie from Japan, while not really a horror movie.'\n",

            "Review: 'Compared to the American remake, the approach of this original Japanese version of \"The Ring\" is more subtle and understated, creating a general tone of horror and foreboding that might be likened to a harrowing slow burn. I was struck by a kind of documentary quality to the film which in turn further enhances the horror through imparting it a naked and yet uncompromising feeling of realism. It is, however, considerably weaker than its American counterpart in terms of character development; an issue that may prove particularly burdensome to American viewers who may already be feeling alienated by the sometimes notable cultural divide. Such concerns notwithstanding, Ringu treats us to one of the most terrifying sequences offered on film, emblazoning its truly grotesque image on the viewers mind in preparation for haunting their dreams to come. Watch for this sequence, if for no other reasons.With its restrained use of horror that implies violence rather than explicily showing it, emphasizing suspense and the creeping nature of its threat rather than relying on overt violence, the film's design was a slap in the face to a horror industry that had relied on slasher one-upsmanship to put asses in seats for decades. Along with the underground hit of the Blair Witch Project, the cult classic status of this film inspired emulations in Japan, the United States, and beyond. The premise is straightforward and the simple, unrelenting nature of the threat keeps the film compelling. That said, there are some weaknesses - the narrative's reliance on unexplained psychic abilities (independent of the supernatural monster) are jarring, the twisted death faces are pretty silly, and one of the most entertaining moments of the film is the vision of Sadako's death, which is depicted in an almost Charlie Chaplin-esque visual style that includes a hilariously out-of-place and cartoonish 'BONK'! Several thematic interpretations have been applied to the film, which ultimately feel unnecessary; why can't reasonably well-designed horror just be that?'\n",

I do like chilling movies that rely on building tension rather than blood and guts, but this failed to build sufficient tension for me to be scared.

In retrospect, had I known what Ringu would entail I would have avoided it like the plague. Not because Ringu is a bad film, by any means, but because it is singularly the most terrifying film I have ever seen.Ringu is a slow burner, with the action not starting until about 3/4 of the way into the film. The beginning follows Reiko Asakawa's investigation of a mystery tape that kills anyone who watches it, 7 days after their time of viewing.The investigation takes Reiko and her (somewhat gormless) ex husband Ryuji to a desolate island in Japan where they learn the story of Shizuko and Sadako Yamamura, the latter being the creator of the 'Ring' tape.Sadako's character is an interesting one, as her notions within the film are somewhat ambiguous. Whether Sadako is a lonely, repressed little girl or outright evil force is left unclear, though based on Rie Inou's superb eerie bodily contortions and ghastly presence in *that* scene, I'd opt for the latter every time. There is something unshakably evil about Sadako's character- I put a large part of it down to the inhumanity of her. Her strange bent posture, the freaky eye and the lack of articulation. Keeping Sadako silent was a fantastic directorial decision by Hideo Nakata; the shroud of mystery surrounding Sadako mean she is even more scary. For the short amount of time she is in the film, Sadako's character makes a huge impact. The simplicity of her move of choice is made terrifying by the familiarity it is contained within. We all have televisions, phones, and VCRs in our home but never expect these to be a source of terror. About 4 months on I still fear the television opposite my bed, and have slept badly as a result of this for months. I don't exaggerate here. If you scare easily, don't watch Ringu; it is unspeakably eerie. I've read a few reviews calling the filming and shots amateur but I personally think the hindered view is frightening- you never see what is near, working alongside the main premise of the film- the unseen is scary. I think it is beautifully shot, well acted and superbly climatic. A film as subtly conceived as it is hauntingly realised.'\n",

Normally I prefer the original one when a Hollywood remake is made (like \"Abre los ojos\" vs \"Vanilla sky\"), but this time I found them about equally good. The cursed video in The Ring was made better and the fly coming out of it was a great addition to the story. Also for once the American version didn't over explain, but explained less. In Ringu however, there's more symbolism and a better way of tension building. Even though the video in the ring was scarier, Ringu was more frightening. The atmosphere of the movie was just better than in The Ring. And the curse was better. In The Ring copying was enough, here you have to show it to someone else, you have to curse someone yourself. And even though Ringu explains more, it leaves more questions(psychological, not questions about the plot). It gives you a strange feeling, it stays with you longer than The Ring.So in conclusion they both have their ups and downs, I gave them both an 8/10.

How does one describe the visions on the VHS tape that we see? Maybe like a half-eaten dream from David Lynch or that Begotten film, but filtered back into Japan and transformed into the stuff that you really should leave in the bottom of a well.I think if you can get on the wavelength of the pacing which may feel slow for some but for me clicked in as Takana let's moments and scenes breathe a little, like Sanada and the old father on the beach, or those beats during the long well set piece.I do think Matsushima is better as someone who reacts than a fully emptional presence in the film (something the American remake definitely did better via Watts casting), but Sanada is a formidable presence and that makes up for a lot. I dug this quite a bit, even as some of it is hard to compare to the remake (ie the kid is a little too flat in this one for me, maybe that is the idea).

            "Review: 'A superb horror thriller from Japan, Ring somehow manages to be remarkably unusual and innovative while at the same time stealing elements from innumerable Western precursors. Visually, there are nods to Poltergeist, Suspiria and Carrie while the plot borrows generously from Candyman.But Ring is the exact opposite of Hollywood's recent trend towards knowingly ironic, camp comedy-horror movies. This is a downbeat, serious movie full of a typically Japanese sense of fear and ambiguity, an interface between the modern, technological era and an earlier age of superstition, curses and vengeful ancestors. If Ring occasionally provokes sniggers rather than chills  it's hard to know what to make of a film which pivots on the phrase Frolic in brine, goblins be thine,' for example -  that's mainly because the film was made primarily with domestic Japanese audiences in mind. But even this foreign-ness' ends up as a plus, building up a genuinely unnerving sense of unpredictable dislocation.Seeing Ring on the big screen not recommended, it is probably better on the small screen. This is because the plot pivots on the malign influence of a curse video,' its power the focus of a fictional, but entirely believable urban myth: after watching the video, the story goes, your telephone rings and a voice informs you that you have exactly one week left to live.The story attracts the attention of divorced journalist Reiko (Matsushima) after four teenagers, including her cousin, simultaneously drop dead. She tracks down the tape, and watches its brief succession of bizarre, haunting images. Then the phone rings, and the film becomes a race against time as Reiko tries to exorcise' the curse, which soon extends to her surly ex-husband Ryuji (Sanada) and their young son, Yoichi (Nakatani) as they also view the tape. Ring shows an unusual attention to detail at every level, from Hayashi's multi-layered, evocatively cryptic script to Nakata's no-nonsense direction. The film has a deceptively flat, everyday look that contrasts all the more strikingly with the arty experimentalism of the curse video,' and the starkness of periodic black-and-white flashbacks - the rational world thus disrupted and subverted by impossible' manifestations of evil. Kenji Kawai's diverse score adds enormously to the growing impact of the story, as does the technique of announcing each new day with an on-screen title  it's been done before in movies of all kinds, most notably The Shining  but never with such skilful creepiness. Though it works brilliantly as an intelligent thriller  and the final two scenes wrap things up with a pair of especially satisfying twists  Ring isn't just' a frightening horror picture. It subtly dramatises the tensions in a Japanese culture that, no matter how urgently it strides into a westernised, baseball-playing, high-tech future, can't quite shake off the insistent ghosts of its mystical past, just as Reiko is forced to abandon her air-conditioned, neon-lit Tokyo office and head to the countryside, then to a wild, wind-swept island, then into the very darkness of the earth itself, to confront the demons that threaten her very existence. And if many questions, many tensions, remain unresolved  a sequel and a prequel have already been released in Japan  that doesn't mean Ring is either inconclusive or a lazy cop-out. Like all the great horror directors, Nakata is primarily a collaborator. He starts the circle  we finish it.The American remake The Ring, starring Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase was released in 2002.Verdict: Easily better than most modern horrors, Ring is a spectacular chiller which is thought provoking, and nightmarishly original. *****'\n",

The set/lights are quite astonishing, the soundtrack is also very good, with a lot of \"scratchy sounds\" that make you jump from your seat. In my opinion, there are some few scenes that are close to the perfection (the sequence of the cursed video on which the story is based has to be seen, it makes you feel sooo uncomfortable). To sum it up, although the plot would have deserved more development, it's a good Japanese movie, if you have the chance to find it somewhere, don't hesitate, it gives another vision of \"horror\". By the way, I've only seen Japanese versions on sale, I don't know if there is an English dubbed/subtitled version.'\n",

            "Review: 'There are some things in this review which may be seen as spoilers I don't scare too easily while watching horror movies. Most of them are either ridiculously boring and have dodgy music, but every so often, a film like Ringu comes along. And then, my impressions of the horror genre is changed. Ringu is the most scary film i have ever seen. In terms of making you Sh*t scared, this film is incredible. If you like art films, the music and ambience of this film is amazing. The camera work is superb, and i thought that the way that they used flashback and change of medium was very effective.This film is memorable not just for these things, but for the television scene. A woman pulls herself out of a sealed well in a video, and walks slowly towards the camera. She is almost shambling, and her neck is bent with her hair falling over her head, so you cannot see her face. She is wearing a white dress. Slowly she comes closer to the camera, while one of the lead characters stares, horrified. Eventually, her head is pressed against the TV screen. suddenly, the screen ripples, and she slowly comes out of the TV, dragging herself through. The man tries to run, but she inexorably comes closer and closer to him. then, she looks up. All you can see of her face is one shrunken eyelid, with a shriveled eye inside.then, it cuts to someone else. The music, and the almost balletic way that the scene is choreographed, makes it the most scary sequence in cinema history.'\n",

When I first saw \"The Ring\" I failed to grasp what kind of story this was--it hit me as I watched \"Ringu:\" this is a classic Japanese ghost story, from a culture as fascinated by ghosts as the English are. This is the spirit, if you will, in the videocassette. It is a presence so powerful it can physically kill its victim.The American film is far more atmospheric--it is a horror film that pulls out all the stops. Can anyone forget the frenzied horses on the ferry boat? Or the demented drawing of the soon-to-be-murdered child, which resembled those I have seen created by talented schizophrenics? The Japanese original is far more subtle. It is, however, more explicit about the child's demonic origin somewhere in the sea. No Godzilla she but a baleful force whose malevolence continues beyond the grave.'\n",

The main aspect hurts this one is the fact that the main storyline is incredibly flawed and makes little sense. As the ghost wants her body found out, the purpose of making a videotape that originates in a backcountry community that plays only on a locally-broadcasted channel that's supposed to generate interest in solving her mysterious disappearance, an event that's counterintuitive to what she really wants. Rather than bringing a discovery to her situation, placing the means of your discovery should come about rather easily rather than going for a more crowd-friendly atmosphere instead of an isolated and partially obscure part of the country is far more ideal and thus setting up the rampage to follow. Likewise, purposefully killing those who are potentially there to help makes the whole point moot as that shrinks the number of those able to potentially help the cause, really leaving the plot quite troublesome. Beyond that, the fact that the film is just so slowly-paced and lacking of ghost action that the middle segment completely eliminates the killing to focus on the investigation into the video tape's images and source. This is spent more on looking for photographs of the missing couple, visiting the different locations of the classmates such as their school or the cabin in particular where they contracted the curse or sitting around attempting to understand the concept of the curse with her boyfriend as she is getting him to believe in the curse and trying to decipher it all, and none of those are crawling with horrific ideas or concepts. These are practically non-events that while building up the mythos around the legend all tend to prevent this one from really getting going leaving this to drag on to the final twenty minutes. Granted, that's great stuff that happens here, but it comes too little too late to save the rest of the film though it somewhat evens it out to make it borderline watchable. The film's at it's best when detailing the creepy and oftentimes downright chilling atmosphere of the tape, offering up plenty of suspense as they slowly work out the cause and details of the tape. Knowing how the visuals were created and how they came to be affixed onto the tape itself offers this one it's best sense of energy and atmosphere as one-by-one all the pieces slowly work themselves together to realize how their journey ties together. From the distorted photographs leading into the idea of the island and the research they conduct their as well as the revelations about the child in the past which starts to play a prominent role in how this one ends up. From the encounter in the well with the body to the stellar and absolutely chilling sequence with the ghost making one last appearance inside their house for a truly shocking and memorable scare. Coupled with an effective ghost design that's really creepy, these hold this one up.Rated Unrated/R: Violence, Language and intense themes of children-in-jeopardy.'\n",

Even after the American version (THE RING) came along I put that one off, because I was very adamant about seeing the Asian version FIRST. My friend owns both versions on DVD, and he and a few others said the American one was superior, but I decided to do this \"right\". So I went with RINGU.Point is, RINGU was quite a letdown for me. I really hope the U.S. one is better like I've (mostly) heard. I always love a modern horror movie that takes itself seriously and this one surely does, but it's also very uneventful and talky, even for me. Furthermore, I just didn't think it made much sense even though I could see there was a VERY intriguing premise lurking in there somewhere.I just didn't understand how these two people were able to unravel this \"mystery\" and how all the pieces fell so easily into place. And when you start to count the seconds on the DVD counter, that's not a good sign. Things perked up a little at the end, including the chilling demise of the hero... but this film failed to impress me overall.

For the Ring, it is highly successful because the buildup of the movie is slow and the fear slowly crept to you. The Curse Video Segment is fabulous with great screeching sound effect being used. This movie captivate the audiences successfully as they will anticipate what will the fate behold the actor and actress as they are exposed to the video.Finally, the rule of thumb, just like movies The Shining, The Exorcist and Six Sense.

Their friends are full of tales about a tape.Director Hideo Nakata has fashioned an unfussily directed but undeniably creepy ghost story, replete with unsettling images briefly seen and a real feeling of dread.Rather like US horror success stories, this has led to a franchise with (at least) 'Ring 2' (1999) and 'Ring 0' (a prequel, obviously) (2000) and more on the horizon.  Part of me is disappointed at the inevitable dilution of the original which must come with this, but I look forward to seeing them all the same.So far, the original is the only one to have been released in the UK (originally, the sequel was to have come out at the same time, so hopefully it isn't too far off).If you like a good scare, check this one out.'\n",

Before I give you my opinion, I have to say that viewing one of the two movies WILL affect your review of the other one. I guess most people knew about the two movies after the release of the American version [since it's more popular], although Ringu (1998) was popular in Japan but not everywhere else.So, to get things straight, I'm one of those who first saw the American version: Ring (2002). And I'm saying this because it surely affected my opinion on Ringu (1998).Lots and lots of people are going crazy about Ringu (1998), saying it's the better one, and it's the original h blah blah], and the most importantly, more scarier. I even heard [someone acclaimed] that the tape itself looks scarier too [now I found out that wasn't true at all]. From the very beginning you wait to get scared but nothing. Having seen Ring (2002) made me feel like this is not scary at all. To be honest, there was only two or three shots that I felt could be scary, but still not that much scary [and I'm telling you that I get scary easily plus that I find the-very-underrated-horror-movie What Lies Beneath (2000) is the best I've seen in scaring-me-by-the-mood genre]. When comparing Ringu (1998) to Ring (2002), the American version was much better to me. I find the American version as one of my best 5 horror movies. I know that there are people saying this movie wasn't scary, but I don't care. It was scary as hell to me.The best thing about Ringu (1998) is the soundtrack. The music sets the mood, the atmosphere and it's the only thing that proves this as a horror movie. There's a scene where Yoichi Asakawa [son of Ms. Reiko Asakawa] goes upstairs, that was nice. The directing is very good but not all the time. The Cinematography was good and was a big support for the movie. The acting here is good, although nothing special, but at least Nanako Matsushima [Reiko] did a well job. The story was very good, but can be confusing. Some people even didn't understand it either here nor in the American version, but the American version was quite more understandable. There are some differences in the story [for example there are no horses in the Japanese version]. I liked the American-version's story more, because this one [Ringu (1998)] sounds more extraordinary. The best thing about Ringu (1998) against Ring (2002), that Ringu (1998) sets the mood in the entire feature, which is really great to me. The best horror movies should always set the mood for enough length of time. A great example of setting the mood is Signs (2002). I don't think the American version laked this, since it kinda does set the mood somehow, it didn't leave a space for me to feel a need to have my mood set. I still have to give 4 stars out of 5 for setting the mood. Here is a high-suspense movie in which you even feel something scary was going to happen [almost] every moment in the process. The thing is that there almost weren't any scary scenes to hold up to that great atmosphere and mood . Check out What Lies Beneath (2000) & The Sixth Sense (1999) to understand what I mean. I have three points to raise here: 1- The Japanese language which I'm sure most of you don't understand it so you will waste your time reading the subtitles [instead of watching the movie] just trying to keep up with the dialogue. 2- The cultural differences which we are again unfamiliar with. 3- The whole new-American-movie-generation thing meaning we became unable to wait for something to happen for so long. We want stuff to happen, we want it now and we want a lot of it! [Aliens (1986)] In addition, Spielberg once said that if he made [the masterpiece] Jaws (1975) now after more than 25 years people won't get excited to it, because we learned to become impatient [and I believe he's right]. One last thing, is that everybody says low-budget never necessarily means bad, so why does high-budget [Ring (2002)] means bad this time?Bottom line: Someone said a theory that says: \"Everyone who saw Ring (2002) first seems to have liked it more than Ringu (1998) and vise versa\". So, to you, I guess you should see Ringu (1998) before Ring (2002). To me, I choose Ring (2002).3.5/5.0'\n",

            "Review: 'This film I saw the first time after the American remake. I must thank them, because if they had not made that version, I might never have known this existed. Getting into podcasts and learning more of the history, I do think that is a bit of hyperbole. I'll be honest, after my first few watches, I still preferred the remake. It wasn't until more recently that shifted. I've had the opportunity to see this in the theater for my last few viewings, in 4K for a couple of them.Synopsis: a reporter and her ex-husband investigate a cursed video tape that is rumored to kill the viewer seven days after watching it.We begin with two young women sitting in a room watching baseball. Masami (Hitomi Satô) is telling a story to Tomoko Ôishi (Yûko Takeuchi). She tells her about a tape that when you watch it someone calls to inform you that you will die in seven days. Tomoko becomes very serious and states she has seen this, but then laughs it off. She reveals that she went on a trip a week ago with a boy and another couple. The phone then rings and she becomes serious again. She admits to seeing the cursed tape. The call is from her mother letting her know that she will be home later. The two laugh it off, but something happens to Tomoko.We then shift to a reporter, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima). She's heard about this tape and is investigating it for a story. She interviews three young women and learns that the same area's name keeps coming up, Izu. Reiko then returns home where we see that she has a son, Yôichi (Rikiya Ôtaka). He's quite independent, getting himself ready as well as getting his mother's dress out for her.This is when we learn that the young woman who died at the beginning was her niece. She goes to her sister's house for the wake, which her sister is understandable distraught over what happened. We hear strange things about what happens and Reiko seeks out Tomoko's friends to see what she can learn. This leads her to all the friends that went on the trip died the same day at roughly the same time.Reiko continues her investigation which leads her to the same cabin that her niece went to. It's there she finds a copy of the tape and watches it herself. She seeks out her ex, Ryûji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada) to help her investigate this. It is partly because he's a psychic. She shows him the video and gives him a copy. This leads them down a dark path involving a well and a family that also had psychic abilities.That's where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the character. Where I'll start is that I'm glad that I've seen this movie multiple times. Watching it with a critical eye the last few times helped me to understand what this is going for. The first couple times I saw it, I didn't care for it. I now appreciate this original film even more. For a long time, I still preferred the remake. That is no longer the case though. The dark mystery gets scary if I'm honest. I also never really put together that it is based on a novel which I do want to check out.What is interesting is that Reiko knows about the cursed tape already. It seems to be an urban legend, that everyone knows about as they all seem to have 'someone they know knows someone who knows'. She is doing an investigative report on it, so I like that aspect. She has a bit of knowledge before it happens to Tomoko. It's interesting that she does the interview and then is shocked when she goes to the wake that it pops up there. This makes her want to get to the bottom of it even more. It gives more of a bonus to figure out the mystery for her.Something else I like about this one is the ex, Mai. He works better here than in the remake. His being a psychic felt more like a convenience. Knowing more about the culture, the Japanese tend to be more spiritual. That is what it feels like. It is also easier to reveal the back story that way and we can see it play out as well. What I am glad about is that this doesn't play up the creepiness of Yôichi. He's more there to raise tension and these parents need to solve the mystery.I will say that this one does play out much more like a slow burn. It does pick it up though as the investigation goes on. I should also say this doesn't waste time either. The creepy images are downplayed here as well. I go back and forth which version, this or the remake has the creepier images on the tape. This last time made me feel uncomfortable with this one. I do love the darkness of the ending here. The whole last ten minutes of this film are worth the build up.That moves me to the acting. I thought that Matsushima was solid as the lead. I do find it interesting she knows about the tape. She is strong, but as time is winding down, we see her break. I thought that was a solid touch to end her performance and what she ultimately decides to do. On top of that, she's not a great mother as she leaves her son alone a lot of the time despite him being in 1st grade. It is intriguing she's a modern woman, worrying about her career in a place like Japan that focuses on family as much as it does. She is also quite attractive. Sanada was also solid in his role. I like his character overall. He is kind of nonchalant as well, but that is probably how I'd be. It is seeing his ex-wife breaking down that changes him. He also experiences things that makes him urgent. I do have to give shout-outs to Takeuchi, Satô, Numata and the rest of the cast, they do round out the film for what is needed. This includes Rie Ino'o as Sadako Yamamura.Something I was surprised by was the lack of effects. We do get aspects like making the scene flip its black and white aspect, which I thought was fine to show when something happened in the past. The tape in this film is creepy, but in a different way from the remake. This is limited to the effects used. To be honest, it doesn't need them either. I think it conveys what it needs to. The look of the entity was scary and makes me feel uneasy when we see it. Cinematography doesn't necessarily stand out, but it also worked for what was needed.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. Early in the movie I didn't notice and it wasn't until the tension started going up that I did. It is quite subtle and yet creepy. I love the underlying noise while the film is playing. It isn't one that I would listen to regularly, but it helps build a brooding and uneasy feeling, which I noticed during my most recent viewings.In conclusion, I've come to the idea that this is a much better movie than the remake. I tried not to compare them throughout and only do so when needed. This film is more of a dark mystery that has great horror moments. There's a brooding feeling throughout. I think the concept of how spiritual the Japanese are plays well with what they develop. This film is more of a slow burn, which I enjoy. There are good concepts. The acting is good. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but what we get I think are solid. The look of the entity is great. It terrifies me to be honest. The soundtrack is subtle, but I think it drives the tension. I think this film is great overall. Now I did watch it in Japanese with subtitles. If that's an issue, I would avoid it. If not and you like dark mysteries, I'd give this one a viewing.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10.'\n",

            "Review: 'Nakata's ominous J-horror that commenced a franchise both in its native country and picked up by Hollywood, has been recycled, parodied and analysed countless times in the past two decades. Having never seen the original, I was concerned that the unusually excellent American remake and hilariously defiant 'Scary Movie 3' would taint my judgement. \"Cindy, the TV's leaking!\". Fortunately, Nakata's gloriously astute direction unravels this mysterious phenomenon with a layer of timelessness and genuine fear, that fully held my attention. After watching a tape that grants her seven days to live, a mother and her ex-husband attempt to uncover the mystery of the tape before she meets her abrupt demise.Continuing the trend with most hybrid horrors in Japanese cinema that were introduced in the 90s, the terrifying elements were handled through technically profound execution. Jump scares were non-existent. An absent score ramped up the suppressed tension. And lingering static shots with background changes, such as a ghostly figure lurking in the shadows, haunt the imagination. Yet despite the ominous aura that shrouded the cursed video tape, the central narrative itself was what truly enchanted.Dabbling into themes of technological repression, motherhood and modernity, the supernaturally mentalistic aesthetic that plagued Ringu made for an interesting directorial choice by Nakata. Takahashi's script often exploring avenues on mentalism and traditional yurei archetypes found in several ghostly J-horrors. It made for a refreshing, slowly paced mystery that was able to relish in Suzuki's original source material. Bolstering two fantastic central performances by Matsushima and Sanada, Nakata never loses focus on the chemistry between these two divorcees, as they travel to Izu Oshima captured in Hayashi's absolute gorgeous cinematography. It's incredibly rare for a horror to intently concentrate on the characters whilst moving effortlessly along with the plot. And by the third act when a certain well is discovered, well, you'll be watching through your fingers.Unfortunately, Nakata does not conclude the film there. Instead, a minuscule plot twist is realised and unsurprisingly didn't suit the authentic mystery that preceded it. It purposefully opened up to a sequel, which was ironically released and rapidly forgotten about at the same time (entitled 'Rasen'), and failed to round off the mystery of the video tape adequately. Did it leave me wanting to watch the \"new\" sequel? Of course, but the final ten minutes were not a result of that. Due to the reasonably short runtime, Takahashi forces a substantial amount of exposition during the second act that briskly moved the mystery along without much depth. Characters like Shizuko and Takashi become mere plot devices as opposed to genuine humans.Still, Ringu's influence on the horror genre must be noted, for it started a new wave of ghostly tales. Nakata's technical involvement, accompanied by sterling performances and an uneasy central mystery, elevated the scares and ensured the horror comes crawling out of the television. Oh, and adored the ominous sound effects that complimented the onscreen countdown. Reminded me of 'Clocktower 3'...'\n",

They laugh about it but when one of the girls dies minutes later her journalist aunt sets out to investigate when it transpires that three of her school friends died the same day. Their only common link is that they rented a cabin the week before and watched a supposedly cursed video.Tracking down the cabin, the journalist finds the video, watches it, receives a call which tells her she will be dead in one week, and then she tries to work out where the video originated. With the help of her ex-husband she begins to piece together the story behind the video and the likelihood that there is truth to the curse. Every so often she experiences strange visions and a sense of dread begins to build up.This is an excellent film and one scene, where one person suffers the consequences of the curse is extremely chilling.

            "Review: 'I have just watched Ringu and the sequel at the annual night film festival here in my home town of Copenhagen and what at treat! The first film is by far the better although the sequel isn´t bad either, it just can´t compare with the first one.The outline of the film has been told several times in other user comments, so I would just like to point out a few details I found interesting.The Ringu saga integrates modern and ancient myths to combine the background for the tragic and horrible story it tells. For many this integration of modern and ancient constitutes a key to the understanding of the Japanese.It is interesting the way the writers have expanded the universe of the story as we go into the second chapter. I haven´t read the novel so unfortunately I´m unaware if the author dealt with the topics told in Ringu2.But the force of this film is the continuation from the point where Ringu ended. (An ending that has to be seen, to be believed!) To compensate for this Ringu2 opens with a psychological shock, when we are told about the plight of the poor Sadako in the well.So we pick up where we left the antagonists of the first film, but cleverly the film takes focus on fresh characters. These are introduced in Ringu but left at the periphery of the story. Therefore the theme of the ring, of inevitability becomes stronger as they are dragged into the flux of things in the second chapter. The main characters of the first chapter still play an important role because they make up an integral part of the background story.The focus on the ancient myth building is a welcome insight into the old ways of Japan, as we visit the underwater cave in Ringu2, where the unwanted new born are left for the tide . It becomes clear that the birth of Sadako is the main catalyst of the story; Just the first of many horrible events to occur. However we are still left to ponder the identity of Sadako´s father, which is hinted at in Ringu but downplayed somewhat in R2.That´s all for me folks, I hope you enjoyed my ramblings. I´ll end with suggesting that you CATCH THESE MOVIES IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!!'\n",

I have to say I was equally enthralled by the original, in fact in some elements found it to be superior.  The key to this films appeal is the way the suspense, horror and unease is built with no gore or real action. It is just a slow relentless ramping up of suspense and the dark foreboding which is accentuated by the dark moody filming. I feel this is where this film scores over the re-make. The hollywood version comes across as slow and almost boring , in comparison. There is one key defining scene in both films (which I wont reveal of course)and , I have to say, this was done better in the new version. This is a great film but I think that comments like \"best horror ever\" are a bit over the top. Overall I would say, a great suspenseful example of sheer horror without the gore.'\n",

            "Review: '\"Ringu\" tells the story of a cursed videotape. Whoever watches it dies exactly seven days later. The story lacks all logic, but is very tense all the same.One reason maybe that you know in advance who will die and when. Hitchcock once said that when a bomb explodes there is a shock effect and when you tell the viewer that there is a bomb ticking there is suspense. In the first instance neither the characters in the movie nor the viewer knows anathing about the bomb. In the second instance the viewer knows, but the characters in the movie don't know. The situation in \"Ringu\" is still different. After watching the video both the viewer and the character in the movie knows his is cursed.Another reason why the film works despite its lack of logic maybe the innocence of the victims. In the Agatha Christie story \"And then there were none\" (1939) the invitees are also cursed, but they are anything but innocent.Remarkable is that director Gore Verbinski has tried to put a litte more logic in the American remake of 2002 and that as a result of this the remake lost some of its effect.There are a couple of movie quotes in the film. The most obvious comparison is of course with \"Videodrome\" (1983, David Cronenberg), but to me the most powerfull movie quote was with \"The omen\" (1976, Richard Donner). Just like in \"The omen\" you can't see in reality that a person is cursed, but you do see it on a photograph of this person.'\n",

            "Review: 'If you haven't, watch Ringu first.If you have, watch Ringu as well.Hideo Nakata's Ringu is a shining example of how to make an eerie, unsettling, frightening piece of cinema without the typical western approach of employing a plethora of sudden jumps and gory scares. He creates an atmosphere that builds in intensity and gradually draws the viewer in ever deeper. In scenes where a Hollywood director would make the viewer jump, Nakata directs in a way that gradually increases the viewer's discomfort.Some reviewers have stated that there is no gore in this movie at all; but that isn't the case. There is some understated gore that is used as a vehicle to drive the plot and to build tension.In some ways, The Ring is a scarier remake, with some scenes amped up in their horrific intensity and via the use of CGI. Ringu, on the other hand, excels in its ability to scare the viewer via the sheer creepiness and unsettling nature of the atmosphere and scenes. Sure, The Ring had that too, but Ringu shows how effective this can be while remaining understated in comparison.If you've already seen the American remake, this movie likely won't scare you as much. Partly because you already know some of what will happen. But that's not to say that Ringu isn't a very scary movie. It's just handled with a more refined touch, and with better character development behind the reason for the terror.It is for these reasons that Ringu comes across as the better movie. Whilst The Ring was a very good movie, it can't quite match the genius of the original.'\n",

On its own terms, however, RING is a huge disappointment. Things get off to a bad start with the opening teaser, a slow-burning 'scare' scene which builds toward nothing more than a lacklustre freeze-frame, ruining the intended effect, and the subsequent narrative relies too heavily on mood to be truly effective. Nakata generates tension through a gradual accumulation of details, as Matsushima and Sanada follow a series of clues to a remote island where they uncover the identity of a 'character' in the cursed video, whose restless spirit seeks vengeance for a past transgression. The movie closes on a scene of stunning, visceral horror (impressionable viewers are warned that this sequence is *profoundly* frightening), but it's the only highlight of an otherwise mediocre movie. Nakata has since built a career on such material (CHAOS, DARK WATER, etc.). Followed by RING 2 (1999) and the tangentially-related THE SPIRAL (1998).(Japanese dialogue)'\n",

            "Review: 'Ring is the first movie of the famous Japanese horror film franchise based upon Nakata Hideo's cult novel of the same title from the early nineties. The movie was released simultaneously with its direct sequel Spiral. The former movie was met with critical acclaim at home and abroad and led to the creation of a series of influential Japanese horror movies such as The Grudge, Pulse and Dark Water during the next few years.This movie is different from its more violent, fast and explicit Western counterparts of the nineties. Ringu has a slow and at times even dragging pace. It attempts to tell a detailed story with intriguing characters instead of focusing on bloodshed and visual effects. The movie relies on its sinister atmosphere and avoids predictable jump scares. Only the final thirty minutes quicken up the pace and conclude in the franchise's most memorable scene.The film deals with a cursed videotape that kills whoever watches it within a week. After the tragic death of her niece, investigative reporter Asakawa Reiko wants to get more information about the mysterious short film. She finds the tape in a remote cabin where her niece and her friends had stayed for a weekend. Intrigued by the gloomy urban legend, Reiko watches the tape herself and soon feels cursed, isolated and nervous. She asks her intellectual ex-husband Takayama Ryuji for help. Things become more tense when their son unsuspectingly also watches the cursed tape. The professor and the reporter must travel to the island of Izu Oshima where parts of the tape seem to have been recorded. They discover that a psychic who committed suicide and her mysteriously vanished daughter seem to be related to the tape but their family members react with open hostility towards the investigations. As time is running out for the mother, father and son, they have to solve the origin of the curse to save their lives.If you expect Ring to be scary, intense and brutal, you should avoid watching it. This is a highly atmospheric, character-driven and slow-paced horror movie. Its target audience are people who are interested in Japanese culture and prefer a more intellectual approach to drama, horror and mystery genres. Ring is certainly an unusual approach for Western audiences and can be considered an acquired tense. Despite a few lengths, Ring is however creative, detailed and profound enough to keep you watching until the very end. Thanks to its uniqueness, this film ultimately deserves its excellent reputation as pioneer movie that propulsed Japanese horror cinema to international acclaim.'\n",

You can very much follow this even though it is in Japanese and you can imagine it actually happening.The part where Sadako (the ghost) crawls out the TV is the scariest thing I have ever witnessed. The whole audience jumped back in their seats, literally crawled back away from it. I myself did that swearing while trying to catch my breath. All around me I could hear pants of \"F**k, S**t, Jesus & Oh My God\"If that whole terrifying moment wasn't bad enough, the one thing that sticks in my mind is towards the end when the dead husband appears with the cloth over his head pointing towards the video. That image is actually hard to talk about without me frightening myself.It's not cowardly or lame to be afraid of this film. This film is something very believable. I recently bought the DVD which, in the extra features section had \"THE TAPE\" that was featured in the film. Me and a friend watched it and immediately after made a copy and next day sent it on. We didn't get a call but neither did the husband did he...? Or the son? So I'm not taking any chances.I will never watch this film alone, especially not at night.

The Japanese version is slightly different, but with the same plot, though this time it reveals more about Sadako (who is Samara in the US version) and her mother's abilities of phychic powers.

The character of the the female protagonist's kid doesn't seem to have much substacne and you don't really feel the connection with him that you did with Aidan in the remake.

Those who have seen the remake (wich is IMO not scary whatsoever, sometimes plain laughable, often annoying) may be dissapointed and like the remake better for these reasons:The remake's pace is quicker. The remake is American. The remake has better special effects.I don't think any of these is a reason to like the American version better. First of all, a slow pace is one of the best ways to create suspense and a creepy atmosphere. Of course it's important to make the movie go slow, whitout making it boring. Ringu succeeds in this perfectly and made me be scared all the time. The fact that the remake is American and this one is Japanese has nothing to do with the quality. Some might be annoyed by the subtitles, but I'm used to reading them and I had no problem with the language. Then, the remake has better special effects... You can argue about that. I don't agree with it. I think the original has better special effects because it has no special effects. In The Ring, you get to see a (laughable) monster face that belongs in an Excorcist parody. In Ringu, the only thing you get to see of Sadako's face is her eye. Now to me, that's ten times as scary as ten thousand of these freaky monsters.

I'm an ardent supporter of independent filmmaking, foreign and otherwise, but I just don't think this one is as good the American version.First, what's been done right.  This is definitely scary.  It's also got a bit written in that its American counterpart doesn't.  _Ringu_ steeps itself in an entire supernatural mythology that drags you in and refuses to let go. It also tends to explain things more than American horror does generally, and I approve of that.  I'll also say that Sadako is no doubt one of the most disturbing things I've seen lately.Where this film falls short, though, is atmosphere.  Nakata gives us a fantastic story but he can't consistently craft an atmosphere of suspense for an hour and a half.  Sure, there are some _great_ scenes.  (*The* scene at the end of the movie where Ryuji happens to look over his shoulder and see the television is fantastic.)  Despite this, the film is too choppy and gives the audience too many breaks in the action to be really scary throughout.  Admittedly, this seems to be a unique characteristic of much of Japanese cinema.  I'm aware that there are cultural differences leading to this sort of thing, but this is a difference that just doesn't translate very well for me.The death scenes are just cheesy.  Period.

The quality of the VHS version isn't great, but in a way that serves to make it more eerie and atmospheric as it appears similar to the video central to the plot. My one qualm would have to be with the lighting, which although adding tension in some scenes (at the bottom of the well for one) does make it slightly annoying. That said it is an excellent and truly creepy film, and walking home in the dark as I did once it had finished is certainly not advised. I give it 9/10, bring on Ringu 2'\n",

            "Review: 'Nakata Hideo's twisty-turny horror movie, based on series of novels by Suzuki Koji, borrows motifs from such diverse genre pics as VIDEODROME, CANDYMAN and ONIBABA. Mix in a healthy dose of one of X-FILES better episodes and a closing shot ripped straight from THE TERMINATOR and you'd probably expect an unholy mess. Well, you'd be half right because this is one of the most disturbing cinematic experiences in recent memory. The premise, a cursed videotape that dooms the viewer to a bizarre death exactly one week after watching it, may seem hard to swallow but Nakata plays it straight and an atmosphere of dread pervades the film. Characterisation is minimal but effective with good performances from the two leads as an estranged husband and wife fighting against time to save themselves and their young son from the curse. What really makes this film work though, in ways that superficially similar Hollywood efforts often don't, is a plot that constantly throws suprises at you right up until the final scenes. There is also some startling and genuinly unsettling imagery and very clever editing. RINGU may be nothing more than an effective little shocker but it makes most big budget Hollywood \"psychological thrillers\" look as anaemic as Sadako, the melancholy spirit at the center of the madness.

            "Review: 'I'm not a horror aficionado, as I may have confessed elsewhere here in these reviews. I did intentionally want to see this film rather than the American remake, as it just seems like the right thing to do. But this ended up being a \"eh\" for me.I had seen the trailers of the US Ring with the well and the odd movements of the long-haired lass and found that mesmerizing. And in this film that scene as well as the entire video meme and other sorts of 'Dead Zone' shocks of sight were enjoyable to watch. I could have used more of such scenes and certainly more explication of the powers of certain characters in the past and present.However honestly, twice I fell asleep while watching this. I think some of the language gets lost in translation, as well as the harrowing horror of the stink-eye faces of death (isn't this something from Japanese art of old)? Americans tend to go for the physical detaching of limbs in horror, where in Japanese film it looks like it is the fear felt during the detaching of life which is so frightening. (And probably a more realistic fear for the every man).There were other elements I enjoyed about this film, the sea village life and the ocean claiming its annual sacrificial victims. The idea of the video as a virus (I'm sure someone on here has already mentioned the actual name of the video that was making kids nauseous in Japan...I cannot recall it.)Hard to pass up on the Luddite justification, i.e. not only is a VCR deadly but it must be coupled with a telephone as well.... The undertheme of sexual activity among teenagers, at least in the early deaths, linked to horror always a classic.The pace of the film was different, (or were they stretching the story out)...but more moments of actors/actresses just gazing was different, if not perhaps a little too soporific.Culture wise, something as simple as the houses being so sparsely decorated was something else I noticed. Overall, not enough to warrant this as a must-rent...one last comment, especially when juxtaposed against the majority of drab decor...the opening scene with the prominent product placement of an American peanut jar and a cracker box stood out...I'm afraid to wager that these were airbrushed in for the US release... The omnipresent commercial, now that's scary...5/10'\n",

On the other hand, I was compelled to add my own personal reaction to this movie and the reason I found it so impressive. I was convinced that no horror movie could ever scare me. I had taken the mind set that \"It's just a movie! What's to be scared of?\"  I've gotta tell you that \"Ring\" came along and blew me away.  I was scared senseless. Other movies/shows had succeeded in creeping me out a bit: \"The Shining\", \"House on Haunted Hill\"(the 1999 version. Fun at some places but downright unnerving at others!), and \"Twin Peaks\" to name almost all of 'em. And recently, \"The Mothman Prophecies\" was a welcome addition to the list. Oh, and Stephen King's \"Rose Red\" too!  I even let my imagination loose and allowed myself to be bothered by the infamous \"Blair Witch\". I've also enjoyed many an ominous Lovecraft story. The point is that as much as these things disturbed me to an extent, none of them compare to \"Ring\".  Any movie that has the ability to give me an unbearable cramp in my leg from remaining tense and breathless for an hour and a half and bestow upon me a fear of the dark (and of my television of course) has to be doing something right! Even now, months after my first viewing, I don't think I have the courage to watch it by myself in the dark. \"Ring\" did what I had thought no movie could do... it terrified me. I never knew I could have such a psychological and emotional reaction from a mere movie. I was proven wrong (BOY was I proven wrong) and it has renewed my faith in the horror genre. A horror movie that actually terrifies? Wow, what a concept!  One more thing.... I defy you to find a more terrifying presence than Sadako!'\n",

            "Review: 'Having seen hundreds of horror movies, the genre rarely scares me anymore, but I am still vulnerable to being caught up in the tension and suspense of a well-played scene.  Ringu had plenty of those.  The style of the film is subdued and haunting, and the dialogue, although sparse, is well-delivered and effective.  I did not feel that the mood was compromised by the subtitles.  The special effects, which are admittedly less spectacular than in the Hollywood version, were still gripping and creepy.  The music was wonderful, fitted the scenes well, and underscored the suspense without being overwrought and heavy-handed as is with so many U.S. made horror movies.  Even though I knew the plot of the movie beforehand, I was caught up in the drama and suspense and found myself holding my breath and jumping, even when I knew what was coming next.  In my opinion, that's a sign of a good horror film.There were several small touches that I really enjoyed.  The back story on why the couple in the movie divorced was deftly handled in a succinct and poignant scene.  The mother's relationship with her little boy is also very touching and realistic.  The actors captured perfectly the dread and horror one would have in realizing their fate, should they fail to solve the mystery.  The acting was excellent, easily as good as is seen in classic Kurosawa films and the more contemporary Takeshi Kitano movies.If you're looking for a gore fest or a scream-a-minute movie, this ain't it. However, if you enjoy psychological dramas with supernatural elements and the sort of horror that sneaks up on you and continues to make your skin crawl long after the movie is over, this is your pick.  **** out of 5 stars.'\n",

(The latest instalment, a horror comedy called Sadako RDX was literally released in 2022).When revisiting these classic movies, it's tempting to look at their towering legacy and not at the merits of the film itself. Ringu, however, is an easy recommendation because it's a good movie, plain and simple. And, I can't help but compare it to the American remake, which, while pretty good, isn't as good as this one.I really liked the cinematography; I know that may seem like a weird thing to comment on, but I couldn't help but admire how this film LOOKED. There's a banal realism to a lot of this movie and maybe it's a nostalgic look at Japan in the 90s that appeals to me, but it just immediately captured my attention from the opening frame. Compared to the dark blue and grey of the original, this one just worked for me.I also GREATLY prefer the performances in this one compared to the remake; Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) and Ryuji (absolute boss Hiroyuki Sanada - you'll recognize him) feel more normal and less cold than the characters in the American remake and their actors have much better chemistry. Yoichi (Reiko's son) is so much better than the weird alien child we get in the American version - Aidan. Given that the people in the film feel more realistic, I didn't mind watching them, even if that's a lot of the movie.This is an admittedly slow movie, but it's never boring. Yes, we all know where the story leads, but it's compelling enough to keep hold of you. The sense of tension is palpable, especially with the countdown, and the slow realization of what's really going on coming at you. I think the final half hour of this movie is absolutely brilliant.And of course, THAT ENDING. Wow. I knew it was coming but it was still absolutely terrifying and brilliant. Ending of a cliffhanger like that was a bold move and had me turn on the sequel (more on that) right after. Ringu is an exercise in patience and pay off.Yeah, this was an awesome movie. It took me way too long to watch it, but I highly recommend it to fans of foreign horror.'\n",

Based on the first novel of Suzuki Koji's best-selling trilogy, \"Ring\" introduces its audience to the story of Sadako, a young girl with super-natural powers who is killed by her father and dumped into a well in rural Japan with the intent of halting her eventual transformation into a demon.  Such as it is, however, this murder serves only to set the evil force within Sadako free and it is subsequently linked to a mysterious video cassette (the origins of, and Sadako's relationship to which, are never explained) that, when watched, marks the viewers for death at Sadako's hands exactly one week after their having viewed it.  \"Ring\" follows two of these people as they search for a way to avert their fated appointment. Beautifully crafted through careful non-sequential editing, the movie draws the viewer into the plot in a way that goes beyond the conventional cinematic explanations of voyeuristic theory or suturing. . . \"Ring\" is terrifying because in watching it, the audience is marked for death as well. Accompanied by a terrific score and excellent all-around performances (something you don't really expect from a horror movie), it is a film well worth your time and any lack of sleep which may result from watching it. Blood and gore fans please take note: \"Ring\" deals with the psychological foundations of fear, playing on your mind's ability to recognize the subtle, therein eschewing scenes of grotesque violence.  If you want to be seriously scared, this is your movie.  If you want to be able to laugh, or to sleep after watching a horror film, try looking at some of Wes Craven's work.'\n",

On one hand, Ringu shows a good Japanese horror story progression; on the other hand, Ringu takes liberty to change Mr. Suzuki's story into something shallower and easier to implement.Ringu is not the first adaptation of Ring by Koji Suzuki, the first adaptation is a TV-targeted movie called, well, Ring from 1995. Ring (1995) better adapts the novel; Ringu does a good job too, but you see the changes from minute 0.In Ringu, we follow female journalist Reiko Asakawa who is investigating the death of her niece. Reiko also happens to be covering the urban legend about a cursed videotape that kills whoever watches it. So, from the get-go, Ringu dismisses some of the investigative work that Mr. Suzuki sets on his novel, probably trying to increase the pacing of the action.Clairvoyance plays a big factor on Ringu, applying some Ex-Machina to certain moments where the plot converges into complicated lines. These convenient insights adds too much casuality, which diminishes mystery tension. Anytime the characters seem to hit a wall, a vision seems to set them back into the right path.The horror elements are abrupt, resorting on shock factors and jumpscares, most of them effective, but also annoying and repetitive. However, kudos to Sadako, especially her death gaze, a classic frame on horror history.Ringu is an effective adaptation, though not entirely fateful to the source content. Ringu takes liberty to change complicated plotlines and heavy plotlines, toning down the violence of the original story, but maintaining its overall arc. A recommendable movie for horror fans.'\n",

Some of them were simply laughable as something was lost in the translation.Overall, I enjoyed this film quite a bit.

After he watches it, the phone never rings. I was left thinking, 'Hmmm. It didn't work for him.' But, later, he says to his ex-wife, 'I only have one more day than you,' meaning the phone must have rang but they just didn't show it. I found that very odd. Same thing occurs after their little boy watches it. The phone does not ring but we are led to believe the boy is also in danger.Good movie and my first taste of Japanese horror outside of Godzilla (not really horror I know). I did enjoy \"The Ring\" more but this story interests me enough to where I would definitely like to see the next Japanese Ringu movie if I can get my hands on it.'\n",

            "Review: 'The thing I like best about Japanese horror is the sense of atmosphere. The use of lingering, slow burning tension, when a character approaches a closed door that we know they shouldn't open, but we still want them too regardless. For me, it's everything that horror should be. No gratuitous gore, no shock MTV style montages; just a slow, lingering feeling of dread that grows with intensity from one scene to the next. It also helps that the majority of these films are directed with flair and imagination, whilst - for the most part at least - offering us intelligent characters and interesting scenarios.Ringu (1998), or The Ring as it is more commonly known, is largely considered to be the first major release to kick-start the recent revival of Asian horror/supernatural cinema in the west. As a result, it has probably lost some of its initial appeal since first gaining cult-notoriety as a straight to video picture ten years ago (doesn't time fly?); with countless parodies, rip-offs and the inevitable Hollywood remake all detracting from the original film's sense of slow burning mystery and suspense. Now, I'm certainly not going to pretend that I was amongst the very first wave of viewers to champion the film; especially since I only got around to experiencing it after having already witnessed the 2002 Hollywood version, as well as having experienced countless other Asian horror films, such as The Eye (2000), A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) and Ju On: The Grudge (2003). It must also be said here that all three of those particular examples excited and enveloped me much more than any fastidious viewing of Ringu; although again, this is perhaps down to how iconic and over familiar the images of the film have become from the innumerable references that have been made to it in the name of popular culture, as well as something of a process of refinement; with each subsequent Ringu-knock off expanding and elaborating upon the template set here.Like Psycho (1960), The Exorcist (1973) and countless Spielberg blockbusters, Ringu has become one of those iconic films that are familiar to audiences who have yet to experience even a single frame. As a result, you could probably call the film a victim of its own success, or maybe even something that really needs to be experienced within the context of which it was originally created. You also have to try and disassociate yourself from the hype; something that seems to have confused certain viewers and led them to lash out at the film with a plethora of one-star reviews because it perhaps failed to deliver on what someone on the Internet suggested it would. This isn't really a fault of the film, as obviously, different people will always like different things; with the majority of Asian horror being so deeply rooted in the religious, historical and social conventions, concerns and taboos of actual Asian culture that it will always going to require a certain element of compromise on the part of an audience more familiar with westernised horror cinema; which tends to place more emphasis on sex and violence (be it psychological, or merely physical).Like the subsequent, similarly-themed films that came in its wake - such as Audition (1999), Ju On: The Grudge and director Hideo Nakata's own ensuing feature, Dark Water (2002) - the horror of Ringu looks back to the days of the slow-burning, classical Japanese horror of films such as Kwaidan (1964), Onibaba (1964) and Kuroneko (1968); films that perhaps don't seem all that horrific to a more adventurous or desensitised audience, with the horror really coming from the personification of ghosts and demons, or the sense of taboo. There's also elements of social commentary, with the idea of home entertainment pushing people further outside of society and allowing them to wallow in loneliness and alienation; an idea that is further developed in Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Pulse (2001). So, it was and still is a kind of horror that the majority of UK/US viewers were unaccustomed to, and this in itself is one of the reasons why I'm so fond of this particular style of film-making, and Japanese cinema as a whole. It also worked as a great gimmick too, with the idea of an audience renting a video about a tape that causes anyone who watches it to drop dead. This, for me, only added to the sinister atmosphere of foreboding menace; especially as I watched it alone at 2:30 in the morning (really the best time to experience any kind of horror film, in my opinion).Although admittedly less immediate in terms of shocks than the Ju On series, and a lot less thematically successful than similarly minded Asian horror such as The Eye and A Tale of Two Sisters, Ringu is still a solid piece of supernatural mystery and suspense. Yes, it is slow, and yes, it might require more than a single viewing to get the full effect, but it does stand up surprisingly well; even though I'm sure most potential viewers will know the broader aspects of the plot already. Ringu is definitely a film for anyone who appreciates interesting characters, intelligent and deliberately-paced plotting, and an atmosphere of claustrophobic and foreboding dread.'\n",

            "Review: 'This film is the film that started the whole Asian horror remake fad that's been popular in the US as of late. Not that Hollywood hasn't been happy to remake movies from all over the world, but Ringu is at the start of it all. Having seen it, I can see some of the appeal.Ringu is a rather quiet movie that doesn't rely on a ton of scares. Rather, it works to create a sense of unease and impending doom and uses the suspense from that knowledge to propel the entertainment of the film forward. The story is essentially about an investigative reporter, while investigating the death of her niece, discovers a bizarre video that upon watching curses you to die within exactly one week of watching it. As her ex-husband gets drawn into the matter, they find themselves fighting a week-long deadline (pun intended) to find out how to reverse the curse, lest they meet the same terrible fate of the four high-schoolers that unfortunately met the tape before.One underlying commentary I found really interesting about the story was the relationship between the ex-es and how, although they clearly are no longer together for a reason, they still can't fully leave each other entirely either. I also like some of the running mythology about ESP and mental powers as it all helps the story make some good amount of sense. Both of these are different from the novel, which actually has a male protagonist and his snarky professor-friend racing to save their lives. The snarky professor friend isn't a psychic, but just brilliant and insightful, if a bit strange. Making the changes really helps the ghost-story aspect of the film to work well as well as providing a medium to tell a story about relationships as well.The overall film looks pretty good for a Japanese film from 1998. The direction is decent, good at building and maintaining suspense. I don't know if there's anything wrong with the acting; due to cultural differences, I accepted what I saw as what ought to be in terms of reactions, but I generally thought it was all pretty believable. I can't remember the score or the mixing, so I can't comment about that either. Visuals are a strong point, with a rather creepy video and some creepy images of death. I like the rhythm of the film, which builds like an atmospheric mystery that slowly unfolds, rather than a jumpy spookfest.While the film does lack in serious substance, I really like the understory about relationships and I wasn't really a fan of the novel's ending (which is somewhat replicated here), it still left me satisfied after watching it. I can't tell you how scary the film is because I've pretty much completely desensitized myself to scary movies, but I know that a lot of people I know were creeped out by the thing, so if you're looking for chills, you can probably still get them here. What we have is an above average horror film with a high-concept premise that pulls you through to the end. It's rather good for a horror film and if horror is what you're looking for, this is a good film to check out. 7/10.'\n",

So I was very disappointed when it turned out that the original didn't have the storyline depth or intense creepiness of the American remake.One of the most creepy aspects of The Ring was the video itself. The images on it were surreal, abstract, yet meaningful. In Ringu, the video was much, much shorter - and far less creepy. Because it was a shorter video, it had much less clues to the curse - and became part of the reason it was a shorter movie.As a matter of fact, if I had watched the two versions of the film back to back with no previous knowledge of which was made first, I would have guessed the American version was the original. The American version had much more depth concerning the history of Samara. These type of details (which I felt added to the American version) were left out of the Japanese version - so the original seemed like an edited version of the American version. It actually felt like a shorter remake of The Ring.I really was hoping for Ringu to blow me away even further than The Ring had. Instead, I hold this as one of the prime examples that Hollywood can indeed improve upon a foreign movie.'\n",

Like any good horror movie it keeps the basic idea simple but frightening  a mysterious video tape is floating around. Those who watch the video tape have a week to live after seeing it. A reporter, Reiko Asakawa, decides to investigate the truths (and lies) surrounding this and finds herself drawn into a world (mandolins please) of terror!The idea of watching TV killing you is a neat one, as is the race-against-time if you watch it (take a wild guess as to whether the heroine sees it). As you may be watching the movie on a video, as I was, it shows a little touch of genius as the supernatural, often constrained to cultures of yore, manages to enter our own living rooms through the science we thought could hold the world at bay. The video in question is quite scary, and needs to be viewed to have the full effect  it's got far more impact than the shaky camera work employed by The Blair Witch Project.\n",
            "In a horror movie you don't need acting generally (after all the characters are going to often bee too busy filling up body bags, to need acting). Fortunately though `Ring' scores itself fairly well in that department  Reiko is played out nicely as a determined single mother but also tempered with an obvious fear of not wanting to die. That is to say she has more dimensions than one. Similarly her estranged husband, Ryuji, has a nice mysterious flavour to him, seeing as he has some vested interest in the paranormal in a cloudy pastWhat gets `Ring' into your head is the smart script and directing (by Hideo Nakata). The movie is brisk  coming in at 96 minutes  and the count down on people's lives adds a delicious air of desperation and tension. This is heightened by the freaky appearances of the killer in momentary flits, and twisted dream sequences. The killer is chillingly silent, and made more foreboding by the ability to look innocent and menacing in alternate moments. Certain words, which have meaning in the movie, come to strike fear into the viewer's hearts in spite of the fact that they've often not yet been explained  we've been drawn into the movie universe, and are experience the character's terror at events.There are some flaws to `Ring', such as the character's somewhat too-readily acceptance of the nature of events surrounding them. However for the most part you're sucked in along with them, wondering what's going on (and, thankfully, finding out), while appreciate Nakata's ability to create a truly scary opponent (who doesn't need a hockey mask).

            "Review: 'I have to admit that I saw the American version first, and that I feel that it was far superior.I also need to point out that my review is mostly a rant of confusion inspired by my disappointment after reading the rave reviews (including those who recommended watching this film even though I saw the American version first, claiming this one is \"sooo much better\"). As a result MY REVIEW SPOILS JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRETY OF BOTH VERSIONS.With that said, I'm trying to be objective with my evaluation of the original. I do believe that had I not seen the American version first I would have liked this one better.So doing my best to put the American version out of my mind, where did the original fall flat ? For me the male character all of a sudden having psychic abilities half-way through the movie had me seriously considering turning the movie off. It was extremely poor script writing and pretty much killed the entire film for me. Then there were the visions seen by the female character that started around the same time.So I'm giving the movie 5/10 as my \"objective\" review. The psychic abilities made this movie a \"cheese fest\" for me. Still entertaining but really not scary, and actually rather lame. If I consider all of the changes that the American version made that worked for me I would give it a 1 or 2.What were those changes ? For starters, when the existence of the child is revealed, you know that there's something \"not quite right\" about her, but it's also suggested that she's a victim. The fact that she's kept in a barn with nothing but a TV makes you feel like she's being abused, and you sympathize with her. You don't know who to feel sorry for. Her mother, who's she's driving insane, or her. You wonder if maybe she can't help what she's doing to those around her, and is being treated unfairly. But you also ask yourself \"how would I deal with such a child?\" The insane asylum scenes worked beautifully for me. I read some of the other reviews and I can appreciate how some people preferred the silent ghost in the original. But when Samara was asked by the doctor \"You don't want to hurt people do you ?\" and she answers \"but I do and I'm SORRY\" that just sent chills down my spine. I think I enjoyed the thrill from that one line more than \"THE SCENE\" at the end (not to downplay that climactic scene, I just loved that one line from Samara so much).Which brings me to the \"well scene\". Some people in their reviews said they felt that Ringu had a better well scene. I disagree. For the sole reason that in the original they CHOSE to descend the well! (talk about killing the entire scene) In the remake Naomi Watts character was pushed into the well and she had no means of escape. That created an extremely helpless situation for her character that really scared the crap out of me. I could picture myself wetting my pants if I was trapped down there. It was very claustrophobic and terrifying, for the sole reason that the situation was involuntary. I was also disappointed that the Japanese version had the ghost's arm reach out from the water and grab the character. It felt very cliché. I was expecting that in the American version and was very relieved that they didn't do that (and very creeped out by what they did do!) Also, in the American version they didn't go to the cabin with the intention of digging for a dead body. They were searching for clues and happened to find the well, which succeeded in creating a much creepier atmosphere for me.I also felt that \"the video\" in the remake was way creepier. The fly, the mother diving off of the cliff, the finger nail breaking in the well, the ladder and, well THE RING! But I guess that's also a testament to the added story in the remake which created a much richer atmosphere and more compelling story that didn't need to use cheesy psychic abilities to explain everything away in a single scene or two and instead slowly reveal what was going on in a far more suspenseful and plausible manner (I know a ghost story isn't going for \"realism\" but I guess when everyone's got supernatural powers the evil bad guy just isn't as scary because it is no longer \"supernatural\" to have powers, it's \"natural\" in the universe of the story. So I felt like I was watching something like X-Men, not a horror movie). So really, I felt that the American version was far less cheesier, more plausible (with regards to the characters motivations), had a much richer story-line and because Samara was a complete enigma (i.e: she was adopted and her mother didn't have \"powers\") Samara was far more terrifying for me and became my all time favourite horror villain. I just didn't like the ghost in the original. In fact, there was nothing really to like or dislike. No sympathy for her or her parents. No asking myself how I would act if I were her parents. No feeling bad that she was murdered (in fact, the fact that it was pretty much conclusive that she had murdered someone else kind of justified her murder which was yet another disappointment). The original was simply psychic-power cliché cheese (she's got powers because her mother has powers only hers are slightly more ... \"powerful\"). Not an absolutely horrible movie when judged on it's own (without considering the awesome superiority of the remake), but extremely overrated none-the-less.'\n",

She think that the only option is to watch the tape to unsolve the mystery.This are the most important things that you should know. The whole movie is 'dark' what gives it a frightening atmosphere.

            "Review: 'First of all, \"Ringu\" falls into the same category as David Lynch's film \"Lost Highway\" in that it cannot be fully appreciated for it's terrifying elements without a proper setup.  Persay, a nice sized TV, surround sound, and watching the film alone in total darkness.SPOILERS AHEAD!!For example, the sequence where the top of the well is lifted off, you simply see it being lifted off.  However, in surround sound, as soon as it's lifted, a barrage of disconnected ghostly moans and groans permeate the soundscape, replete with subtle ambience and deep bass.  With a combination of dark lighting, carefully executed tracking shots that encircle the well ring as one the characters descends down into the well, and an increase in the amount of voices that come out of the well without breaking into the loud level, this makes for a truly frightening scene, one of unease and tension.Consider several other sequences that use subtle minimal sound and cinematography as it's technique.  The videotape itself has these strange little scratching sounds and whimpers, which are also heard over the phone, and when the videotape is first spotted by the lead protagonist, it shifts to a grainy extreme close-up of the videotape with Bernard Hermann'esque strings and a bizarre, distorted roar of some sort in the soundtrack.  The weirdly blurred photographs of the children after seeing the video, and the surveillance videotape of the children dead with the horrified look about their faces played in slow motion with a slurred growling sound in the soundtrack creates an unforgettably frightening image.  The sequence with the little girl slowly rising from the well in the final videotape, with a minimal amount of scratching sounds, and the way she clumsily walks toward the camera zombielike with her hair donned in front of her face before coming through the TV and only revealing in an extreme close-up a single eye glaring down at the victim may be only of the most simplistic yet most terrifying climaxes in film history.  The Japanese film horror approach is grandiose in it's vision, yet minimal in it's approach and delivery.  Much isn't used in this film, and it works to it's advantage.  There are no giant special effects, and it doesn't need them.\"Ringu\" is a rare horror film that is scary after repeated viewings as opposed to one-timers.  It works not simply because of the implications of the story about the videotape which will kill you in 7 days after watching it, but because through lighting, sound, cinematography and execution of the combined elements, there is an air of dread and fear so thick that it will shake even the most jaded horror fans to the very core of their being.  I will agree with most comments that \"Ringu\" is not a disturbing film, but it's a truly frightening film, one with genuine fear.  Most horror films depends on blood-and-guts gore and cheap shots to startle their audience rather than actually make them afraid of what they're seeing.  Most horror films will scare you as you watch the film, and you leave the theater completely relieved and are able to forget about it.  Some will say that this is because you're supposed to be relieved after seeing them, while in actuality, the horror film being seen is inferior because it only knows how to scare for a short period of time.  \"Ringu\" is a film that knows how to scare and leave truly frightening images imbedded in your mind.  It's the only horror film I have seen that has lasted with me for days on end, whereas most horror films are quickly dismissed and even forgotten.\n",
            "Sadly, most people will miss out on this due to a lack of a proper setup as I had mentioned above.  People say it doesn't matter, but sound design and picture quality is just as important an element in film as any.  And, most people are desensitized by Wes Craven shockers such as \"Scream\" or Kevin Williamson teen-horror flicks such as \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". By shocker, that doesn't mean that it contains images that will shock you to the very core of your being.  Rather, it means that it will make you jump or startle you, but never create an atmosphere that you feel uneasy about walking around in.  However, if you have an open mind and understand the dramatic process and can appreciate what is being done through sound and imagery, \"Ringu\" is an atmospheric horror film that will scare the hell out of you.'\n",

And I'd even say on face value & even on paper the American one should have been better. But the end results speaks for itself... The way this movie executed its premise & the way the director executed the overall compelling narrative from the beginning all the way to the end you feel the entire story unfold quite naturally and it flows excellently. How the director captivated the vision and executed it on screen makes the film have such a distinct feel to it that a lot of the late 90s horror movies didn't have. The movie somewhat takes a backseat and relies on the tension of mystery and thrilling elements so that when the horrifying moments come it's rather unexpected and they deliver when it's supposed to in areas that it should. It's not in your face horror it's more psychological & executed in an angle alot of horror movies rarely go in. The performances by the talented cast throughout definitely deliver on what the movie demands. Sucks the sequels could only dream of being anywhere close to this masterpiece. I will say without a doubt that this movie will and already has gone down in history as one of the most influential horror films of all time. I'm happy the Americans crafted their version so that it can be well known to audiences, hopefully down the future they can do a proper sequel or reboot so that we can really respect it. I remember they did it in 2017 and it was a complete failure. But fingers crossed. I would like more people to be more familiar with this but it stood it's place and definitely still has the impact in the genre that it should. And of course it's still well known overall. 9/10.'\n",

            "Review: 'For years I have heard great things about RING, both from Internet message boards, and from various publications.  Having long been familiar with RING's storyline and reputation for being relentlessly scary, I finally decided to seek it out.  Getting ahold of a copy was a challenge in itself, since it has not yet been officially released in the United States.  But eventually, I found a distributor in Britain who agreed to ship internationally.  Upon receiving my long-awaited DVD, I immediately tore off the shrinkwrap, popped it in the CD tray, turned off all the lights, and excitedly began watching.I was impressed.  I must say RING had me thoroughly creeped me out, and by the end, I was so chilled that I was unable to move.  The next time the telephone rang, I seriously hesitated before picking it up.  And every time I find an unlabeled videotape in my collection, I now think twice before popping it in the VCR.RING was not really what I expected at all.  Don't get me wrong, it WAS a really good film, and I DID anticipate that it would be scary.  It's just that I assumed it would be a different kind of \"scary\".  You see, RING really isn't out-and-out horrifying, but rather works at providing more of a subtle fright.  Instead of bombarding its viewer with constant cheap scares, chase scenes, or gory murders, RING spends its time drawing you into its unbearably eerie atmosphere, making you unwittingly become entangled in its mystery.  RING makes you become so engrossed, so involved, and so unable to sit still that the slightest movement or the tiniest sound (on or off screen) will startle you half to death.  You begin to develop a feeling of dread whenever a character is alone or in the dark, as if some malicious, unseen force is present in the darkness and waiting to strike when they are alone.  Then, before you can even realize what kind of stress your emotions are experiencing, the conclusion arrives, which is so jolting that it can only be described as the cinematic equivalent to a sucker-punch in the gut.If you're a fan of moody horror movies with an unbelievable amount of tension, then I highly recommend RING.  Fans of FRIDAY THE 13TH, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, or SCREAM probably won't see what all the fuss is all about.'\n",

            "Review: 'A ghost story with a chain-letter-ish videotape hook. Unless you just came from who knows where, you don't believe in bump-in-the-night ghosts. Weird video (ref. Videodrome) is for some reason, even if it's just that everyone hears patterns in static, more credible. The killer tape, which you can play solo from the DVD's extras, is scarier than the film that contains it. Within the tape, the shot of kanji and hiragana floating, waxing, waning, off what looks like a news page, immediately followed by blurry crawling men whose dark legs look like kanji fragments, is scarier than the b/w images of Sadako, because we haven't a clue how or why the type-characters are doing that.Kairo is a much scarier film, because, believe or not, god, God, or no god, in an age of multiple universe theories and time-traveling nano particles, a place where dead go is at least just barely conceivable. Kairo's wholesale, absolutely beyond mortal control, phenomenon trumps Ringu's maudlin, old fashioned, why-only-her, Sadako legend. If I recall, Kairo's manifestations begin as video, yet later have a static-like manifestation independent of any medium.Where the two films merge, and where the true horror of Ringu lies, is in Ringu's human chain, the social responsibility thrust onto each who views the tape, especially media rep Reiko and her ex. Reporting an aids or Ebola story isn't a lethal endeavor. Nor does reporting a war, a murder, whatever, have to be. Kairo isn't about running from a irreversibly waxing contagion. It's about reaching back again, again, and again to pull at first friends, then someone, then anyone along to the only maybe salvation offered by Koji Yakusho at the finish.Ringu's well made and acted, and never boring. Yet, even as old fashioned ghost stories go, the emanations of the child in Kurosawa's Seance are spookier than anything in the Ring series. And I don't think it's just that Nakata didn't have Koji Yakusho to react.'\n",

Under that circumstance, Ringu is an audacious attempt to take technology into a horror flick, using videotape as a storytelling tool, and probably thanks to that, it has become an instant classic.

The production is small but overall decently done, while several flaws are out there. Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) shouldn't have an ESP; the plot would be more thrilling and the audience might be more identified with him, if an ordinary person got involved and struggled.

It is only through thorough analysis that the strange messages appear. However, this only scratches the surface. Something sinister lies behind the tape; events in the past which have created this curse. Like the films, the TV series has some chilling moments, and boasts fine acting. Also, the cinematography is excellent (too often overlooked in American TV). I was first drawn to the series at a Japanese video store in my town. I am interested in Japanese horror films, and the owner recommended this. Even without English subtitles, I found the series captivating and, at times, even terrifying. It is really hard to go into details without giving away key plot points.

But one thing I was expecting was it to be better than the original considering Hollywood usually over exagerrates a lot of things with remakes and aren't used to subtlety.But Ringu really makes it worth your while because while it is the same story as the American remake, remember this is where it originally started from.I won't get into the plot as you probably all know what it is but I will talk about what makes this worth while viewing even if you've seen the original. Firstly, minimal use of visual effects actually adds more to the atmosphere - it feels a lot more authentic. Hideo Nakata uses sounds a lot more to deliver the atmosphere and scares and it works very well. There is a quite dread of discomfort surrounding the film that makes you feel that someone else is watching wherever you are. The look at Japanese culture and insights is also interesting.The video itself is shorter than the remake and actually feels more like a ghost sort of video since it looks less digital like than the US one did. The ending also leaves you with a sort of lesson you learn about the need to stay alive and what you will do regardless to stay so.I can't complain about either versions. They both pull off the story and concept very well and it really depends on what you're in the mood for. Hence I don't think you could say either versions is necessarily better as their styles are both unique and both create that sense of dread and atmosphere that can scare different audiences.'\n",

None of these movies are really gorefests and only a handful are jump-out-of-your-seat scary. Amongst them are Roger Corman's Pit and the Pendulum, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left, Shatter Dead, Jacob's Ladder, Se7en, Night of the Demon, Romero's Zombie Trilogy, most of Cronenberg's early work, Evil Dead and Halloween. Last night I added another to the list, in truth very high on the list. Ring is without a doubt one of the most frightening, unsettling and downright mind twisting movies I've ever seen. It is the first time in twenty years that I have gone to bed genuinely afraid (by the way I just turned 40 so I should know better).I was expecting some kind of Japanese version of the lame slasher movies that have infested our screens for the past too many years, but had heard enough about it to be sufficiently intrigued. Also being a fan of Japanese cinema I knew it would be quite different to the Screams and the Urban Legends. A good friend bought me a copy for my fortieth - which was nice (thanks Chris, now I can't sleep at all). Why does Ring work so well? Atmosphere... it is soaked in the stuff. The common factor that runs through my short list above is an overwhelming sense of doom that this just isn't going to end well. Ring is played completely straight and in a somewhat understated fashion. We believe these folks are ordinary people trapped in a nightmare (their worst nightmare). There is little of shock value and no blood. There is just an overwhelming sense of creepiness both visually and audibly - from the hyper-real everyday sound effects, to the portentous yet subdued score, the disturbing TV and flashback imagery to the stark relentlessly brooding photography.This movie is still playing in my head, which is entirely the point. I know it's a movie but even so I won't breathe easy until next Wednesday night when I'm still alive... if I'm still alive!'\n",

The other movies that could compare to this unique Japanese little horror flick (astonishing it was made for less than US$1.5 million) are the 1963 Robert Wise flick The Haunting, The Changeling (with George C. Scott), M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and Alejandro Amenábar's The Others.To be honest, I rented this movie on the whim that I should see the original before seeing an American re-make after debating the necessaries of re-making already good movies for the new audience with a video store clerk at an independent video shop specializing in obscure, foreign and hard-to-find DVDs and videotapes. I took home the movie knowing the basic premise of the plot, but nothing could prepare me for the tense suspense and atmosphere, not to mention one of the most horrifically convincing and authentic bone-chillingly creepiest scenes (near the ending, you will understand what I mean) in the history of film.Now I see why The Ring is a hugely successful movie in its native country and in Asia and Europe. It's a very good suspense-horror movie, and the twist is, the movie does not show the gratuitous shots of blood and gore. That's how wonderfully frightening this movie is, relying on the viewer's patience as the movie paces in suspenseful tension to the totally unexpected climax.If you're an ordinary movie viewer or a disaffected horror film fan who demands a good quality movie in the horror genre, The Ring is an ideal choice. In fact, I would recommend watching the movie with family or friend willing to be patient and stay alert late at night in the dark room illuminated by the television light. If you can bear to watch the slow-paced movie in English subtitles, trust me - it will scare the hell out of you and the family or friend out of consciousness. It did for me, considering the fact most horror movies I saw are so repetitive, tiresome, clichéd, bland and predictable they don't scare me at all. The Ring is an unforgettable experience of a ride that's actually better than The Sixth Sense in some aspect. Don't miss it.'\n",

I had heard about this movie being really different from common \"Hollywoodesque\" horror movies, so I was anxious to get it.One day I had the luck of running into it in a local dvd store. It came in a pack, along with another GREAT film, Battle Royale. I ran home as fast as I could.As soon as the movie ended, I just felt I had to watch it one more time (at least) so I could believe my eyes... I had just watched the greatest horror movie of all time.Why do I say this? Simple. Some say it's boring; some say nothing happens in the first 30 minutes. I say I was glued to the screen the whole time. This movie has a great atmosphere, it is intense and it just keeps getting more intense as the action proceeds.One of the main aspects I have to underline is that this film has a different sensibility in its direction. It may be low-budget, but it sure looks and feels like a million-dollar movie. The acting is awesome, the camera almost sucks you into the action, the plot is original and well conceived.To the ones who condemn this movie, I can only say one thing: either you're too used to americanized, cliched horror movies, or you tottaly lack sensibility. This movie is the reason I started \"believing\" in horror movies again. In my scale, 9/10.'\n",

I love horror and suspense in movies and i'm pretty much used to be scared the hell out of and took no further notice of the \"scariest movie ever even for the die hard horror fanatic\" lines. What can i say....i was stubborn. This movie holded a grip out of me and wouldn't let go. I couldn't sleep for hours scared of nightmares. It haunted my mind for days and days. Now i'm able to write about it.This movie is not to be compared with slasher movies like Halloween (for heaven's sake when are the sequels going to end?), Nightmare on Elmstreet, Scream etc. It's more of a mystical, psychological, mystery, horror movie. Kind of like The Sixth Sense or The Others for example. Only this is more scary and unpleasant in a good way. While you are watching the movie and seeing the leading actors finding out how to undo the curse you actually live up with them. And the suspense is building more and more with the minute (credit goes to the magnificent score) that even a ringing phone or a man standing in a room  makes your heart wants to abandon your precious body. But the final scene is truly the most sinisterly piece of art ever made for a horror movie. It has the timing to make the viewer nosy just to see what that moving \"thing\" is and as it comes closer the viewer tries to get away from the T.V but still is watching. Heartbeat is going faster and the score is building the tension up. Anxiety overcomes your state of mind and after watching the scene, it won't go away for days. I have seen tons of movies but not like this one. The Others comes close i have to say. This is truly a piece of cinematographic art and a recommendation for every horror/mystery/psychological movie fanatic.'\n",

I wanted this to be THE horror, the one that makes me shake uncontrollably when watching it and ends up affecting me for ages afterward. Sadly it wasn't, it just didn't scare me or put me on edge enough. The soundtrack was used rather nicely to build tension and suspense, but that tension and suspense kept ebbing away rather than continually building. There were very few big moments throughout, which isn't really a bad thing, but... For instance, at the climax where Sadako claims Ryuji, it was easily the scariest moment in the film, but I think it would've made more of an impact if we were given the chance to see Sadako or feel her presence more beforehand. It just seemed that for all the build up leading to it, more should have been done with it. The acting was competent throughout, but no-one really stood out. There were no prizes for acting here. I have one complaint though. At the end where Asakawa discovers what the cure is for the curse and is driving off to save her son, she seems to be remembering in her mind the voice of a girl who is basically telling us the cure and what Asakawa is doing. However, the voice seems to be from the same girl she was interviewing about the tape at the start of the film, so if that was the case, she would've already knew what to do to lift the curse and save Ryuji in the process! Minor quibble I guess, but the voiceover shouldn't have been there, we should have discovered that information another way. But anyway. \n",

            "Review: 'Minor, insignificant spoiler.As the US remake frenzy of Asian horror films got in the full swing at the start of the century, so developed the Western cult following of films such as Ring. NaÃ¯ve film watchers from the west were terrified enough by that fact that \"Ring\" was in a foreign language and from that oh-so-mysterious country of Japan, so the hype around the film grew out of proportion until most people had become so convinced it was some sort of life-changing horror fest that would turn their children into axe murderers and turn even the strong willed into alcoholics as they tried to recover from the ordeal they had just been put through.Not so surprisingly, the film is all hype. That isn't to say it's a bad film; it's well executed and slightly creepy in places, but the pinnacle of Japanese cinema, even recent Japanese cinema, it is not. It's no more scary than your average American horror film; but superior in that the plot hasn't been dumbed down for three year olds like Hollywood has a habit of doing.Something I've noticed is that Japanese horror directors since the 80s have had the good taste to take heavy inspiration from David Cronenberg. Watching Ring, any Videodrome fans might have a slight sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu as the basic plot is laid down; a TV transmission corrupts whoever watches it. Thankfully, these Japanese teenagers aren't subjected to what James Woods had to endure. This is another example of just how commercial Ring is, contrary to what the hype will have you believe. The unlucky ones who watch the video merely die with a surprised look on their faces.The film has its good points however; the story is handled well, there are engaging performances from Nanako Matsushima and Hiroyuki Sanada, who, if \"The Twilight Samurai\" is anything to go by, is one of the best actors in Japan at the moment. The best bit, is of course the ending, which everyone in the west is probably is familiar with because of the remake. That obligatory twist and the ending which sets up a sequel is obviously commonplace in horror films, but the story has been handled so well up to that point that you actually care what happens to the characters, which is not commonplace for horror films.This all said, Ring is far from being a bad film, just another example of how a film can be severely damaged by hype. Watch it as a superior thriller, rather than a horror film, but don't expect anything life changing.PS, probably the most hysterical aspect of this film is the American trailer, with the wonderful pronunciation \"RINGÂ….OOOOO\".'\n",

Like many remakes for American audiences, `The Ring' feels the necessity to explain far too much.  There are masses of talk in that movie where the characters in `Ringu' are surrounded by stillness and thought.  The quality of silence around the child in this movie reminds me the muteness of the child actor in `The Sixth Sense'.The American version is sentimental-although not as sentimental as I feared it would be.  For instance, we do not have the divorced couple falling into each other's arms at realization of their common fear.  However, this version does attempt to come up with a psychological explanation of the impending horror that `Ringu' does not need.  Ringu's terror is a force as explicable and relentless as nature.The American movie shows the American couple desperately trying to solve their problem, to fight their way out of a box, to change nature.  The Japanese couple also wants to avoid their common fate, but I am not left with people seeking to change nature.  I am left with the image of people seeking to live within the natural world as it exists even as it seeks to destroy them.'\n",

            "Review: 'Nifty, effective supernatural thriller that was a huge box-office hit in Japan and became a much-praised but little-seen cult movie everywhere else. Based on a successful novel by writer Roji Suzuki, it can be seen as the oriental version of Kevin Williamson's post-modern horror thrillers, only without the irony; the film even starts with the by-now compulsory prologue where two teenagers scare each other with an urban legend, this time about the \"curse video\" - anyone who sees this strange tape gets a phone call immediately afterwards, prophesying death in a week's time. The urban legend, though, turns out to be true, as an intrigued TV reporter finds out when she researches the subject and grabs hold of the tape, leaving her with only seven days to solve its deadly mystery. Unlike most of the American genre entries, director Hideo Nakada builds this one from the mood up; its eerie atmosphere, cleverly created among perfectly normal and banal surroundings, is central to amplifying and solving the puzzle at the film's heart and the director steadfastly avoids the usual shock tactics of Western genre filmmaking, going instead for a disquieting, elegant ambiance where anything can happen. However, I must say that, as clever as it is, this is not as scary as its growing reputation would have it, although with a superb premise, a sly media critique (all bad things come from or happen on TV) and a few truly inspired moments (especially in the last half hour), it's a very intriguing and enjoyable thriller.'\n",

The American remake has that one creepy scene and is more entertaining throughout, this one takes itself pretty seriously and has an elevated atmosphere. Both tales I find don't really come together organically though, the mystery is built up but the way it's solved is through spoon feeding dialogue and flashbacks. One reason I like Ju-On so much is how literal it is and how much more effective and straightforward the scares are. Same with Dark Water which has essentially the same mystery but a better plot development. It also tried to be a little too emotional for what the film was actually able to achieve, there were parts that obviously were supposed to be sad but they feel weak because of the film's presentation and writing. Again, Dark Water does this better. I'm making Ring out to seem worse than it is, it's still a fun film to binge in preparation for Halloween, it's just not an instant go to for me.'\n",

I do try not to become too specific, but just to be safe...Unlike most American films, the fear inspired by this piece has little to do with gore, blood or violence. And the very structure of the film is distinctly (and, not to sound too biased, but in this case, gloriously) un-American. The entire plot style of an American film is to build up in a series of little jolts, to prepare the viewer for a grande finale, some sort of climax that will finally wind down and by the end of the film, all the loose ends are (psychologically speaking, anyway) tied up, rounded off, and smooth - leaving the viewer with memories of frightening imagery, but with everything resolved and taken care of. (In the case that it isn't, there's usually a sequel involved.) Such is the case with the American remake - most things get cleaned up. The Japanese film, though - in my case, I went into it not knowing a thing about the film. I'd never seen any Japanese horror films, or that many Japanese films at all, for that matter - at the tender age of thirteen I had no clue what I was getting into. I was glad to find it wasn't your standard gore fest, but a bit disappointed when it seemed to me to be a simple ghost story - I was hoping for something frightening. And, lo and behold, after my defences were down, after I was relaxed and resigned to the concept that it wasn't going to frighten me... Well, the middle-aged guy sitting in front of me screamed out loud.Personally I found that this was the perfect structure for a horror film. With such atmosphere and visual effect at the zenith, and so little to prepare one for it, it's far more potent than any other moment of any other horror film I've watched to date.

            "Review: 'One of the things I appreciated the most about this movie is the complete and utter lack of gore. There's not a drop of blood to be found in this film, which makes the sight of so many dead bodies, their faces frozen in hideous screams of horror, all the more effective. The character of Sadako also has more of an impact than the child from the remake. Sadako never speaks, her face is never seen (but for one hideous, floating eye) and her presence is solid, unlike her static-y American sister. Sadako's emergence from the TV screen in the films final moments is worth waiting through the rest of the movie to see; it is a truly creepy moment which looks to have been filmed backwards as Sadako creeps with jerky, inhuman movements across the floor and up, swiveling to face her victim. That scene haunted me (no pun intended) for two full nights of broken sleep...mostly because Sadako seemed so terribly human, as sad as she was frightening. You pity her before you see her merciless side, and this throws the balance way out of whack.\n",
            "The Japanese location may make the story more remote, but also makes it more mysterious. The story would work in another locale, say, the Deep South, US, but there's just something about \"Ring\" which works due to its defiance to comply with cliche. Just when you think you've got the film nailed down and swaggeringly predict the next events, you're proven totally wrong and dealt the double joy and horror of a perfectly timed shock revelation or two.The film is made in typical Japanese horror genre style that plays on the mind as well as including sudden shock effects. Fans of urban legend type horror will take delight in this offering from director Nakata Hideo and whilst the film does lack substance somewhat, it makes up in suspense and mystery. You are also made to sit on the edge of your seat by the film's soundtrack which is disturbingly quiet, subtle and sinister. The atmosphere is the key part of the film that makes it a horror masterpiece. The story is cleverly written to move at a rate which keeps the audience interested and finally end in a twist that sets itself up for a sequel.But there's something else that frightens apart from the film's construction. Is it the ultimate realization that this thing will not be placated no matter the heroic and well-intentioned efforts of the film's principal leads? Yes, that's an acutely chilling slant to be sure. But ultimately, I feel that the most disturbing element is that, were we to find ourselves in this position, we would be faced with a terrible choice - face the horror ourselves or deliberately inflict it on another. Escape it and you condemn your own soul.'\n",

It deserves a ten, it is also very well filmed after the novel. But I have a question, ring 2 isn't available in the Netherlands, is it? the Japanese one I mean. And I'd like to know where exactly because I would like to see it. I've also seen the prequel: ring o birthday. Which was also very good. Because they stayed with the original movie and yet gave it a little twist, like that there was a second Sadako. Who was the mean one. Anyway, I'm a big fan. I think I'm gonna buy or rent all of the ring movies, including the American ones. Here's how I bought ring: I heard about it through my friends and they advised me to watch it. I saw the American one first and me and my dad thought it wasn't all that. It contained too much Hollywood-style. Anyway, I went to the place were the rented videos and DVD's, and my friend came along. they had both the DVD and the video, for sale! only one euro. (not that I wouldn't buy it for more). I watched it and afterward I knew why they had a warning at the beginning. And I must say, having it on video is very traditional according to the movie.. greets Fabienne.'\n",

I have also seen Dark Water and The Eye which I enjoyed but did't find overly scary. I think this may be due to the fact that many films use a single image to create the shock. The slightly strange embracing of dead bodies which comes with a lot of Japanese films for example. I must admit I found The Blair witch project more scary.

            "Review: 'Sam 3's comments below concerning \"Noroi\" and \"On-nen\" are fascinating, and, though I am certainly no expert on Japanese traditions of horror and ghost stories, I think his thoughts on the subject really touch on the power of this film. At the heart of RINGU is an overwhelming emotional presence of not only fear and dread, but also bitterness, hatred and humiliation. To me, the best horror films have a strong sense of meanness to them, as if the ghosts, undead, evil presence, etc. has a bone to pick and will pick that bone in the most uncompromisingly dreadful manner imaginable. In a film like RINGU, no quarter is spared in causing great suffering and terror on a victim, and we the audience must feel that terror and suffering in a manner of near osmosis.This film reminded me of other films which had similar elements. The creepy video reminded me of the creepy pirate broadcasts in David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME. Also, the opening scene in RINGU is somewhat reminiscent of the powerful opening \"Telephone\" segment in Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (later homaged in SCREAM) -- though far more mysterious. And then there is the powerful theme of a (seemingly) innocent who seeks to cause great harm and terror -- a theme present in many of the greatest modern horror films such as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE BROOD, THE CHANGELING, etc.All of these elements are combined successfully, not through a great story, but through the great talent of the director. In fact, the film's weakness is its highly contrived, overly complicated and occasionally silly plotting, which often drags and other times simply leaves you scratching your head. It's simply not that well-written. But it is written well enough for a talented director to create a highly forceful film with a visual quality disturbs in its uncomfortably suspenseful transitions and its genuinely disturbing visuals. This director has an extraordinary feel for simple visuals that are authentically creepy. Much of the power in this film is, like in much of the best horror films and books, in its use of familiarity -- its use of everyday things. This movie makes watching TV and answering the phone scary. It makes reflections frightful. It scares us by intimating that the everyday has the potential to be something completely unknown and threatening. It implies that representations of horror and terror can creep into reality. The two dimensional recording becomes three dimensional and alive -- in all its meanest, most spiteful and evil manner.Then there is an ending that is among the most memorable of any horror film ever made. Well-done. It made this jaded dude cringe in fear. The effect takes hold more after the film is over than when the film is playing, but I'll say that when it's playing it scares delightfully. Watch this film alone at night at your own risk, but please do not show this film to kids. It's too scary for children. They'll be up at night for weeks, if not months...'\n",

            "Review: 'Have you ever wondered what would happen if you crossed The Mummy's Ghost with Poltergeist? Neither have I. But I am not KÃ´ji Suzuki, writer of the novel that the movie Ringu is based on. Now, I must admit, I've never actually read the book, however I am aware that it is amazingly popular in both its native Japan and around the world. So presumably Hiroshi Takahashi had a lot to live up to when he produced the screenplay. Luckily I am neither a massive animÃ© fan nor prepared to go and read the graphic novel to compare the two. Besides, would it really help with my review of the movie? Almost certainly not.Opening with a classic horror movie conceit, the 'camp fire' story, Ringu is a post-modern telling of a classic story; the vengeful ghost seeking revenge on the living.Investigating the death of her niece, news reporter Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) stumbles onto the urban legend of a video tape that is rumoured to be cursed. Anyone who watches it will die seven days later. After much investigation she manages to track down the tape and so naturally she watches it.Thanks to this rather obvious faux pas, Reiko spends the rest of the movie trying to lift the curse. In doing so she shows her psychic ex-husband Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) the film as well. Her poor, innocent son also watches the video, although, to be fair, she didn't actually give it to him, she just left it around so that he could watch it when she wasn't looking.Now, I may be coming across a trifle harsh. However I would like to stress that I did enjoy this movie greatly. While I may not think the story itself is fantastic (though a few elements are wonderful) as with any ghost story, that isn't important. What is important is the telling, and judging by this movie Nakata must have had all the other Cub Scouts soiling themselves by the fire.What this movie has in bucket-loads is style. Nakatas use of camera angles is both compelling and awkward, and the sudden appearance of characters into frame leaves the watcher unsure of what may happen next. When you watch you see great scene after great scene. Some stand-out moments include: a skull seeming to cry ooze; Sadako climbing out of the well on the television, approaching the screen and stepping into the physical world, (probably the best scene in the movie); and of course the cursed video itself, a mis-mash of images and sounds that Dali would be proud of.I watched this movie with a group of seven or eight other people, most of whom had seen it before. I noticed two things. Firstly my friends are eminently predictable (the house phone rang just after the first time the cursed video played). Still, it was amusing. Second, and far more interesting, was noticing their reaction to certain scenes. At one point, during a flashback./vision, we see Sadako kill a reporter simply with the power of her mind. I fond his death quite horrific as he collapsed in agonising pain, however quite a few people watching the movie laughed at that point. I don't know if this reflects on the way I watch movies or the way they do. However, as I hadn't really watched this movie before I did find myself regretting watching it with others, as I think I would have been able to immerse myself in the movie more, which is something you have to do with a psychological horror if you are going to truly enjoy it as the director wanted.The importance of this movie to Western audiences cannot be overstated. This helped open the doors to Japanese horror movies. (Or, as those of us in the know like to call them, J-Horror). It has also been remade at least twice, by Korea and America, with the American adaptation made by Nakata himself.If you haven't yet seen this movie then I do advise you to watch it alone. It is scary, but it is an intellectual fear and so one we need to truly process, which is much harder to do with someone munching popcorn next to you. Go ahead; let yourself be drawn in and given a fright.'\n",

            "Review: 'I have read numerous opinions concerning the subject of Ringu versus the U.S. remake. Since I have not yet seen the Hollywood interpretation of Ringu I won't comment on it, yet I find it hard to believe that it could be more terrifying than this. I've also noticed that people seem to either love or hate this movie, much like The Blair Witch Project, which some people seemed to loathe for whatever reason. As for myself, I have grown to love both Ringu and the first Blair Witch Project. My theory is as follows; how much you enjoy/dislike these kind of movies all have to do with how much you embrace the atmosphere of the movie, how much you try to picture yourself in the characters situation, sort of speaking. In the Blair Witch case, for example, I think we would all be scared half to death if we were in the situation that was portrayed in that movie. Unless, of course, you have a steady supply of valium and horse tranquilisers. If you can't picture yourself in the protagonist(s) situation, of course you're going to think that the movie is boring. Sorry for the rant, but the conclusion is: same goes for Ringu. I might have a slightly unorthodox take on this, but for me, a good eerie atmosphere that you can picture yourself in is absolutely paramount in any horror flick. Without that, you have nothing as far as I'm concerned. These kind of horror movies are supposed to get your imagination going, and sad to say many people don't seem to have much of an imagination to move in the first place.Ringu was one of those movies I sat down and watched without having heard anything about it beforehand, except that it was some sort of a Japanese horror flick. I began to watch it with little hope of this being a good movie, but when it was over I was left sitting on the sofa with my fist stuck between my teeth in an attempt to cope with my `post-horror stress disorder'. I also think I might have swallowed large portions of the pillow I used to shield my tender eyes with during the more terrorizing portions of the movie, as well as choking on the popcorn. The director Hideo Nakata (kudos to him, by the way) has really achieved a perfect atmosphere of psychological horror-suspense here, not so much relying on `BOOH!'-effects (though there are a few of those around, for sure) but rather constructing a more and more unpleasant and ghastly mood as the movie progresses, and this is all done in a highly impressive and skillful way with thankfully little use of special effects. In the beginning of the movie I thought that this was probably some sort of dull Japanese take on Scream with dumbfounded teenagers running around getting butchered, and even though some vague parallels with Scream might exist, it was something I quickly forgave Ringu for. I will certainly not post any spoilers, but after an hour or so into the movie you really start to feel the uneasy mood start to creep up on you, and I have to say that the subtitles didn't bother me at all. Good acting, a superb score, a terrifying story and excellent directing are all combined in Ringu. Needless to say, I highly recommend this movie. watch it on a rainy night with the lights turned down and let the atmosphere embrace you.In my personal opinion, this is one of the very best horror movies of the 90's together with The Blair Witch Project. Ring(u) really re-established my faith in this genre which has recently been plagued by far too many crappy additions. Next to the old master Dario Argento, I dare to say that Hideo Nakata is one of my favourite horror directors of all time.'\n",

            "Review: 'This Japanese horror film is hugely popular in its homeland, spawning a sequel, TV series and even a line of toys. It has also been causing quite a stir in the West, being heralded as the sign of a revolution in the genre, returning to a more calculating horror rather than the cheap shock tactics of slasher flicks.The story begins with Reiko, a reporter investigating the mysterious deaths of several high school students, including her niece, and the urban myth that is spreading through the country concerning a cursed videotape. The rumour goes that if you see this tape you have only one week left to live and after tracking down a copy and watching it, Reiko becomes convinced that she too has given herself a death sentence.In this way the story is not too far removed from the 50's horror classic 'Night of the Demon', with an initially sceptical investigator becoming increasingly more fearful of their fate and racing to try and lift the curse. It also is not wholly unlike the slasher films which have reduced the genre to self-parody in that it has it's origins firmly in the whispers of school halls and spectre of urban legends. What does mark it our however is the ancient folklore underlying the modern myth which makes it more 'Candyman' than 'Scream'.The beginning is very promising and really draws you in to the mystery surrounding the dead teenagers. However the story then begins to lose its way a little through the middle section as it turns out Reiko's ex-husband is conveniently psychic and they run from place to place trying to solve the puzzle of the videotape. The tape itself is genuinely unnerving, with grainy footage of writhing shapes accompanied by some unpleasant sound effects, but like the rest of the film never resorts to gore or shocks, instead content to establish, and for the most part maintain, an overriding sense of creepiness.Then, just as the whole thing seems to be getting a little silly with tales of unnatural powers and the fury of the dead, just as it looks like everything is okay and everyone is going home to bed for a quiet drink of milk and some biscuits, you realise that there is still five minutes of the film left. And what follows is one of the most delightfully understated twist endings I have seen, which really does feel like someone has taken their filth encrusted fingernails and dragged them screeching down your spinal cord. In the face of this simple but effective exercise in fear the ridiculousness of the rest is forgotten and like the best films of it's kind, 'Ring' doesn't go away when you turn off the TV. In fact, you'll want to throw your telly out of the window just to be on the safe side.'\n",

The acting in Ringu is sub-par and the story tends to drift rather than keeping the viewer engaged. The language/subtitles probably hinders the impact of the story for English only speakers, so I will cut some slack there.None the less, it truly is a phenomenal story- both versions, but \"The Ring\" is my easy choice.'\n",

Especially the subtitled version because it keeps the original dialogue in place etc. Worth watching! 6/10'\n",

            "Review: 'Hideo Nakata's masterpiece. Avoid the god-awful American remake, this is brilliant. Quite what was going through Nakata's mind when he made Ringu 2, though, is anyone's guess! Part road movie, part journalistic drama, all horror. Although it departs somewhat from the novel, in many ways it improves on it. Changing and merging several of the central characters works better than it had any right to. The sense of doom and urgency is unrelenting. The use of sound is ground-breaking. I have watched this more than 5 times now, and it never pales. All the actors are on the money, the camera work is good, the effects effective (sorry!), the pace just right. It's all good and set a new standard, not just for \"Asian\" movies but for all horror movies. It is to Hollywood's lasting shame that their response to this challenge was to remake, badly, instead of upping their own game.'\n",

            "Review: 'I finally got around to seeing this movie last night (Halloween!) and found it enjoyable, but a little disappointing after all that I had heard about it. However I woke up this morning thinking about the plot and feeling genuinely uneasy about the open cupboard door in my bedroom so it definitely did its job to some extent.After checking in here and reading so many reviewers' comparison of this film to 'Videodrome' I'd also like to point out its similarities to a classic old b/w horror called 'Night Of The Demon' (1957). That film features a paper inscribed with runes which will a short time later lead to the horrible death of anyone who finds it in their possession.Similar, then, to the videotape conceit of 'Ringu'; however, the protagonist in 'Night Of The Demon' is highly sceptical of the supernatural and the film follows his gradual conversion as he realises the true horror of the fate that approaches him. Personally I found this idea more interesting and more realistic than the bland acceptance of the supernatural exhibited by the characters in 'Ringu'.So if you enjoyed 'Ringu', check out 'Night Of The Demon', a creaky horror classic! (But steer clear of the US edit re-titled 'Curse Of The Demon', which removed much of the vital exposition.)'\n",

I feel like its iconic status in the J-Horror trend of the late 90s/early 00s sets unrealistic expectations. The understated acting and the absence of a stylistic aesthetic make the supernatural moments more potent and the slow burn all the more worthwhile.I recommend that you watch with an open mind, understanding that there are cultural, social, and creative aspects and approaches that differ from our own (wherever you may live).It's a film that asks viewers to let the story unfold, to let the supernatural creep in, to let the dread engulf them.(Available for free on Kanopy)'\n",

            "Review: '\"Ringu\" came out back in 1998 and caused quite a stir. It's really the film that kicked off the run of Asian horror movies that have since garnered a massive following and become the inspiration for umpteen American remakes. I think I'm one of the fortunate ones that picked up on the sensation early enough and saw \"Ringu\" long before the remake was released. Those who watch them in reverse order may be a little disappointed as they simply lose out on the effect that this unique (at the time) experience held. I'm not suggesting that \"Ringu\" isn't worth viewing. It just has flaws that the creators of the remake were generally able to rectify and having the knowledge of what happens at the end definitely takes away from the result.The plot involves a videotape containing bizarre and creepy imagery. When someone watches the tape, they immediately receive a phone call and the countdown begins. They will die in seven days! The reasons for this are completely unclear for the majority of the film, but the main characters (who are attempting to save their own lives after watching the tape) slowly unravel the mystery to discover who is behind the curse and why. When I first heard this plot I thought it was stupid. Describing it to friends that haven't seen it still gets the same response. Yet \"Ringu\" is convincing enough to really get under your skin. The tape really is creepy for starters! It's far shorter than in the remake, yet the combination of grating sounds and atmospheric visuals that you just can't quite figure out works really well. The music in the film is minimal to say the least and it really only kicks in when something scary or important occurs. It's certainly not utilized for shock value like in so many American movies these days which is a breath of fresh air. Without a doubt though, it's the shocking finale that the viewer will never forget. I nearly soiled myself on first viewing and I consider myself to be a fairly difficult person to scare.As for which version is better, well in most cases I find remakes fairly pointless exercises and nearly always disappointing. Yet \"The Ring\" is in my opinion far superior to \"Ringu\" for the following reasons. The acting is much better, the story doesn't rely on one of the main characters being able to read minds to unravel, and there's a whole heap of new background information on the characters involved. But even with all these flaws, I still really enjoy \"Ringu\" and suggest fans of the remake check it out to see where the whole thing started. If you haven't seen either, I highly recommend watching the Japanese version first for full appreciation.'\n",

An old concept, which felt kinda saturated, is reborn and made very fit to the time when this was conceived. I mean, it's funny to imagine such type of horror in 2022. Cassette tapes and house telephones, things that have been surpassed already (in the modern world, of course).This witch wouldn't be very effective nowadays, and actually, she would move to the internet and come out from a cursed website, and that sounds much more lame. Cassette tapes, static TV sounds and a telephone ringing with a cursed message are really scary things, so this worked greatly at its time.Adding more about the witch concept. I like it, and I really enjoyed the mysterious story of Sadako and her family, Ryuji's conjectures about it, and the great final scene.I should add, that this is more like a thriller than anything. There's the horror thing, but I found it to be more of a light one, so expect a good story, a good mystery and great tension moments, not much brutality.'\n",

If you intent to underestimate what the movie will provide, then you will end up denying that you are actually are afraid or enjoyed the horror from the movie.Although the film was made for the movies, its indented theme is best on video or DVD, or should correct myself - the TV screen.When a relative died mysteriously, Reiko, a journalist was reporting a case of 4 similar high school deaths. The friends at school were giving hints about their vacation a week before their death, and a strange video & a phone call that would mark the curse. At the relative's funeral, Reiko found a receipt from a Photo print shop, and realises one of the prints had some unexplained smudging. Her investigation has lead her to the retreat where the victims spend, and place herself into the '7 days to live' curse. In the pursuit for answers and for her own sake, Reiko gets help for the investigation, a boyfriend who happens to be a video editing technician.I won't go any further, but you will see ghost, ghost and more screen reflections. Perhaps the most frightening part of the movie is that  the curse is still out there, so watch the sequel - in your bedroom's TV screen. Hint: just look out for the reflections & make sure your phone (& portable ones) is working. I spent almost 2 weeks without a goodnight sleep, definitely not for the young.'\n",

So of course I bid a ridiculously high offer and won the auction, and about two weeks letter I had a copy in my eager little hands.Well let me tell you, I was disappointed.Probably just a case of too much hype, and also probably because the English subtitles were so badly translated every character spoke like Jar Jar Binks. But I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about, and on top of that I had trouble following the story (again probably the fault of the subtitles).The plot is basically about a pretty reporter named Reiko on the trail of an urban legend about a cursed videotape that kills its viewers exactly seven days after they watch it.  She is drawn into the investigation by the death of her cousin, who apparently watched the video and paid the price.  Reiko doesn't believe in the curse until she finds the videotape and watches it herself, and realizes she has seven days to figure out how to break the curse or die.The film does have its moments, and it builds suspense fairly well for a while, but eventually you realize nothing much is happening.  The initial scariness of recognizing that Reiko may very well be sealing her own doom eventually evaporates.  The last two thirds of the film is a rather slow-moving detective story as she tries to track down the origins of the tape and figure out how to keep from dying.  But there is at least a shocking ending that makes the wait worthwhile.All in all it's still worth seeking out a copy if you can find it (but don't make my mistake and pay too much for it!)'\n",

            "Review: 'I am one of those people who wished they had seen the original version before seeing the remake. I made this mistake twice now. Not anymore. Last year, around the same time, I started watching Japanese horror movies. I watched The Grudge trilogy (2004, 2006 & 2009) before watching the 2000 movies, Ju-On: The Curse and its sequel; which I both had mistaken for the movies that was remade as The Grudge, despite the fact that certain elements were taken from The Curse; such as the jaw scene. However, luckily enough, I have a chance to make this right when I plan on watching Dark Water soon. I also watched Kairo (2001) before watching its American remake: Pulse (2006), and I'm glad I did. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge you to do so.Ringu is a quite minimalistic horror movie as a whole, which is definitely not a bad thing. In fact, it's even better. Overall, I prefer The Ring over Ringu, but there are certain elements that Ringu has that its American remake, The Ring, doesn't have. Ringu doesn't rely on jump scares as much as The Ring does. Like most Japanese horror movies that came after Ringu, it relies on its atmosphere. While the feeling of dread is surely not missed in The Ring, the combination with its cheap scare tactics is what ultimately weakens the atmosphere in comparison.As a result of watching The Ring before Ringu, I was quite underwhelmed by the last scene of the movie. I did not feel frightened by the scene because I knew what was coming. If I hadn't seen the remake first, and thus hadn't known what would happen, this movie surely would've scared the living hell out of me. In the end, The Ring blew Ringu right out of the water. But for reasons very obvious: a bigger budget and improved technology, it is clearly the superior movie. A 6/10 for Ringu, and an 8/10 for The Ring.'\n",

The characters in the movie, with great acting and dialog, are very deep and you can tell how they will act and react as if you actually knew them. This gives a sense of familiarity, and you will be comfortable with it. But I highly doubt you will be comfortable, because this movie is probably one of the scariest you will ever see. The tension between Reiko Asakawa and Ryuji Takayama can be eerie at times because of their current relationship and history with each other. Aside from dealing with the threat they are faced with, they must also deal with each other and their anger with one another.This movie also discards the scientific approach to Sadako Yamamura's curse, by focusing on the supernatural aspect of it. This is probably the reason why people tend to like this movie better than \"Rasen\" (Spiral). Since the story is modified so much, do not expect an adaptation of the novel... expect a re-interpretation of it. If you want to watch an adaptation of the story, watch the television version... but have fun finding it! Because of Hideo Nakata's wonderful directing, Koji Suzuki's stories finally got the attention they deserved. People have become so familiar with the story, it's astounding. There is also many knock-offs of Sadako (Grudge/Ju-On, anyone?); saying it has become a worldwide icon would not be an overstatement. And even if you know the ending of this movie, it will scare the hell out of you. If you knew the budget of this movie, you'd be even more scared.Asakawa is in the midst of a new urban legend - a tape that murders in a week's passing - and must get the scoop on it after her niece and her friends die (at the exact same time too, I might add).Her investigation leads her to a rental cabin they had stayed at, but ends up getting more than she bargained for when she actually discovers the tape and innocently watches it. She knows that something specific must be performed before the deadline is up, and so enlists her ex-husband, Takayama, to help her solve the riddle.There investigating reveals that a long-dead woman is featured on the tape, brushing her hair. Shizuko was a psychic that was branded a fraud and drove herself to suicide. They find out her living location, and after more investigation, discover a secret that was meant to be buried. Shizuko had a daughter, Sadako, and she had mysteriously disappeared thirty years ago.Asakawa and Ryuji then discover that the tape was created by Sadako herself, who was thrown in a well left to die thirty years ago. They think that the only way to save themselves is to find Sadako's corpse and to release her vengeful spirit, in a race against time.*****/*****'\n",

However the story is hard to keep up with and can be confusing especially in such scenes as the one on the beach with the owner of the hotel, who is related to Shizuko, and Ryuji starts to shout at him. The death of the first girl was not shown particularly well as her positioning was not well placed because she was standing in front of the fridge which does not make the space behind her very threatening and so when she turns around and we see the look on her face it is hard to feel scared at that point because we cannot imagine it because there is no space for the murderer to come up from behind so our imagination is restricted. Although it has some scary parts, the scariest easily being Sadako coming out of the TV, it could have been better with its telling of the story and its acting.'\n",

            "Review: 'When watching this movie, I had the unfortunate plight of seeing the remake before the original. I tried to not let this influence my viewing of this one, but it was impossible. Despite being the shorter film, \"Ringu\" goes past slow-burn territory and just goes into \"lagging\" territory. This was my first J-Horror movie (so I am probably not as used to the style), but I found it hard to get into it. The characters are moderately developed, but not enough to be fully invested in them. Plus, the son (who the mom is trying to protect) is barely in the movie at all. The whole motivation of the mother is to protect this child, yet we hardly see him, except two or three times. Another problem I had was the plot progression. Rather than having twists and turns along the way, there is one or two pieces of information, given about the tape in the first hour. I will admit that the cut-scene which reveals Sadako's powers was very interesting, as well as the scenes where Ryuji finds out about her past through his psychic powers (a sub-plot that was not in the remake). However, once the plot starts revealing itself, there is very little of the movie left; I wish it had the same aura of mystery throughout. It feels like there are just scenes of people talking and than they remembered that they were supposed to reveal who Sadako was and what her purpose was. The tape itself is also lacking in the creepy imagery; there are only three or four scenes on it and the film almost never reveals what they mean, except with the mirror, the man with the bag over his head (on second thought, it doesn't even mention his purpose) and of course, the ring itself. What I did like however, was (I'm not sure if I missed this in the remake) that when Asawaka looked upwards towards the well and discovered that this was the ring shape in the video. It also did a better job in explaining that the copy of the tape was the reason that she didn't die and the reason Ryuji did. My favorite part of the film was the music; I thought that was the creepiest part of the movie and blew the remake's out of the water. I just wish there were scary parts in the movie, which accompanied those scenes. An exception was the infamous television scene, which was executed very well, although (as I was reminded in other comments), the black and white flash just felt weird and not as terrifying. I know that I am new to the culture and I did watch the remake first, so this could have made me enjoy this one less. However, I still think that I would have had problems with the pacing, but I won't know for sure. I would advise people to watch this one first (since it is the original) and see if that makes you enjoy it more as a standalone movie. Unfortunately, I was not able to.'\n",

Made via forces of the supernatural activities it shows some definite awareness of the Soviet montage school inheritance. The effect brought on by the juxtaposition of the truly bizarre ingredients is not the communist propaganda, but the stunning hypnotism of the Unknown. Apart from Eisenstein (who also used to admit his obsession with the Unknown in his writings), the principle allusion that rises here is Kenneth Anger. His \"Invocation of My Demon Brother\" and especially \"Lucifer Rising\" use montage technique just in the same (and masterful) way - as a powerful generator of that enchanting sensation of the Hardly Explicable, the Inexplicable and the Better-Be-Inexplicable. Let's cherish hope that Sadako's little masterpiece will give birth to the whole brave new wave of the Montage Cinema From Beyond (which other roots will include Bunuel's \"Chien d'Andalou\", Jodorowsky's exercises and the films they showed poor Alex in \"Clockwork Orange\")'\n",

Western horror movies have all been dry-ed up and Hollywood is desperately remaking any Asian horror that has a 5 plus rating on IMDb. Because there people are still making good horror and of course Hollywood has to cash in on that. One such movie that will probably be remade in the next two years is \"Shutter\". Coming straight from Thailand this is not just good, it's fantastic, probably the most terrifying ride I had since I saw \"In The Mouth Of Madness\" a few years back. Grabs you by the hand from the first minute and never let's go until the end. The way horror is supposed to be.\"Shutter\" follows a pretty standard formula in terms of plot. A photographer is haunted by the ghost of a woman and as the story unfolds we understand the reason why. Not the most original work, but it's solid in terms of writing and dialogue. The final conclusion is a very ironic yet satisfying experience, in touch with the atmosphere and tension build up to this point. Characters are likable enough so it get's very nerve-wrecking when they find themselves in danger. In fact it's safe to say that the entire movie is nerve-wrecking, psychologically painful and outright scary. This is all done with no small thanks to directors Pisanthanakun and Wongpoom through great camera-work, intimidating make-up effects and careful use of digital effects to enhance the horror elements. It is this careful balance that makes \"Shutter\" brilliant, it didn't allow itself to be dominated by CGI instead it used a combination of classic horror effects with modern computer generated ones. The atmosphere created is so wonderfully scary and that is no small feat to accomplish considering what is spewed from the U.S. these. Stuff like \"Hostel\" or \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (remake) that just pour down gore and think it creates horror. It does not, \"Shutter\" shows that you must have a certain amount of skill, understanding of the human psyche, what makes us tick, what makes us afraid and then exploit that. Bombarding us with only gore won't do the trick. Hopefully someone will learn that lesson once and for all. Another aspect that is worth noting is the score, once again brilliant stuff composed with a low key piano piece that greatly boosts the atmosphere.Somewhere out there in Hollywood the cash-filled minds of screenwriters are \"preparing\" \"Shutter\" for remaking . They will try to make it \"better\" by casting some A-list overrated pop-idol celebrity. They will dumb it down to a PG-13 rating so that kids would go and see it. They will butcher the story entirely and in the end it will be turned into a shallow, tasteless film devoid of any sort of merit. Hopefully through that remake somewhere, someone will be able to discover the true \"Shutter\" a horror movie made with more love and devotion than all of those remakes combined.'\n",

A recent high school graduate who has a keen interest in photography. While driving late one night with his girlfriend Jane something or someone in the dark causes them to swerve off-road. whoever they hit, if they lived through it, if they didn't they're unsure. They flee the scene but nothing is the same anymore. Nightmares happen for both Tun and Jane as well as strange occurrences in Tuns photographs. Some of Tuns close friends are told to have mysteriously killed themselves. As they go to find out what could have caused this haunting spirit, they find out a lot more about their forgotten past. The car accident wasn't the only mistake that could have caused the series of events, the truth is much worse.In comparison to other recent horror movies like JuOn and Ringu its easy to say the film was highly influenced. Its also notable to point out certain scenes (hair effects seen in JuOn, crawling ghouls as in Ringu) borrow from them as well. Had Shutter been released before them it would be visa versa of course but giving credit to Shutter, it could be said it can stand on its own as a really good horror movie. Most of the scare effect are things not seen in any movies and will really get a jump reaction. The storyline also has some really good twists that just make the movie even more creepier.Acting is also done really well in this movie. Admittingly there aren't many Thaiwanese films that have got a lot of attention but its as good if not better than any other horror movie. It actually stays as a serious horror and doesn't go into the cornball \"scary movie\" genre (save for a single scene) which is rare. Special effects are kept low in this but there really isn't a need for overdone scariness anyway.Sound by far was one of the best things in Shutter. The extremely loud -Shriek!- or a bang and clatter here and there really adds to the shock effect. Lighting and overall pacing of the film is also constant. There's not a moment to rest, it kept coming with small unexpected moments. There can't be much said for music as there isn't much but it has its few melodic moods to set the tone.Shutter deserves more attention. Perhaps a US re-release such as Grudge and The Ring with a few more scare moments. It really does well as its own horror movie in Thailand and should definitely not be missed by fans of Japanese Horror and horror in general. It will scare you and leave you scared of the dark nights after. Shutter should not be missed by anyone wanting a really good scare.'\n",

            "Review: 'Here we have a Thai horror film, very much in the style of RING, THE GRUDGE, and THE EYE, that absolutely excels at what it does. A slow burning chiller with a handful of standout scares, SHUTTER is a film set in familiar territory that nevertheless revitalises the genre and goes to show that genuine scares can still be had from the most predictable of situations. The story itself is about a photographer who begins to see strange things in the photos he takes; a mysterious, ghost-faced woman seems to be haunting him.Before long, his girlfriend and his buddies are involved in the mystery, which gradually begins to be solved in a piece-by-piece style. By the time of the climax, there have been loads of twists and turns, and all of them are superior. They're topped by a final reveal, complemented by some flashbacks, which has instantly become one of my all-time favourite twists, up there with THE SIXTH SENSE for sheer, breathtaking, rug-out-from-under-your-feet surprise.The cast is strong and Ananda Everingham copes very well in what is a difficult, multi-layered performance. As the ghost girl, Achita Sikamana is sweeter rather than scary, but her presence in the film gives it a moving, emotional edge lacking in the Japanese chillers. SHUTTER is all about emotion, and the same can be said of that other classic, THE EYE. That's not to say that there isn't horror, because the film is awash with creepy moments. The ghost girl pops up in all manner of unexpected situations, and the encounter with some real-life spirit photography is supremely disturbing. In the end, this polished movie is a rare beast: a flawless effort, exemplary in every respect and a modern day classic.'\n",

Especially when its done as well as this. It's also scarier than the ring in terms of jump-out- of-the-seat moments, though it doesn't have any scenes quite on a par with the ring's freaky crawl out the telly scene, but then that's probably the best horror scene ever so I can forgive it for that! As well as the scares you've got good acting, good well structured plot and a really great ending - I didn't see it coming at all.In conclusion, if you liked the ring you will love this. 9/10'\n",

            "Review: 'Once you've seen a few Asian horror films you begin to notice patterns emerging, most galling is that often the main horror element is a placid-looking girl in a white dress with long straight black hair, who lost her life in some unjust way but has come back to haunt either randoms or somehow-related peoples.The Ring, The Grudge, Tale of Two Sisters, a few more I've now forgotten about, and add Shutter to this list too.I was still happy to go with it if the pic was well-made, with some good scares and uneasy moments, but to be honest the scares are very standard predictable jump fare: increase in tense music -> protagonist looking uneasy -> loud bang accompanying a brief flash of zombiefied Asian girl (in a white dress).The narrative jumps about quite randomly in ways that only make sense at the end of the film, and it's the end which saves this from being a poor experience. It's not quite on the high-end dread level as the climax of an otherwise quite dull Ringu (6/10) but it's spooky enough to be satisfying. On the other hand the ending reveal also made me chuckle a little, so not exactly scary.The two main female actors are also very average, with the male character being an utterly pathetic figure: it's not quite clear how he was written, but I just wanted to punch him in the face.Generally there's nothing memorable on offer here, tho' there could've been: the idea of polaroids showing us apparitions is a potentially fantastic concept, covered effectively by the Fatal Frame (Project Zero) series of games on the Playstation 2 console, which was very likely the source of inspiration for Shutter (tho' the game I believe used Camera Obscura). Speaking of Fatal Frame, a film was made last year, but seems very obscure: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3684484/ Back to Shutter: to be fair there is one nice scene which stands out: the photo-flip series showing the apparition moving towards something. Again it could've been so much more: if you've seen Paranormal Activity 4 and always thought they didn't maximise the potential of those X-Box Kinect lighting scenes, then you'll be thinking similar here.Regarding the language: as ever, you should watch a film with its original audio as long as subs are available. The beginning is almost impossible to keep up with the quick-fire banter, but shortly afterwards it's fine. Thai sometimes has Korean-ish inflections, but mostly reminds you (if you, like me, have never heard Thai before) of Vietnamese.Worth a watch if you're addicted to typical Asian horror and are interested in how Thailand does it.Not worth your time if you're a horror fan looking for unique scares or original story.'\n",

            "Review: 'When this movie was released in Singapore in late 2004, friends raved continuously on how it managed to spook their wits out. I recall the marketing campaign too, with their in cinema posters having put up photographs circled with strange willowy figures, the subjects being oblivious to the special presence of the spectral \"friends' from the nether world.And yes it indeed took me so long to finally get to watch this, because like I admit I'm still chicken (you laugh) in watching horror movies that send genuine chills. Actually if you noticed I've ventured into watching and review movies from the horror genre as well, and most of them released these days are laughable stuff. But for those whom friends (who are regular horror shock jocks) have cautioned against, I decided to tread safely and watch this when the sun is still up. And I thought that if I didn't, then I could have well get my fair share of nightmares starting from tonight.You see, like The Ring, this movie had taken an occasional phenomenon, in this case, those that photographers face in the form of expired film, double exposures and the likes, and gave them some ghostly reason to exist. While today's cameras have mostly gone digital, I have gone through the era of film, and have some photographs developed on film as well, so I do have some of those pictures with some of those effects as shown in the movie. It's nothing spooky, but you can't help it if your imagination chooses to run wild. I had to review and watch this because writer-directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom cut their cinematic debut with this movie, and I will have the opportunity to watch their next movie Alone, and sit through a panel discussion with them. Doing my homework is a must.I thought Shutter managed to carve some new horror rules for the Asian horror genre, such as having the story center around a male protagonist (which current horror movies seem to give allowance to as well). And unlike many run of the mill horror movies which do things for the sake of doing them, and rely heavily technically in delivering shock tactics, Shutter had an incredibly believable, and strong storyline at its core. Story matters, and the filmmakers never seem to forget that. In providing a reason for the spook to haunt our protagonists, they have carefully developed characters, scenes, and provided enough plot development in the unravelling of its mystery, giving it a refreshing narrative presentation which still has not aged. Its revelatory scenes is one of the best ever, coupled with the best possible ending which chills, thrills and provide the spills, and it's no wonder why Hollywood came knocking in its season of movie-adaptation hunting.Shutter tells the story of Tun (heartthrob Ananda Everingham), a freelance photographer, and his girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee), who after a night out celebrating a friend's wedding, get involved in a hit-and-run episode. Things start to go awry for our couple, staring with the photographs that Tun takes for a living exhibiting strange wispy white shadows, some of which Jane's imagination start to think it was the girl whom they have knocked down. Talk about the consciousness feeling guilty. But investigations into the identity of the woman prove to be more than meets the eye, and cuts closer to home that they both can ever imagine, involving a girl from the past, Natre (Achita Sikarmana)Never relying on cheap tricks, which I thought was a major plus, the production values are top notch, doesn't look cheap for one bit, and that itself lent some gravitas to the credibility of the movie and story - you just don't need quick cuts or jumpy Boo moments to scare - just a carefully developed scene which sends chilling reactions. For that matter, there was a scene that didn't even need to show the actor's face; the strength of the story and for that scene alone, was worth it.At its core, there's a pair of sad love stories cementing the narrative, which if you remove the supernatural elements, might seem to reek of cliché romantic drama series. But in this story of doctored pictures, double exposures, and the lack of focus, it allows reason enough for some reinforcement of the popular thought that our spectral friends usually return to settle their unfinished business, to exact their vengeance, a view that I share because I don't believe all ghosts are as good natured as Casper.All in, this is a horror movie that I'd recommend because it doesn't try too hard, and has a decent story at its core. If you're someone who believes that the camera can capture souls (even from living beings), then Shutter would be right up your alley. Certainly a more satisfying Asian horror movie to come out in recent years, and definitely trumps over many half-baked ideas for the genre that get churned out from Korean to Japan to Thailand.'\n",

The Ring being the most notable example.In an unprecedented first for OGR I did a few clicks research to find that the original Shutter was rated a paltry 40%, but the US remake was universally loathed with a 7% grade. Before this I hadn't seen either but as a rule of thumb where I have the chance I'll check the original first.Now 40 minutes in I thought I was watching a remake anyway, that of an amalgamation of The Ring and The Grudge. There were repeated occasions where the scares seemed directly ripped from either of those pretty good flicks, and even the ghost (when in ghost-mode) looked exactly like the pale chick from Ju-on (The Grudge). Even though Shutter partially redeems itself in the last 15 minutes I was a little disappointed by these scenes that blurred the line between homage and copying.The first scene is pointless, unless you are a fan of what appears to be bad acting by a guy with a Thai Jerry Lewis voice (it's hard to pick bad acting when you don't understand the language). However on the way home from the drinking session the central couple Jane and Tun are sorta chatting in the car when a girl appears out of nowhere on the road and is promptly bowled over. After realising what has happened and making sure they are both OK Tun urges Jane to drive off without checking on the victim, and as she is in a state of panic she agrees.In the ensuing days Jane starts regretting her indecisiveness, and the next 20 minutes are straight Ring-lite. It turns out that Tun is a photographer and after completing a job he finds all of his exposures are blurry and in one particular shot it appears there is a \"mystery\" guest. The Ghost appears at various spots, each time with a personal \"BOO\" soundtrack jolt and many times with the old misdirection trick of the guy looking one way, then turning back to be face-to-face with their would be assailant.A better title at this point in the film would have been \"Ghost Camera\", lousy title but reflective of what had transpired to that point. Upon visiting a tabloid magazine it turns out that the best way to get a true, tamper proof picture using a polaroid camera is the go, as it only shows what it sees.Then things gradually take a turn for the better, Jerry Lewis shows at Tun's pad pleading for the \"photos\" before abruptly disappearing. Then Tun discovers that Jerry and the other two faceless amigos from the opening scene in the movie have all topped themselves, Tun understandably gets even more concerned, and Jane says she'll stand by him. Cut to a baffling scene in the public loos, only a 2 minute scene but worthwhile nonetheless, as without spoilers it is pretty funny.Even though the first hour and a bit should owe royalties to The Grudge and The Ring, the movie is redeemed and worth watching for the last 15 minutes alone. There are a couple of scenes that provide real chills and the payoff is actually cool and original.Turns out that the ghost has a name, as many movie ghosts do - Natre. Can't say much more about the plot without giving things away so I'll wind up with a few questions that this movie raises:Why haven't Thai car manufacturers gotten better worldwide recognition? In one scene Tun is driving at 120 km/h and is able to veer off the road and stop before leaving the bitumen, that's 120 km/h to 0 km/h within the width of two lanes!If you own your own darkroom in your house why would you get your holiday happy snaps developed at the local photo shop.If you have anything that you would rather no-one else saw, why would you leave it lying around the house?Final Rating - 7 / 10. Pretty sure it isn't worth a 7 overall, but a good ending will help you ignore many of the faults and flaws in the first hour.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com'\n",

Whilst watching Shutter i actually had tingles going up my spine because i was really being creeped out...i can't remember a film ever doing that.

After this accident, many strange and bizarre things starts to happen to Jane and specially to Thun, who we later discover, was the ex boyfriend of the young woman who was hit, called Natre.This movie is an excellent choice for everybody who enjoys horror movies and I really hope that the American studios do not decide to do a remake of it.Ps:The end of this movie, is the scariest moment in my opinion, when Thun realizes that he's carrying the girl on his shoulders.'\n",

I have only seen a handful of movies in which the ghost/monster/cause of terror is so sympathetically dominant: several of Karloff's horror films in the 1930's' Carrie, in 1976; and now this one. And, in my old age, I think I actually prefer this one to all the others.I have watched it repeatedly in the last couple of weeks: like a great symphony recording, it does not stale---and, after the initial shock of the first viewing, it rewards subsequent viewings with a deeper appreciation of its artistry.Tonight, I really paid attention to the soundtrack, the accompanying music; especially the ghost's theme, Natre's theme. There is a poignance and sadness to the music that accompanies. Tan's memories of her; but thjose qualities do not need the film's narrative in order to function.The sadness of the story never descends to the maudlin. And the actress who portrays Natre does so with an obvious respect for her character, even when that character is in difficult straits. She takes the character seriously, as Karloff did with his. I believe this was her first acting experience---but one would not have guessed at that while watching her splendid performance.I would love to see a behind-the-scenes compilation, or something as to how the story was conceived, etc. To my mind, as a viewer without much knowledge specific to the way this film was planned and composed, I think everyone associated with it must have given 110%, and the quality of the film, in all of its aspects, exceeds all expectations.'\n",

To say that it was fantastic would be taking it a bit far, but it is definitely one of the better Asian horror films that I've seen and also one of the creepier ones too. The story doesn't really grip you at first, but as it develops & unravels it draws you in more, and actually ends up developing really nicely with plenty of twists and turns, with one of the best being at the end. It really is a well scripted story.The story is of a young couple, Tun and Jane, who get into a car accident knocking over a young girl. Panicking, the two drive away leaving the girl in the road. Not that long after the incident Tun starts to see what looks to be a feint figure in any photograph that he takes. The images and sightings start to become a lot more frequent, and after some investigating Jane finds out who the girl is...and what she had to do with Tun years before.Like a lot of Asian horrors, this isn't heavily reliant on special effects or visuals and while there are obviously some, it's not on a huge scale. That may sound like a complaint but it's not because the the scare effects in Shutter are done really well....with actors and not CGI. It kind of gives it more of a real feeling, and the scares that are in the movie are good. There's definitely a few that will creep you out and make you jump a wee bit. It's these scares that help carry the story along nicely, and you can tell that they are not used to just try and help a weak story line....they make a good story line better.The acting is also much better in this movie than in some Asian horror films that I have seen which also obviously helps the movie. If you don't have actors that can do a good job in selling the story then what hope is there? If you enjoy Asian horror films, then Shutter has to be on your list of ones to see.Definitely one to recommend.'\n",

Almost devoid of humor, Shutter shows the wrath of an unrested soul. Instead of relying on BOO tactics or typical horror plots, Shutter progressively draws you the audience into terror as well as the film's characters. It's tricky to tell what happens next which, I feel, adds to the movie; your attention stays glued to the screen almost as if Sadako was climbing out of it. I liked those creepy pics!

It creates substantial tension, backs off beautifully, then when you think it's over it takes you deeper.\"Sometimes spirits long for their loved ones.\" This movie may be about longing, but it is also about absolution, loss and regret.'\n",

Plot-wise, the Asian horror genre seems to be stuck in a rut. The films are either about a dead girl with long hair or a dead woman with long hair, not much else. Guys, it's time to come up with something new! However, I don't know why, but again they got away with it. In spite of the fact that this idea has been milked dry (and then some), I found this film fun. It wasn't dull, the acting was solid, and there were some well-devised scenes. I particularly liked the idea of the main male protagonist carrying the dead girl on his back, especially the last scene - in the lunatic asylum  is clever. But will someone explain to me how this guy could have survived not one but TWO falls off a building? You've got to give Asian horror films credit. They take a cliché idea and make it work yet again. This is in stark contrast to US horror films which tend to be incredibly dull when they deal with overused themes, like ghosts and vampires.'\n",

            "Review: 'It was a lot scarier than I expected tbh. I wasn't really impressed with the first 20 minute or so, I felt the characterization could have been better. But after a certain jumpscare, the film just got a LOT scarier for me. The film overall has TONS of jumpscares that worked for me, I actually had to turn the lights on while watching the movie. And I've never done that, even when I'm watching a horror movie I try to turn the lights off. So that is something!However I do think the over-reliance of jump scares might be the reason the film won't hold up after some thoughts or rewatches. Of course the scares did work most of the time, but the fact is that there were so many jumpscares, and the tension is relieved too easily at times. I don't know whether I would consider this movie actually 'scary' after a few months and years. But there are some creepy imagery & chilling monatge and great music that I do think will hold up, so I don't think the film would completely lose its steam as time passes. Some great shots including building su*cide, a public restroom, and the film overall just captures the 2000s vibe very well. I'm not a Thai but as an asian person I do appreciate the 2000s asian country vibe. There are some unexpected turns in the story, so go into this without spoilers, it is not some mind-blowing twist or anything, but getting spoiled will effect your first viewing experience so...This really could go down to 6-7, or go up to 9 as time passes. Right now, 8/10 seems fair to me. Now I'm very interested in The Medium, which was directed by the same guy who did Shutter.'\n",

Then I started watching the original version shortly after, and I have to say, I was not scared one bit in the American version, which is a pity because it tries so hard to scare you.The Thai original achieves what the American one, I could probably say, can only hide in its shadow. There is something about the way Asian horror that seems so much more effective. I think it has to do with the fact that they don't seem to sensationalise everything whereas the remakes are simply putting a sign to the audience saying 'Something Scary: Please be scared'.Shutter is a story about a photographer and his girlfriend, whom the girlfriend accidentally runs into a girl who mysteriously appears on the road one night. Soon after, photos that are taken by the photographer show more to the photos than just the nice scenery and people who are in it, but a mysterious figure who just might be after more than just a shot in a photo that was taken with her not in it.....What makes this effective is that during the scary scenes, you are obviously expecting the scary part to happen, but what surprised me is that it came without me sort of expecting it at that moment or in that way. It actually made me gasp outloud. I think the story does follow a simple formula in which the characters go on a discovery journey to discover the past of this mysterious figure, who is a girl, and that was done in the Ring and the Eye, but it is still effective nevertheless. The camera shots are quite eerie, and the two main actors are pretty good in their performances.What is good about this movie is that they don't reveal so obviously who this mysterious haunting girl is, whereas in the American version, you see her face fully in the first five minutes! I think this is what made it less appealing in the remake. The fact that subtle means the viewer has time to think about what is happening and discover it for yourself instead of thinking we are really stupid and need to have everything thrown at us all at once.Recommended for fans of the horror genre, in particular the Asian horror genre. Forget the remake, this is the one you want to see!'\n",

            "Review: 'Point blank, Shutter is worth any horror-fan's time. It's a taut, suspenseful and at times harrowing film that feels fresh and interesting throughout. Still, it had some major problems for me. I really liked the initial plot setup, playing on the 'ghost-photo' phenomenon, but feel that it focuses too much on the one instance of it that's plaguing main character Tun.This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but see, Tun and his mates actually deserve to get messed up by vengeful ghosts. I won't spoil the twist (and jeez, it's big, but I saw it coming quite early) but Tun and his friends are totally repellent, and if it wasn't for the unnerving nature of the key ghost (more on that later), I'd have had NO problem whatsoever, cheering her on Jason Voorhees style, in fact by the end, I was anyway. As a for instance, early on in the film, Tun and his kind, caring girlfriend (who's the only likable character in the film, ghost notwithstanding) hit someone by accident, probably killing them. On being asked, 'do you think she's okay?' Tun's response is 'DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE! RUN AWAY!'. I don't know if hit & run is viewed differently in Thailand, but I doubt it, and this introduction hardly warms one to the guy. Add to this the fact that all through the film he continues to refuse to own up to his reprehensible actions (or lack of actions), and Tun is a whimpering, unpleasant jackass.Still, I think in a way, these Asian horror flicks all relate to things coming full circle karmically speaking. Bad man do bad, bad ghost appear, do bad to bad man, bad man gone seems to be the course of action, and this one is no different, and highly effective in it's execution. It maybe slightly generic in it's scare tactics, but it doesn't really matter in Shutter, as it has scares by the bucketload. It isn't disturbing in the same nihilistic way as Pulse, or as intelligent and restrained as Phone, but damn if Shutter doesn't compensate in make-up and volume of thrills. Not only is head-ghost Natre really really freaky looking, she scares the crap out of you on a regular basis. By the end of the movie I couldn't help but cheer her on, but damn is she one mad, freaky disturbing ghost-girl. Full marks to the make-up and direction departments.Regardless of it's inability to give you much of a lead to root for, Shutter is well made, believably acted and, most important for a horror movie, scarier than being on your own in the house when the power cuts off. With no torch. It's full of memorable shocks, it has an incredibly dark story, and effectively works in the 'haunted item' angle without overdoing it. It's just a shame that the characters are so repellent, as you really do find yourself cheering the ghost on, and I'm sure that's not what the director meant to happen.'\n",

Well I didn't figure out the actual end and all the stuff to do with neck pain, but then they really threw us a good breaking ball with that one. Still, from what the DVD box said and what I got I was relatively disappointed. It had some good stuff, most of it regrettably was right there at the beginning of the movie. I enjoyed it when they talked to the ghost picture editor and the other stuff relating to the camera aspect of the film this too becomes less relevant as the film progresses. Why, I don't know seeing as how the film is titled \"Shutter\". So the basic plot, couple are driving home after a bit of drinking and hanging with friends when they hit a person, guy and girl panic a bit, guy panics more and makes girl drive away from the scene. So is this the catalyst for the terror that is to come? Well let me say it would be rather simple, to simple even if that were all there is to it. Of course at this point the guy who seems to be a photographer ends up getting strange distortions in his photos to the point where one looks like a well defined ghost...well this sets things off as friends die and the haunting of the photographer get worse and worse as he and his girlfriend must try to find the cause of it all. Well he pretty much should know why he is being haunted while it really is the girl who makes the grim discoveries. Though I figured out what was going to be the cause of it all before she did...I think I prefer the vague Asian horror movies to these that spell it all out for you. Still it is somewhat interesting and the cast is good...and there is a rather humorous scene involving a bathroom spook.'\n",

Lots of interesting horror movies make it out of Asia, but they rarely get the publicity in Western countries that would do them justice.The story of \"Shutter\" is exciting and captivating. You will get wrapped up in the story and the suspense. The movie will grasp you firmly and not let you go before the credits start scrolling over the screen.I don't find Asian ghosts to be scary, but my wife (whom is Asian) does, and she was terrified with this movie.The story is not predictable and it have some really nice twists to throw you entirely off the hook. The public restroom scene was amazing, builds up lots of suspense and then leaves you laughing hard. I love that scene, it was so funny.If you are to watch an Asian horror movie, your money will not be wasted if you pick this one. It is thrilling from start till end. And it is one of those movies that you will pick up at a later point and watch it again.Now the bad thing about Asian horror movies is that Hollywood have some sick compulsive urge to \"Americanize\" them into remakes that usually end up being an insult to the official Asian version. \"Shutter\" spawned an American remake also, which wasn't overly impressive. Not that it should be held against the Asian versions, but it is just a shame that Hollywood need to milk Asian horror for all their worth in pointless American versions.A word of advice, if you ever find yourself standing with an Asian version of a horror movie and an American remake of the Asian movie, always go for the Asian one!But back to \"Shutter\"... The movie have good characters, and the actors perform well. The dialogue is good and the scenery is great. There is a good, gloomy feel to the entire movie. It always keeps you on the edge of the seat, begging for more - and the movie will deliver!'\n",

Two years later, as I've gotten further into the genre, It's lost some of it's effect on me. I mean, how many times can you watch a ghost story with a vengeful long-haired spirit until you get tired of it? So when I got my hands on Tartan's new Asian Horror Film, I was skeptical. Although I had heard good things about the film, I was afraid it was just going to be a re-tread of the same territory staked out by films like Ju-on and Ringu. Luckily, I was wrong. Shutter is the most inventive and genuinely scary horror flick I've seen in a while.Shutter tells the story of Tun and Jane, two photography students, who after a night of partying at a wedding reception, decide to drive home. On there way there they accidentally run over a young girl. Intoxicated and frightened they decide to drive off and leave the girl laying in the road. All seems OK, until Tun develops his next roll of film, where he sees a cloudy apparition that looks a lot like the girl they hit in their car.Sounds like a typical horror movie plot, because it is. It does contain many Asian-Horror cliché's but doesn't suffer from a weak story or bad direction. In fact, Shutter is a very well made Thai horror flick in terms of plot, acting, direction, score, and of course the scares, which Shutter has more than an adequate amount. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than some of the Asian-Horror I've been watching lately.The main reason I really liked this film, was the premise of camera's capturing mysterious cloudy figures, is a true phenomenon, which makes for some truly creepy scenes. And, of course, this film features one of the best ever endings I've seen in Asian-Horror. It's not over-complicated or anti-climactic look so many of the genre are. I won't give it away but it's sure to give you a decent case of the willies.'\n",

Nothing ever quite feels fresh and I'm afraid that the Asian horror market has flooded us with so many films regarding ghosts, with issues(..or a bone to pick with someone who wronged them, leading to a death leaving unresolved matters needed tending to), that most of them fail to surprise or shock. Even the main twist, which reveals a horrifying occurrence which happens to Natre, as the man she loves does nothing to help her(..even making things worse with certain actions of his own), doesn't really impact as it should. I can't really say the leads aren't good, because I found the performances effective, but these characters have been in similar Asian horror films before(..talented artists, reporters, photographers, actors, directors)suffering from similar situations regarding restless spirits returning from beyond seeking retribution for what ultimately ended their life. So, in other words, I thought the film looked good(..solid production values and nice camera-work, with great use of Tun's red room which he often used for printing photos..or blowing up negatives..which reveal eerie images),and the cast performed well, but the material itself didn't blow me away. I will say that the creepiest aspect to me wasn't the corpse of Natre making her appearances here and there, but the ghost images on photos showing spirits looking on at their loved ones.'\n",

I did not see much Thailand movie before, but this movie reached one hundred million in Thailand box office in three days! Then I started to notice this movie. It is shame that the company did not pay much attention to advertise this great thriller, or this movie will be more than that - certainly will be adapted and remake by Hollywood. This movie uses camera and its pictures to create extraordinary atmosphere. The acting is great, and the story is extremely scary - especially the ending - just like another great \"the sixth sense\" (you will never forget when the ending comes) At the beginning till the end, the score is great and creepy. Even it is obvious that the budget is quite low, but the story is very clever and the directors (two directors) are intellectual and they know how to tell a scary story without going to the boring formula. This clever movie not only wants to scare its audiences, but also tell something to make people think (especially for male audiences - if you have seen this movie, you know what I mean~ha~ha) Basically, in the first part of this movie, the directors put some elements to imply the final ending and create suspicious atmosphere. They do not need to use blood and gore to make the audiences uneasy and scary. Instead, they use ordinary stuffs to scare people (and all the setting is located in ordinary places) This makes people feel much more frightened because the scary story is happening in the places where people live in daily life. Wow! This movie is really good. It becomes one of my favorite scary movies since \"The Ring\". (I prefer the Japanese version) Rent it from the video stores if they have. You will not disappoint!'\n",

            "Review: 'What a terrifying film! \"Shutter\", a horror film from Thailand, in Asia, were apparently you can find world's best cinema, is one of those movies were you get scared'but you don't jump off your seat; you get an incredible amount of goosebumps in your body and you you want to look somewhere else than the screen.It's the kind of movie where you know when something's coming but it gets you anyway. So professionally crafted, rehearsed, performed and executed, is a horror film that no one should miss. It tells the story of Tun (Ananda Everingham) and Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) a normal couple that receives a visit from the abnormal.Who this supernatural being is and why he or she decides to visit, I will keep for myself. It's fair to say, however, that even when the movie has many characters, the camera only cares for the main couple and what they go through.This is something you may not forgive in a normal film, but when the crowd disappears and there's an empty hallway and only one character walking it, you don't question reality. Maybe it's because you want to be scared by horror, as Michael Caine said that \"you want to be fooled\" by magic, in \"The Prestige\".Whether you're a fan of the genre or not, this images are going to stay with you long after \"Shutter\" is over. Directors and writers Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom have created something that, and this has to be understood, is purely horror. Character development, technical details...These are not the main things here; they shouldn't be taken into account. \"This is the scariest film I've seen in my life\", some friends told me. It might be true after all.'\n",

Even the comedic moments were perfectly timed and excellent relief from a build-up of suspense.It is also worth noting that the actors in this movie were superb!

But there is something with the timing, the pacing, the acting, the make-up, the setting, and so on - that is not fully as perfect and professional as in most contemporary American and English movies.

This movie is unoriginal in it's relentless scares but executes them superbly. Being a novice to horror movies (especially JHorror) i cannot comment on this. However what i can say is that this is by far the scariest movie i have ever seen. Even if this eclectic flick teeters on banal for some, it is definitely worth a watch for most.SPOILERS BELOW What makes Shutter unique is that the objects of the ghosts loathing are neither innocent nor overtly damnable. It retains the tone of foreboding from the ring and applies it to an age old superstition (cameras reproduce reality better than our eyes do, granted with a time delay). If real horror lies in what you don't see, something about showing us what we didn't leaves the audience feeling uneasily vulnerable. Though the ending becomes apparent before actually seeing it, there is no way to brace yourself for the shock. The reflection on the swinging double door is the coolest shot i have ever seen.Bewarned: If you were comfortable in front of a camera before, you will never be again!'\n",

What bothers me most is that every Asian horror movie I've ever seen (would be about 4 now) all have this 'grudge' creature. Essentially...it isn't a flaw. It's a style, a typical element and not a cliché. But still...my top 10 horror movies consists of 10 very different (innovative) horror styles. What actually bothers me a lot more is the fact that the back story plays always more or less the same. And not only in horror movies, Oldboy (which was fabricated in Korea, not Thailand I know that :-)) has pretty much the same tale. Battle Royale qualifies as a rare exception...which is why I hold that flick in high esteem.There were some scenes that made me jump (high!). Most notably the scenes where the ghost girl turns her head in the picture and where the blanket starts being pulled away (wow). And also the end is quite haunting. I would've given it an 8 or so but there are some glaring faults like the girlfriend character being pretty pointless and one dimensional. She's only good for the revelation in the third act. And also the lack of focus on the suicides of all the friends. 6.66/10 (very appropriate)'\n",

Once the party is over, and realizing that he is quite inebriated, one of the men named \"Tun\" (Ananda Everingham) allows his girlfriend \"Jane\" (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) to drive him back home. Unfortunately, while she is driving, a woman steps right out in front of the car and is presumably killed immediately upon impact. I use the word presumably because, being quite horrified at what has just happened, Tun convinces Jane to drive away from the scene of the accident without bothering to find out one way or the other. The scene then shifts to a couple of days later with Tun taking pictures at a graduation ceremony and then having them developed at a local photo shop nearby. However, when he goes to pick them up, he notices that there are white streaks on some of them and begins to wonder if his camera might be defective. But it's only after the two of them begin experiencing nightmares and hallucinations that they realize that something very sinister has been unleashed upon them. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a pretty good horror movie which utilized shock and surprise to great effect. I should also point out that a new variable was introduced at around the halfway mark which changed the general plot to a certain degree but somehow didn't affect the overall horror that much, one way or the other. At least, I didn't think so. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.'\n",

SHUTTER, directed by Thai directors Parkpoom Wingpoom and Banjong Pisanthanakun, is that kind of effort. Not a splash of gore more than what's needed, not one more ghost jumping out of the scenery then is absolutely necessary, and just enough psychological twist to keep the viewer hooked.Tun and Jane are coming home from a drunken party when they appear to have hit a pedestrian on the dark road. Tun persuades Jane that they should flee the scene, and from there, the good times roll. Tun is a photography major, and in short time, spectral images begin to appear in his finished photographs. Jane is the first of the pair to encounter a vengeful spirit named Natre in Tun's studio one afternoon, and it takes a good deal of probing Tun's less than savory past that brings the whole story of what is happening to the surface. The closing images of the film, which explain a troublesome crick Tun has developed in his neck, are some of the more haunting efforts I've come across in the last few rounds of cinematic terror I've looked into. This is a very tidy work, the creative team on the movie knew what they wanted to do from start to finish.There are a few predictable moments in the story, but nothing that weakens the pace or atmosphere with this production crew worked so hard to create.

He has neck pain throughout the film. Because she's sat on his shoulders. Wouldn't he have major cramp in his legs also? Wouldn't she keep banging into stuff when he walked around?

For example, the Japanese Ringu was not even remotely as scary as its American remake for me with my Western upbringing, yet my Asian friends were terrified. However The Shutter proved this assumption totally wrong. Not only this was probably the scariest movie I've seen since The Exorcist, but it also manages to combine its frights with an amazing atmosphere and keeps viewer on the edge until the end. Every scene is filled with suspense and is shot from a perfect angle. Reinforced by a very good musical score and not so cheap special effects, The Shutter came up to the top on my horror movie list. The only two problems that the movie suffered from are a somewhat predictable and cheesy overall plot, along with a somewhat shallow acting, but everything else in it is simply brilliant.

There is really nothing original in this movie, NOTHING. Ghosts appearing in photos, wow, big deal, we've never seen that before. Gory scenes that turn up to be nightmares, suddenly interrupted by the dreaming character who gasps and jumps seated in his bed. Big effing deal, once again. And the clichés go on and on and on...But the biggest problem about this movie is that it's BORING. It is painfully slow paced, the acting is among the lamest you could ever hope to avoid witnessing, the dialogues are monotonous, there is no atmosphere at all, it only relies on trite, corny jump scares and not much more.I'm done with Asian horror, I swear.'\n",

            "Review: 'I loved this movie. I have just started watching Thai horror and I figured this movie would be along the same lines of the old ghost with a mission type thing. But what a surprise I got. Some scenes in this movie were just down disterbingly creepy. I love a movie that creeps you out so bad you think about it all day. And I do not have scares during movies and on two occasions I actually jumped and yelled out. Like I said,that is something I just do not do watching movies. This movie is not perfect..a long way from it. But it is so much better than a lot of crap that passes for horror these days. So if your looking for a really good ghost story,watch this movie. It will give a new definition to weight of the world...........!'\n",

            "Review: 'The idea of the monster in the west is very different than that in the east. Here, it is informed by Christian sensibilities and local lore. American monsters deal with fears brought up in our culture. They reinforce our values and deal with our own mythology. The Horatio Alger myth and the American ideal of rugged individualism are all prized. But concepts like a linear flow of time with a definite beginning and end are not universal. Thus, western horror films have their own set of conventions and eastern films seem completely separate, even as both use the same basic tools.In the Jungian sense, there aren't that many types of monsters to begin with. The same types are used over and over because it allows for shorthand in the storytelling. There are unspoken agreements and understandings between the audience and the filmmakers. Stories show up and are repeated in genre's because of constraints and tenants of the genre.Some of the main examples of monsters are: A: Ghosts B:Bigfoot/Sasquatch/abominable snowman/werewolf C: Ghoul D:Vampire/zombie/undead E: Witches/Wizard/Banshee/Succubus/Incubus E:Alien F: Mythological beast* (this includes dragons, king kong, giant bug movies.) G: Demons/evil Gods** *Note that aliens are often included in this section too. The Xenomorph in Alien and the Predator in Predator would both be mythological beasts. However, the speaking intelligent alien creatures found in some films are sufficiently different as to demand their own category. Of course, these aliens would probably be closer to the Greek Gods and thus be mythological anyway.**Demons are of course mythological too, but they are treated differently in Christian countries.Each of these types of creatures shows up in all western societies. Karl Jung had a theory about stories like these, that they were programmed into our brains as part of a mass consciousness. Even if they aren't, we have been trained to recognize these ideas and creatures in movies. This is good it lets movies move faster without explaining what a ghost is in every time.Horror films are basically an extension of children's stories. Most all children's stories exist to impart morals to the next generation and to reinforce the idea of order in the world. A guide will show up in many children's stories to explain the rules of the universe to the main character (a modern example being the Faun in Pans Labyrinth) who must then follow these rules. When a rule is broken, the protagonist is punished. When a rule is followed, the protagonist is rewarded. This teaches children to function within a society.The horror film takes this premise and applies these rules to the monster. It is important that the audience knows what the monster is so that they can follow the rules. It's why you can tell who will die immediately when a slasher film starts. Those are the social norms and morals you have been taught by these films.The west intrinsically understands the what and why of Jason and Freddy. But, the meanings of most of the eastern films are obscured to us. The seemingly omnipresent dark haired female ghost found in many films, (Ringu, The Grudge, Dark Water) is a cultural presence in the eastern world. Unless a western remake sufficiently alters the original as to localize this creature, (like The Ring) the meanings are lost and the underlying message is muddled as can be seen with the recent crop of American imitations of eastern horror (The Messengers, Dead Silence, FearDotCom).The soaking wet, raven haired adolescent ghost found in eastern horror is a representation of the cultural values found there. She is, to some extent, an extension of the \"Ying/Yang.\" Men are seen as more physically strong, while women are seen as more mentally inclined, including a propensity toward psychic power. The girl is not actually a ghost, but rather an amalgamation of a banshee, a ghost and a witch. Genre mashing like this is fine. It is done all the time, but when categories are blurred, an explanation of the creature becomes necessary. There must be unity and internal logic to the piece. Weird stuff can't just happen. If it does, the movie will be rejected by the mass populace.And that's why you should see \"Shutter\" in its unmolested Tai form. Even if you don't understand the cultural through lines, there is a logical unity to the piece which allows for greater emotional investment on the part of the viewer. When things start to go wrong, as bizarre as the course of events are, they never feel haphazard. And things get weird, and very, very scary.\"Shutter\" tells the story of a young photographer couple who accidentally hit a young woman while driving home from a party. They leave her to die, but have second thoughts and go to inspect the crime scene, only to discover that no one has any idea what they are talking about. Then, mysterious anomalies begin to show up in their photos.I jumped 3 or 4 times during \"Shutter.\" It's a damn scary movie. Within 2 years, American audiences will see the remake hit screens. But, you should see this version first. It's terrifying, even without resorting to cheap \"Boo!\" scares. There is a general sense of malaise to the whole affair. And far from being derivative of Ringu as the cover art would seem to imply, the film is actually vastly superior to that work. Few movies have ever made me as uncomfortable as some of the scenes in Shutter and though some of the twists do feel slightly reminiscent of Oldboy, there is so much to treasure in this veritable horror masterpiece.Post Script. Don't watch the trailers, they give away many of the best moments.'\n",

            "Review: '\"Shutter\" is a seemingly mediocre ghost film that really could've been much better.**SPOILERS**Following their wedding, newlyweds Tun, (Ananda Everingham) and Jane, (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) accidentally run over a young woman on a road, and decide to just ignore the situation. Shortly thereafter, he notices that all of the pictures he takes for work are being returned with a series of strange smudges on them, which everyone attributes to a faulty camera part. Thinking otherwise, she goes investigating the matter and finds that he was involved with a group of friends in a tragic accident with Natre, (Achita Sikamana) who ended up mysteriously disappearing right before they got married, and who she believes is the source of the recent haunting activity. Discovering the truth about what happened, they race to stop the murderous ghost before it completes it's murderous quest.The Good News: There was some good stuff here when it really counted. One of the best parts is the fact that there's some really good ghost action in here, as is usual in these kinds of films. From the opening car crash, which occurs just out of nowhere after a conversation that's not even focused on the road, and before any warning, switches over to the impact, scoring nicely with a perfect jump. Another rather fun sequence, where a victim manages to start vomiting blood in front of the unsuspecting viewer in a gigantic studio is a big shock. The rest of the ghost action is just as good, from the bedroom resurrection that manages to be entirely creepy without anything happening, as the sheets are pulled back before the hands emerge from the foot of the bed to the ghost itself fully revealed sliding sinisterly up the bed before the jolting finish, as well as the sequence at the doctor's office where we finally understand the slow build-up of medical problems all along in a great shock, offer this one a big series of scenes that works so well. The main plus to the ghost scenes, though, is the fact that there's a lot of good stuff inside the photo-developing room, as there's three big scenes that occur there. The first one, where the photos being to come alive and reach out to him from within the pictures, is a fantastic effort that really gets it going early on, and a later scene where the photo does a fantastic trick to the viewer, despite being obvious, does work exceptionally well and manages to get a shock jump. The other big scene, and the highlight of the film, is the last sequence there, where the ghost attacks in-between a series of flashing camera affects that really get quite thrilling due to the extreme visuals during the sequence. There's also a quite chilling moment that works where a victim manages to walk through an abandoned building taking photographs of the wall, and the eventual realization that they're not alone is confirmed in the creepiest portion of the room, amidst a stack of hospital jars so it manages to work extremely well. The finale, where the ghost gets it's revenge with the photography trick coming back into play in a fantastic sense here with some great action to compliment it all. The last plus is the real fun time spent at the magazine, which is creepy and quite chilling. These here are the film's good parts.The Bad News: There was a couple of problems to this one that really manage to hold it down somewhat. One of the main ones is the fact that there's a couple of scenes that are supposed to be played off as being terrifying or scary but instead really don't in the slightest. The first one, where the victim receives a phone call from the woman he thinks is there with him in the apartment, revealing through the conversation to not be there, is such a telegraphed scare that it loses it's impact considerably by going for the suspected route all along, not throwing a twist into the proceedings to throw us off and it really hurts itself. Another is the encounter at the pharmacist window, which isn't scary at all but is played as it is. Not being able to accurately hear directions isn't a scary idea, it just makes him look like he has hearing problems. The other big one that really should've been one of the highlights but isn't is the flying-ghost-alongside-the-car sequence late in the film, which started off awesomely but instead is a missed opportunity with it's shortness. These here are incredibly frustrating and are a big part of what's wrong with the film. The other flaw to this one is the fact that this one has a big scene that is just utterly not impacting at all on the film, the meeting with the friend at the apartment building. This just drags on forever with no real point or scares to it, the fact that it mentions all the friends are dead at this point rather than seeing them play out is immensely frustrating, and it ends so anti-climatically with the suicide doesn't really do a whole lot either way. These here are what really lower the film overall.The Final Verdict: While not all that bad, there was some problems with this one that does manage to hold it down and it overall appears as decent. It's still good enough for those that enjoy the Asian ghost genre or interested in this one, while those that appear turned off by the flaws should heed caution.Rated R: Violence, Language and a Rape scene'\n",

            "Review: 'Shutter is a Thai film about a couple (Tun and Jane) who are spooked out after being the culprits in a hit and run case, but are then haunted by what they believe is the spirit of the woman they knocked down. As ever, things aren't all that they seem and the past catches up with them. Add in Tun's photography work and some drunk friends, and you get a story that twists and turns.This film comes after what appears to be a hiatus in the line of good Asian horror movies. To no surprise it takes on standard clichés of the genre: vengeful spirit is of a girl with long hair, school/college/academic settings etc. However, what it may lack in originality it makes up in other ways. The story is well done, and changes direction at points so keeping the attention of the audience. Important to watch to the end, so that it all makes sense and pull together.The direction is great, whilst the scares are definitely there in abundance and will catch out even the hardened. Add in some well used music, and you have a very well made horror movie.This film breathes some life into the genre, just when many of us thought that it was being flogged to death.

Shutter is a film about ghosts who appeared in Pictures. A young photographer found some strange figures on his photographs. Looks like another \"Ringu\" and \"Ju-on\" revenge movie will happen again right? NO. Your definitely wrong. Shutter is a unique Asian horror film, and even as a huge horror movie fan, I never think on that kind of story. I never think that \"Ghosts on Photographs\" can be so scary. The acting quality stands outs, specially the girl who played Natre, probably the next best ghost performer since Takako Fuji who played Kayako in Ju-On. The scary moments are so effective. The \"pick a boo\" since are really scary, it made me jump actually. The scary moments worked together, making a solid film. The mystery is interesting, as if you will crave to know the ending quickly. Shutter is a very scary and very exciting horror film from Thailand.Kudos for Thailand, The cast, the crew and the makers of this brilliant film!*****/***** starsAlso, check out \"The Unborn\" and \"The Sisters\", another great horror movies from Thailand.'\n",

Although it isn't entirely original I can forgive that because the story is interesting, the scares are genuinely scary and it moves at a smooth pace. This isn't a film with non-stop scares, there are bits in between that help develop the story and characters slowly but convincingly.Shutter starts off with Tun, a photographer, and his girlfriend Jane hitting a women while driving (drunk) home. After this mysterious shadows and ghostly images start appearing in Tun's photos. As Tun and Jane start to unravel the mystery behind the images they uncover a part of Tun's past he never wanted to remember and he soon learns that you \"cannot escape your past.\" This film is littered with many different types of scares ranging from your fairly common \"boo\" scares, psychological horror and your slow build ups. These scares all worked for me and left me unsettled and creeped out to the max. The acting was excellent, the score was chilling and both directors did an excellent job considering it was their first film.

Although the music is very good at setting an atmosphere, it also tends to build you up for fake intentions, so beware.Aside from that, the sound, music, and visuals make up for it's usual 'vengeful ghostie' trick, and the plot that unfolds throughout the film takes your mind away.'\n",

While it borrows a bit from the Ringu cycle, the film makers have added enough originality to make the film stand on its own. It is all done with a great deal of talent and packs quite a horrific blow! I had the pleasure of viewing this film on DVD and was surprised by all of the clever editing tricks employed by the filmmakers. Some of this editing is so sneaky it happens before your eyes can catch it! I suspect that, because belief in ghosts is more acceptable in eastern culture --- the emphasis on why and what is scary differs from what we western viewers are used to seeing in a horror film. Very often, in western horror film, half the scare is that there is a ghost at all. In eastern horror films the existence of ghosts seem to be more taken from granted so the root of the horror in these film is unique to western viewers. There are several scenes in this film that left me feeling fairly \"shaken\" and disturbed. This one will most definitely stay with you! A must see for fans of the horror genre. It is also exciting to see another great film come from Thailand! The two lead actors are particularly effective in their roles! 10+++++ One quick word of guidance, I would not suggest this film for viewing by children. This is an adult horror film.'\n",

The story stayed with me and I decided it was time to watch the original version and be spared the crassness of the Hollywood version. This makes use of a few jump-scares but also uses slow horror to freak the viewer out. But its the plot here that nails it. Good acting by the leads. This is Asian horror at its near best. I wouldn't say its one of the greatest (I will leave that title to the Jap ones), but this is a pretty good attempt.'\n",

The jump-scares were telegraphed and took too long to play out, dissipating the tension well before they actually came through. The creepiness was...okay. Not great, just okay. To be honest, the scariest thing about the movie was the idea of being someone like Jane (really? is that an actual Thai name?) and learning you've been sleeping next to a monster without knowing. *That* was creepy.That said, however, and I'm sure there are some riled-up fans reading right now, I think it was a quite good slow-burn drama with horror elements, and therefore a good movie in general. The unlayering of the plot elements kept the movie sufficiently suspenseful that the relatively tepid horror didn't prevent the viewer from being engrossed, and the final part of the movie, with the twists and revelations, were absolutely worth the wait. Many times, a slow-burn horror leaves the viewer feeling cheated because the climax doesn't justify the time put in waiting for it. That's not the case here, and I genuinely enjoyed how it played out in the end. It was well-done, especially the metaphorical elements surrounding the issue of how guilt over our past sins weighs on us, and that, more than any horror element, was important to the quality of this film, so I don't even mind the fact that I didn't find it to be a particularly scary movie.'\n",

Since \"6th sense\" (1998) we've seen a dozen variations of the same stuff: ghost(s) give some poor guy a puzzle and if he doesn't solve it in time, the ghosts will kill him, or something like that. And the ending is always a twist the lead character (and the viewer) didn't expect. The Hollywood versions have been going downhill: \"Ring\" => \"Grudge\" => \"Ring 2\",\"Dark Water\", and lately also the (original) Asians have been running out of good ideas - for example \"One missed call\": few good ideas, but it just tries too hard. But it's only natural. You can milk the same cow only so much. BUT, here we have \"The Shutter\"... Without spoiling too much, I'll just say 3 things: 1) See it. It's among the best (and creepiest) 3 movies of this genre I've ever seen. 2) \"Shutter\" is to Asian ghost movies what \"Scream\" was to splatters. It makes fun at the clichés (and also a few American horror movies...), but without losing its grip. This ain't a parody. 3) The amount of story there usually is in these movies, is covered in the first half hour. But after that... it just keeps on building up! In terms of storytelling this is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor. See it.'\n",

This movie is unique because the ghosts attacks the photos. There are many interesting scenes in this movie. The dark humour (about the toilet scene) in this movie contributes a whole lot to this movie. The ending of this movie was similar to ringu 2 but was done far better than that show. That was lots of character development and the acting of this film was just great. The staircase scene in which the main character keeps on being on the fourth floor was interesting. The scene where the main character's wife vomits blood is terrifying and entertaining(This is not a common scene in other horror movies) Everything in this movie was clear and explained very well. The ghost, Natre who walks on the ceiling was well done and terrifying. However, I still do have one major complain about this movie. I thought the part where the main character tries to escape by climbling the ladder out of the window was just too ridiculous. The ghost climbing out of the window chasing him makes things even less scary and really ridiculous. A ghost that climbs out of a window just doesn't seem scary, its ridiculous. Furthermore, it was raining, hence the scary atmosphere was drained off by the rain. A horror movie would not be scary anymore if it was raining. One particular reason why I find this movie more effective than Ringu is because most of the scariest scenes take place at night, in a very dark atmosphere(the best scene being the blanket scene).However, the scary scenes in ringu are shown during the day, hence there is a lack of this dark, nighttime atmosphere. I thought the blanket scene was far better than the one in A tale of two sisters. This movie is awesome. Though terror and fear are not distributed evenly throughout the entire movie for me. This movie has an extremely clear and stable storyline with some twists here and there. This movie has got many terrifying scenes. The last few scenes towards the end of the movie are not very scary but extremely entertaining. I found this movie to be more effective than ringu. Other than that, this movie is still scary, terrifying and electrifying and highly recommended. Score: 9.1/10'\n",

Upon watching these movies i did genuinely get a chill factor (unlike there over-acted American counterparts!) which is what lead me onto this movie.Shutter is one those films that you have to watch alone for the full effect, turn out the lights, turn up the volume and have the toilet paper on stand by! SYNOPSIS OF THE FIRST 20 MINS The story tells of a young photographer and his graduating girlfriend, upon their drive home after a drunken party, they accidentally plough over a young girl, scared, shaken and inebriated they submissively decide to drive away from the scene. The following day is the girls graduation, the young photographer is taking photos of the occaision. When he develops them, all the pictures of his partner have a shine on them, almost a lens flare, but more disturbingly, on the picture of the whole year, there is a ghostly image to the left of his partner, is it the face of the girl they hit?THE REVIEW When watching his film, you notice there are some ideas that may be considered \"borrowed\" from other films, ie The blurred pictures of individuals (the ring) the use of modern technology for apparitions to show themselves (also, the ring) the ghostly image of a plain girl stalking the main characters (er, and again, the ring and also the grudge)From a directorial point of view, this film is wonderfully made, with fantastic use of the red light exposure room, and also the use of genuine \"spirit photos\" that most of us may have seen in our day-to-day lives, it connects to the viewer on a personal level and seems to feed on a genuine chill you may have received once in your life.For anyone watching this film, I would advise to keep watching, just when you think the film is over, there is one more almighty twist that you will have to watch yourself to find out. If your one of those people who just isn't interested in reading subtitles, then let this be the first one you dedicate yourself to. You will find the whole experience much scarier, as your eyes are concentrating on the subs, you don't see anything coming, cue the toilet paper!SUMMARY Its incredibly depressing to learn that the Americans are to be doing a westernised version of this film, i would guarantee (following the ring and the grudge) that this film is destined for the bargain bucket.By the end of this film, your heart should be racing, also, you will be promising yourself to never have another photograph taken. Filled with jumps and twists that will turn you cold, Shutter delivers on a massive level and is definitely not for sissies. Rent or Buy, shutter is available now.Mike Gibson - jungleboyuk@hotmail.com'\n",

Excellent effects, really tense scenes and a couple of cheap frights that work better than they should all combine to create a solid and engaging horror flick.But the best thing about Shutter is that it makes perfect sense.

            "Review: 'Shutter is one of the best scary/ horror films I've seen. It's might look like a typical horror Asian flicks such as The Ring, The Grudge because it has a spooky, long-hair girl as a ghost in the movie, but the story-line and shocking ending of this movie definitely set itself apart from the other movies. The movie starts when a young couple that lives in Bangkok is on their way home from friends' wedding and they see a girl walks right in front of their car and they believe that that run over her. The young photographer, Tor, which is the driver panics and decides to leave the scene when his girlfriend, Jane, wants him go back and check if the girl gets hurt or not.After the night of the incident, they decide to go to the police station and hospitals to check if somebody died or got hurt on that day. There's no record of death or injury at that location. They start having nightmares about the girl and the pictures that the Tor take show some strange white shadows which are the clue to help Jane know who the girl is and what happens between the mysterious girl and her boyfriend, Tor. The ending was one of the most twisted endings ever created in a horror flick. I do not want to give out to much of the storyline. The movie will definitely give you goose bumps. A must see for scary movie fan. You are guaranteed to jump at least twice or three times during the movie.'\n",

I watched this movie on the big screen 4 years ago, subsequently bought the DVD and still very impressed with it. The news of a Hollywood remake is what prompted me to write this comment to urge would- be-viewers to watch the original instead. The story is well told and acted with enough suspense and twists to keep you interested throughout the movie. It is important to keep an open mind and allow the directors to reveal the plot accordingly. There would be no fun if you try to be 'logical' because the beauty and hence, logic, of this movie lies in how the plot unfolds. Perhaps the best tip is to watch without any expectations of it being a very scary movie. Too much anticipation and hype will usually fall flat even with the best horror movie. I would personally rank this as one of the most disturbing and scary movie I have watched to date, together with 'The Ring' (Japanese original) and 'The Exorcist'.'\n",

A day later they tried to find out what happened to that person. Even so, they were not able to find out whether the victim was alive or dead.At the same time, both of them kept seeing something odd in the photographs(the couple are photographers). Also many spooky incidents happened to the couple since the accident. This led the female protoganist to find out what was going on with them and why there were so many peculiar things in the pictures they had taken.I will not tell you any more since I do not want to spoil the fun, excitement and spookiness that you will enjoy from watching this film.Check your photos.

But as Jane and Tun try to continue on with their lives, the lingering thoughts of that night begin to haunt them. Tun is played by the very sexy Ananda Everingham. He is the good looking hero that seems as mystified after the accident as his girlfriend Jane does. But while he is more willing to push aside his fear and try to ignore the photos that have evidence of a haunting spirit, Jane is not. Jane, played by Natthaweeranuch Thongmee, is wanting to face the truth head on no matter what the outcome. In doing so, she may find out more than she wants to know. While this movie seems predictable as many haunting movies are, there are still some surprises in store for the watchers. This movie has been compared to Ringu, but other than a vindictive spirit of a woman wronged, there is no comparison. Shutter can stand on it's own as a good thriller. And Ananda Everingham stands out as a leading man to watch. He not only seems very natural in front of the camera, but his boyish good looks won't hurt his career at all!

The atmosphere is frequently creepy and unnerving. Even when you know that something is about to happen, you don't know exactly when.

There is character development that drives an intense story, as opposed to the allowance of opinion and the supposed expectation of the viewer to dictate what ultimately happens and why.Prepare to be terrified.

It's very difficult to find a horror film that satisfy me a hundred percent. I have just seen it all and nothing surprise me anymore. SHUTTER DID! Finally a flick that satisfy a hardcore horror fan. Shutter follows the nowadays overused Asian horror theme. A female ghost crawling on the floors. Long hair, pale face. Shutter does it differently though. Just when you think what's gonna happen the directors choose to go another direction, still following the same pattern, just not the timing. The style of the film is different too. It's dark. It's supernatural but still realistic enough. The lead characters doesn't pretend to know what's happening. They have no idea. Which is cool 'cause the ghost has actually something to do with one of the lead characters. It's a personal haunting. A personal vendetta. The acting is great. The direction, superb. The script is well written and clever. The photography, lightning and special effects, outstanding. Ju-On and Ringu are good horror films. Shutter is ten times better. DON'T MISS IT. For the name of God, don't miss it! An American remake is on the way. Let's hope Hollywood doesn't take credit for this film with a bad remake.'\n",

            "Review: 'The Beauty. The Terror. The Poetry. The Horror. The Innocence. The Guilt.Maybe that's just about all I should write in this comment for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I myself didn't even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when I went into this movie. I just took a look at the nice cover-art, didn't even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into DVD-player. I only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended.The DVD-cover read \"The Most Frightening Film since THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER\". Though the frightening-part might be right, you can forget about the rest, because the only thing A TALE OF TWO SISTERS has in common with those movie is... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. It's even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous Japanese movies, because this Korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others.This movie simply is a small masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything about the plot): The movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise-twists. And just when you think you've had the conclusion (whether you get it or not, that's irrelevant for the moment) and you think the movie will end... this movie goes on a bit longer. The cinematography is amazing, using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night. The camera-work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive, if not, innovating angles. Some shots are pure poetry (e.g. the top-shot with the two sisters at the lake). It all looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the intrigue surrounding them is intense. The story itself starts a bit slow, but there's a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even one scene (when the girls took off towards the lake) that suddenly had me remembering Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES. But when the horror kicks in, it's quite effective. There are also a few successful surprise-scares in it. Damn, I jumped right up from my sofa. The musical score is great, and at times when it's not supposed to be scary, I couldn't help but noticing that it had sort of an Italian feeling to it. A bit strange for a Korean movie. But nevertheless, a great score. So much care went into every detail of this film, including a perfectly balanced surround sound.I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit. It's more a mysterious horror-drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level. No matter how you look at it, this is Asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest. It might not be gory, but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed. So if you haven't seen it yet, then find a copy, pop it into your DVD-player, go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's 110 minutes running time.There, I hope I did a good job praising it without spoiling anything.'\n",

            "Review: 'A TALE OF TWO SISTERS goes the furthest of any Asian horror film in proving that Asian horror films are the only horror films you really need to watch. As someone whose grown to love Asian chillers, and as someone who lives for those precious moments when a film actually surprises with a twist ending that I didn't see coming (or at least suspect), I was totally blindsided by this film's intricate plotting.The set up is simple. Two girls return from the hospital after an extended illness with their father to an imposing, rural, Korean-Gothic house. Almost immediately, their snarky, vaguely condescending and suspiciously omnipresent stepmother (Yeom Jeong-ah, who played a pivotal character in TELL ME SOMETHING) is on them, welcoming them and criticizing them in equal measure (a not-unfamiliar Korean trait, though it deliberately borders on parody here). The tension between the three women only grows thicker from there, as the stronger sister (Im Su-jeong) protects - and increasingly, harmfully overprotects - the weaker sister (Mun Keun-yeong) from the stepmother, who may be a stronger threat than either of them can handle and who blithley informs them that life's a bitch sometimes and she ain't gonna go away!Obviously, relationships in the household have deteriorated to the point of open hostility and mindgames to which only the puzzlingly sedate father seems immune. Just when one wonders how much better - or worse - things were before the girls were sent away, the filmmakers drop the first of two twist-bombs that instantly provide clues to the pre-story, hints at a possible murder in the very recent past and makes the viewer replay the preceding hour in their mind from a whole new perspective. Absolutely brilliant, but it doesn't end there.The feud continues - and the hints at prior foul play multiply - until the father decides enough is enough and finally turns to outside help to smooth things over, at which point the puzzle starts to become diabolically clever.I can see where just about anyone reviewing this film has to remain frustratingly vague in regards to its psychological underpinnings, so solid is its construction, so consistent is its tone and so beautifully paranoid and disorienting is its atmosphere that upon a second viewing, you'd be hard-pressed not to stare at your companion's face (or the collective faces of an audience, preferably) instead of the screen as the realization sets in.Structurally, comparisons could be made to similar supernatural American thrillers (one in particular from recent vintage) where the ending forces you to reevaluate all that has gone before - and, of course, to rescreen the film to see if the director was sharp enough to include the visual cues you obviously missed. Only this time out, supernatural explanations are not required to understand the bizarre, seemingly paranormal goings-on inside the house. Quite the opposite, really, as suspension of the audience's belief in the supernatural is the film's ultimate goal (after gleefully, necessarily trading in spook show delights for the better part of two hours, no less), and a more clever mechanism by which to do it I've yet to see, even in the consistently intelligence-rewarding pantheon of Asian horror.Truly a fantastic, artistic piece of movie-making. Highly recommended. (Incidentally, if you purchase the Korean Special Edition DVD, there's a lengthy series of deleted scenes that, while fascinating and informative in their own right, ably demonstrate how tricky this film must have been for the director to pull off . Though several of the scenes clearly give away just a teensy bit too much information, once you've seen the film, it's nice to see how they actually further support the psychological intentions of the filmmakers yet, at the same time, had to go.)'\n",

Their relationship with their step-mother is strained to say the least, with the step-mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror, which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear, but is all the more intriguing.The direction is incredibly good, and the acting is stunning, with the step-mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. The large house adds eeriness, and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. You simply don't get anything like this in the Western World, sadly,and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade.Highly recommended viewing in my opinion, a real joy and scare...'\n",

Films like \"Ringu\" or the \"The Eye\"  which are praised all over the world  simply didn't convince me and they looked more boring than frightening. Well, this blunt opinion doesn't go for the South Korean gem \"A Tale of Two Sisters\". This is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror-tale that REALLY gets under your skin! The plot, based on a local folklore tale, might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all-time greatest genre achievements, but the atmosphere and tension-building surely provokes feelings of great respect. This is one of those few films that are impossible to label: the events in \"Two Sisters\" qualify as mind-bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait. Besides a mesmerizing story, \"A tale of Two Sisters\" also has all the great elements that I feel are usually missing in Asian horror films like compelling music, good acting and innovative camera-work. The mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door. Several sequences (like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls' room) are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I do like to believe that I've seen my share of spooky horror. \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" is a terrific movie-adventure and a definite must see for Asian film fanatics. A little warning for people with a short attention-span, though: this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time.

This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I wouldn't bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.If I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10.

            "Review: 'This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made. I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making. It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux \"masterpieces.\" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute. Quite literally, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels. A seemingly insignificant object may be shown  a rack of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack, a bottle of pills, etc.  but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more  a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene (or perhaps the movie in total), which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront. Such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie, but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a rapid-fire, relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness, lest they miss something important. In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this? It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summarized by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent, unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. He posits that Ji-woon Kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the EXACT occurrences of each and every scene of the film. If our good friend Zaphod had been paying attention, he would have noticed  for example  the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's assertion of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them. Can Ji-woon Kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film? I think not.Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod that cannot \"get\" A Tale of Two Sisters, because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence. The movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You need only put them together. Remember, the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind  he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that  when completed  bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe.Don't misunderstand me. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. A Tale of Two Sisters is not. It's ironic that Zaphod claims Darko to be more masterfully constructed than A Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darko not only provides almost NO objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina cliché that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence. I'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is an important one. Although it does perplex me that Zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort. He apparently likes his \"intelligent\" films in the most superficial form possible. This is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Just read the threads by Opiemar within the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned OBVIOUS.I'd like to say more, but I've come to my 1,000 word limit. All that has been said here needed to be said. So be it now said!'\n",

            "Review: 'I just saw \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's \"there's something under the bed\" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like \"The Machinist\" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions.Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi or the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror.I think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon or the mother or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink.The real stepmother, in the end, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role.I wonder if the \"mother\" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous.Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically.Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, \"Don't touch me\" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the \"filthy things that you've done\" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the herky-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from \"The Sixth Sense\" or \"The Others\".Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both \"The Ring\" and \"The Grudge\", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is \"Dark Water\" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.'\n",

I have just bought this DVD and I initially found \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" an intriguing but confused film, since I had not understood many parts of the story. But I saw in IMDb Board a message titled \"Explanation of a Masterpiece (all your questions answered) Faster load\", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story. I would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in IMDb to help and guide other viewers.In the end, I agree that \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" is a great Korean film, but I do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, like this film demands, and without the great support of opiemar, I would not be able to understand the story as a whole.

            "Review: 'A South Korean psychological horror drama film inspired by a Joseon Dynasty era folktale. \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" focuses on a recently released patient from a mental institution who returns home with her sister, only to face disturbing events between her stepmother and the ghosts haunting their house - all of which are connected to a dark past in the family's history.I actually saw the American remake of this film called \"The Uninvited\" first before watching this film. I remember liking the overall premise of that film and wishing that it had been executed better. Welp to my surprise it was indeed a remake and it's original adaptation (ie. this film) was everything I could've hoped for. Psychological horror is my favorite genre and this film does it beautifully, whereas the remake missed the mark. But enough about the remake, let's discuss this film!So this film is definitely one to watch multiple times in order to fully appreciate it and understand it. I've seen it twice now and watching it after knowing it's twists and turns definitely changes the experience. I love the pacing of this film and the overall tone of melancholy and dread. Much of the film is shot in broad daylight, which actually makes it scarier in my opinion. Since it deals heavily with mental illness it wouldn't make sense for it to do the cliche overwhelming darkness trope.I've seen people state they feel the movie is \"dated looking\" now, but I don't really see that at all. Maybe it's cultural differences? But from what has been told to me mental illness was not an open discussion in Korea like it has become in the U.S. It's vastly misunderstood, but the film does the right thing in making you feel intense sympathy for Su-Mi, I was tearing up for her watching this! she's not just painted as crazy. She's just very sick and in denial/self-blame about the situations surrounding that family. I even felt for the father, though infidelity is implied I never felt like he was trying to hurt his daughters. The superb acting (especially from Im Soo-jung) contributes to the layered believability of the film.There's a lot of visual symbolism in this, it's the type of experience where you can't take everything you're seeing as gospel. Were given a very unreliable narrator/main character, so a lot of it is up for interpretation. Though other parts are very straightforward in what's going on/ what happened. I loved looking at this film and it's beautiful cinematography. There's also the beautiful soundtrack set to it's visuals made the entire experience one that I won't be forgetting. It's easily become one of my favorite Korean films, as well as psychological horror films.'\n",

While it had an unexpected ending and an interesting idea, I felt that as a movie it failed to deliver.First of all it is a slow paced movie. I am an avid movie seer so I may be expecting too much of movies that I have to watch as quickly as possible so I can watch the next one. But really, the moment when you begin to doubt your initial perception of the film comes only after 50 minutes. So why did you watch the movie for so long? Only to be misled and understand what the main character really goes through? I feel this is way too much.There there are the ghost things. I don't know what kind of ghost stories Asians have. All I am able to see is their movies. I even tried learning Japanese once so I can read the literature, but I obviously couldn't. Must all the ghosts be slimy, wet, at the corner of the eye of people that are always too scared to move so they can see the ghost and when they finally do the ghost is gone? I mean, OK, it feels scary to hear the screeched violins on the background, but that works only a couple of times. Then it is not scary anymore!Finally , this is a confusing movie. After you think you know what the movie is about, there comes something to prove you wrong. This is usually the hallmark of brilliant movies. However, the brilliance comes at the end, with a moment of great understanding. Janghwa, Hongryeon does not provide this moment. At the end you know you got it all wrong, but however you turn the movie inside your head it doesn't really make sense.It is not really scary and it is confusing. So, I will rate it low.'\n",

A Tale of Two Sisters has had much praise thrown its way, so I hoped that it might go some way to changing my opinion of supernatural Eastern cinema.No dice!In a nutshell, director Ji-woon Kim's film is about a girl, Su-mi, who is unable to come to terms with the tragic deaths of her mother and sister; she creates characters and events in her mind to help her cope with her loss, blurring the lines between what is real and what is fantasy, and confusing the hell out of me in the process.Now, usually I don't mind films that screw with your mind, but in this instance, the approach taken by the director is so convoluted and the 'surprise' revelation (that Su-mi isn't dealing from a full pack) not all that surprising, that I felt rather cheated. I don't mind reading message boards to help me fully comprehend a film that I have watched, but when there are so many elements in this one movie that fail to make sense without in depth research, then I must question the director's ability to tell a decent story rather than my ability to understand it.A Tale of Two Sisters isn't awfulthe acting is good, the cinematography lovely, and the music hauntingbut neither is it the paragon of excellence that many claim it to be.'\n",

A Tale of Two sisters is flat, illogical, pretentious, slow, boring, and mind-numbingly tedious. The only reason I didn't switch it off is because I couldn't be bothered reaching for the remote. This might be because the English subtitles lost something in translation, but there's no denying that it should have been tighter.The story has two sisters (who appear to be fraternal twins, though the actresses are 7 years apart) return home after a stint away only to find creepy happenings in their country home. After what feels like a million years it builds to a big twist that contradicts the narrative structure that led to it.Kim Jee-Woon has made some great films, including A Bittersweet Life, but I was very disappointed with this snooze-fest.

Do we need more dead Asian girls walking slowly with their faces covered with black hair? Come on! That shtick is getting old, everyone! Funnily enough, those scenes aren't even that bad. The style and the acting is quite solid, the mood is okay, but The main problem is the plot, which is as confusing as any I've seen in many years. Not nearly as absurd i.e. dumb and unsolvable as for example \"Lost Highway\", but not far from it either. From the point we find out that the older(?) sister is imagining her long-dead sister, things get incomprehensible. The moment of finding this out is good, but it's downhill from there. What follows is a series of scenes that, though at least effective and not boring, pile on the confusion to the point when one simply gives up on the plot.There is a certain line that can be blurred between reality and fantasy/hallucination, but that line isn't so much blurred here as it's simply crushed, obliterated. Who is seeing whom? Who is doing what and when? Who exists and who doesn't? Who is looking at what and why? It's just a jumble. This is supposed to be based on an old Korean tale. Let's just hope traditional Korean tales aren't this confusing but are only told in such a way. At one point the stepmother says \"how did it come to this?\", and I was thinking \"come to what?!... what the hell is going on?!\". In the end we find out how the mother and the sister died, and the way the latter dies was very silly indeed. Even sillier was how the stepmother reacts to this accident  namely by not telling anyone! Sorry, that is too stupid The cupboard falls on the girl, and stepmom just walks out?????'\n",

            "Review: 'Film at its most profound can surround us with the circumstances that will enlighten, nothing more or less. That is my opinion as an avid film watcher. It is not the thing in itself, was never meant to carry 'truth'. From our end we need to cultivate life to the point that every small utterance that we happen to walk past, in life as well as its reflection as film, holds endless possibilities to enlighten. There is talk of Buddhist monks being awakened to the sting of a mosquito.So here, we finally arrive at a startling insight of Buddhist karma; to talk hatefully to even the most hateful person you know is to murder your sister. The causal laws that govern life are just so, that we live the life we have cultivated. Or haven't. This is not just the moralist rendition from a poet's hand, it has been distilled in every great tradition from centuries of life. To reciprocate unkindness, however justified it may have seemed at the time, is to kill and numb that part of the soul that has the capacity to love. But the filmmaker is not a bright mind, I don't think so based on his other work. He tries to cultivate from tradition - spaghetti westerns in Good Bad Weird, Hong Kong action in Bittersweet, J-horror here - but cultivate stylized appearances as opposed to beating heart or the abstract soul of the thing. So we get images of vacuous beauty, a beauty that is not damaged by life.Here the stylized reworking is struggling to be structured around something. There is a strong sense of place, humming with unspoken evil. I register this as one of the most effective in recent horror. The rest? At first it seems that the story we are watching actually is the hallucinatory space between two damaged minds, daughter and step-mother; the idea has potential, just whose illusion is powering the narrative? I think the filmmaker just didn't know how to carry this through. So he jettisons one character as figment of the other, lets swathes of resonant images collapse in the heaps of the ruined mind, and ushers us out the door with the clue of the nightmare.So even though the clue is profound and should have the power to change lives, what surrounds it has been cultivated rather poorly. It plays like an emulation of a great film, but you get upclose and the eyes are dead. You will not be worse for having seen this. But have you tried Kiyoshi Kurosawa?'\n",

            "Review: 'Based on Korean folklore, Kim-Jee Woon's supernatural horror movie A Tale of Two Sisters is as equally Grimm as it is beautiful. A puzzle of childhood nightmares and adolescent angst passing over into the world of disavowed adult neurosis. It's as fun as it is frightening.The two titular sisters are Su-yeon (Geun-young Moon) Su-mi (Soo-jeong Lim, who was delightfully whimsical in Park Chan-Wook's comedy I'm A Cyborg, But That's OK). After a period spent in a mental institution for treatment of an (initially) undisclosed illness, the pair return to the family home and find themselves at constant dispute with their snivelling stepmother Eun-Joo (Yum Jung-Ah). She longs to embrace her maternal instinct and adopt the kids as her own, whilst the pair plot out ways to expose her as a crook to their oblivious father Moo-Hyeon (Kim Kap-Su).But what is the cause of such a conflict? This is the central mystery of the movie. Overtones of abuse and dark secrets creep in from the shadows of the family home, only to be shunned by the domineering adults who won't believe the unsettling apparitions that haunt the girl's dreams and bedrooms.What's most impressive with A Tale of Two Sisters is the subtle shift in tone, but it's ability to remain omnipresently eerie. From the girls uncannily having their first period on the self same day, and all the trauma and disillusionment that brings (one imagines), to the sight of a bloody sack being dragged across the hallway by an unseen hand. It's all presented with great poise, primarily resting on the sublime acting of the two young leads and the way they are framed in one-point perspective by cinematographer Lee Mo-Gae. He presents the house, with all it's gaudy kitsch wallpaper, as a panoptic maze, which the girl's wander around unable to escape the demons within. They may not be the Grady twins, but the movies similarities to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining will certainly cause a sudden rush of blood to the head of some horrorphiles.It's a truly schizophrenic movie. Are the girls insane imp? Is there would-be mother insane? Is the father an absolute lummox? Yes. Filmmaker Woon does a fantastic job at keeping us disorientated yet hooked throughout the film, with several MacGuffins, plot contortions and the hop-skip-jump between the real and the imaginary. The surreal aesthetic, plus the beautiful score from Lee Byung-woo, never falters the driven heart of the movie, the two girls still pining from the tragic death of their mother some time ago.Whilst Hollywood is off making melodramatic, formulaic and downright sh*t slashers (plus terrible remakes), South Korea is ahead of the curve making transcendental horror films like this, which are unafraid to show some heart and emotion. Slow, engrossing and chilling, A Tale of Two Sisters is unmissable.'\n",

I sought this movie out specifically because I'd read a number of reviews talking about a \"masterpiece\" with \"a stunning surprise ending.\" I have to say it's been a long, long time since I've been this disappointed - no, this utterly disgusted - with a film.Yes, \"Tale of Two Sisters\" has a certain sense of style, the cinematography is rich and well-photographed throughout, the acting is very good, the dialog is well done - though certainly not outstanding in any of those elements. The story, unfortunately, is an incoherent, unresolved mess. \"Surprise\" indeed.Along with the positive technical aspects listed above, I think the reason people are so willing to shower \"Tale of Two Sisters\" with the comically-undeserved label of \"masterpiece,\" is the same reason people give historic figures like Kant, Hegel and the like the label of \"great thinkers.\" If you say something nonsensical enough and wrap it up in a slick enough veneer, you will invariably find plenty of people who will be willing to confuse incoherence with profundity. In other words, \"I don't understand it, therefore it must be deep.\" I say: That there emperor is buck nekkid.An essential requirement of good storytelling is to maintain a solid logical framework no matter what plot twists, misdirections, red herrings or stylistic deceptions you may weave into it. \"Tale of Two Sisters\" is a game of logical 52-pick-up. It starts with a promising setup but in the midst of the plot-thickening process refuses to lock into a coherent, final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. Instead the writer tosses half a dozen possible explanations skyward, lets them drop in a random, clattering jumble, then hastily flips out the lights and runs for the door.Compare this with \"Donnie Darko,\" \"The Machinist,\" or the excellent Hong Kong thrillers \"Koma\" and \"The Eye.\" In each of these the audience is led through an increasingly-confusing series of events; in each there is a surprise ending that plays off of carefully-constructed misconceptions maintained up to that point. But most importantly, each is a great film because there is one, solid, definite truth beneath all of the deceptive ruses. It is that jarring contrast between the carefully constructed false premises and the actual, final fact, that makes each story work. If instead you leave out that essential, final truth, as does \"Tale of Two Sisters,\" what remains is a meaningless hash of arbitrary possibilities with no reality to anchor them.It is no accident that there are dozens of \"theories\" as to what the hell actually happens in \"Tale of Two Sisters\": The writer and director didn't bother to complete the story.Put simply, we don't know what really happened, and we never will.Is the younger sister a ghost? Is the older sister an alter-ego of the stepmother? Why was the older sister in a mental hospital? Or was it both of them? If the younger sister is a ghost, how did she die? Did she get beat to death inside that sack or was that something the older sister imagined? If so, who did it, the older sister or the stepmother? Why? If the younger sister was beat to death in a sack, why is she later shown being killed by a wardrobe containing her mother's body falling on top of her? Is the stepmother a psycho? How much of this happened in the past and how much in the present? How did the mother die? If the stepmother did it, what is the explanation for the two of them living in the same house together? If the father did it, why? Why did the dinner guest's wife go into a violent seizure? Who was the greasy kid she saw under the sink? Why would that ghost happen to appear to someone largely irrelevant to the story? Etc., etc.The only possible answer to any and all of these questions is: Anybody's guess. Since there's nothing identified as the final, actual fact, they all remain arbitrary possibilities, and there is no logical thread tying any of it together. The only proper, rational response to arbitrary assertions is: Who cares? A writer bailing out on his responsibility to construct a coherent story is a phenomenon deserving designation not as a \"masterpiece\" but rather as: contemptible laziness in storytelling.\"Tale of Two Sisters\" is a pretty building with no internal framework - it collapses into the void where a solid, logical story with a coherent resolution needed to be. -ZBG'\n",

            "Review: 'Two things you should understand before you see this movie.1. While it was the highest grossing film in South Korea the year of it's release, this is by no means a reflection of it's ability to appeal to a mainstream western audience, especially a modern American audience. Simply put, this film requires not only a proper attention span, but the mood to really dive into the characters minds.I've heard many people complain that the movie starts out boring, but that never crossed my mind because i was genuinely charmed by the friendship of the two sisters.2.This is not a horror movie, it's a psychological ghost story, with a heart, and if you let yourself in, it will make you feel happy then shred your nerves to pieces. There is little blood/gore. The movie slowly builds up suspense and dread and brings you into the protagonists psyche by never revealing too much.The best thing about this movie is that it delivers an equally beautiful opening and ending sequence. And while ultimately answering your questions, leaves you with the same uncertainties you had going into the film.Do not expect a 'thrill ride' or a lot of jump scares. This movie is atmospheric, beautiful, complicated and despite what others may say against this statement, i truly believe this is a masterpiece of modern cinema.My advice: Watch it alone, be attentive, turn off the lights and let yourself be immersed.'\n",

            "Review: 'This isn't so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details, so I advise you NOT to read this review if you haven't seen the film, because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you.In a way A Tale Of Two Sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial aspect - some of its iconography is taken straight from Ring or Dark Water, while the storyline itself (especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the \"rubber reality\" aspect of the narrative) is reminiscent of films like Fight Club (lead character interacts with someone created in their mind), Mulholland Drive (character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness, plus Amenabar's films (The Others, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory), et al. Thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact, and I personally found A Tale Of Two Sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience.Many people have commented on the \"confusing\" nature of the narrative, but I personally found the storyline to be fairly self-explanatory, even if it is in part portrayed in a non-sequential manner. The narrative only becomes confusing for some because, midway through the final third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting (ie. Soo-Mi's warped perception of reality) to an objective one, with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of Soo-Mi's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. The shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard, but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned Mulholland Drive (even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies - something which, in turn, reminded me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway). To be honest, I don't really regard A Tale Of Two Sisters as a Horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness (and I hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film).That aside, the cinematography in A Tale Of Two Sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films I've seen this side of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception, and I expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future; not to mention the music, but then east Asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days.It's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Two Sisters and simply dismiss it as \"yet another Asian horror film\", oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach. But then each to their own. If you can ignore some of the film's platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart, ie. an extremely tragic, heart-breaking story, then I see no reason not to recommend it.'\n",

            "Review: 'Janghwa, Hongryeon, or A Tale of Two Sisters as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts as two young sisters Soo-Mi (Su-jeong Lim) & Soo-Yeon (Geun-yeong Mun) return home to their father (Kap-su Kim) & stepmother (Jung-ah Yum) after spending some time in a mental hospital. Things are not well, they don't seem to get on with their stepmother, their father isn't much help & to add to their anxieties & fears there might be ghosts haunting the house...This South Korean production was written & directed by Ji-woon Kim & I'm afraid that once again I have to go against the popular opinion on a film & say that I personally didn't like Janghwa, Hongryeon at all. The script, as is the general feeling, is some what difficult to follow at times & it all leads up to an ending that you can make of which whatever you want I suppose. I found the film incredibly boring & dull, I just found it so slow that I lost interest very early on & the film never did anything to regain it. For most of it's running time I thought it was a complete snooze-fest. It's very limited in the sense that only six people appear in it & that it's set almost entirely within one location, these aren't necessarily problems on their own but when associated with such a dull film I considered switching off & going to bed. I did however stick it out to the end for what it was worth. There are plenty of great films with great twists & turns that excite & entertain, I can understand a slow, measured & exact build up but overall I just wasn't interested in anything that was going on & in my opinion films are there for entertainment value, their there to entertain & for me Janghwa, Hongryeon didn't at all & therefore I have negative feelings about it, it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Kim certainly likes the quiet approach, you could hear a pin drop during most of Janghwa, Hongryeon. The camera deliberately lingers on shots & it seems like the thing lasted for hours while I was watching it. The narrative is unusual to say the least & I just think life is too short to spend it trying to figure this film out. To it's credit it's well made with a nice sense of style plus there are a couple of creepy scenes although their few & far between. Forget about any gore.Technically the film is top-notch & I have no complaints on this side of things, still don't like the film though. Since everyone speaks in Korean you can't really tell much about the performances but they seemed to do a decent enough job.Janghwa, Hongryeon (which apparently were the sisters names in the original story & mean Rose Flower & Red Lotus respectively) wasn't my cup of tea at all, I have better things to do than strip it down & analyse every millisecond or every abstract scene in it. Too long, far too overrated & too dull for my tastes I'm afraid, I'm sure I've offended a lot of people by saying this but I don't really give a damn, I didn't like it & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Set to be remade by Hollywood as A Tale of Two Sisters (2008).'\n",

            "Review: 'A Tale of Two Sisters is a beautiful film that showcases some fine talent along with some great cinematography which adds to the spookiness. The first time I watched it, I didn't really get the resolution in the story but the second time round, it all made sense. So this is a film that works better on the second viewing because you start to look at how it all fits in together and scenes that may confuse you at first start to have more meaning to them when you pay extra attention.And it's a film that slowly builds up the suspense. Not a lot is said in this film and it relies on facial expressions, atmosphere and that feeling of what is going to come next to tell its story and for a while, you are really wondering where it's going and sometimes wish it would hurry up. That is probably one of the minor flaws, so you have to have some patience with this film.Pretty much the story is about a girl called Su Mi, who is released from a psychiatric hospital and returns home with her sister, Su Yeoung to her house near a lake. Her father has recently remarried so their step mum is trying to adjust to her new surroundings, while the sisters are hateful of her. And yet, there seems to be a mysterious presence in the house that no one is entirely sure of.This is psychological horror at its best because you honestly won't see some of the twists coming. And you will have to think hard because it doesn't tell it to you in black and white - which is why a second viewing makes it even more exciting as you start to see moments of 'aha! so that's why this is happening'.At its heart though, this is a story of regret, loss and emotional guilt. Why is it? Well if I told you, it would spoil the story. The way the film captures that claustrophobia in a large house, the bond between the two sisters is also very touching and the wicked stepmother is vicious and delicious in her performance (a funny scene at a dinner party makes her look ridiculously stupid). The actress who plays her Jung-ah Yum is a scene stealer and is flawless in her performance.And the music knows when to kick in at the right moments to scare you, make you feel sympathetic to the characters. There is a sort of waltz like tune played at the beginning and end which is just beautiful to listen to and gives it an emotional punch as well as making the film scary.And many of you may know that there has been an American remake (surprise surprise!). While I am usually biased against remakes, I will have to admit The Uninvited was actually a decent remake, though they Americanise it and sex it up a bit more, which makes it more conventional and less psychological here. But A Tale of Two Sisters captures the atmosphere, tension, emotions and scares that it really needs to make you think long and hard about this film afterwards, and make you want to check out more that Korea and Asia has to offer in the horror genre. This film has a little bit of everything and it is very rare to get a film that combines all these elements and make a film enjoyable. Highly recommended.'\n",

The story has a double twist with heavy ambiguities and I just could not keep up through the subtitles. You need that surprised awareness of reinvented narrative to get the full creepy value out of this.But I did get the extremely balanced sense of place. It is a hallmark of certain Korean filmmakers that they seem to understand how to take a story that can be anchored to a place, and use the place to tell the story. This is all about crevices and corners having agency, shadows creating beings, hidden things made real by their occlusion. The place literally attacks the people, a ghost story with effectively no ghost — just a place that yearns.It is not as profoundly sweeping and disturbing as XXX, which features twin sisters, one of whom burns the other to death while locked in a basket. But it is creepy stuff. We fear place more than we fear anything else, which is why — I suppose — hell features so prominently in modern fundamental extremism.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.'\n",

For all those that like either horror movies or International cinema this is an absolute must see. In fact unless you really hate the above two categories this is an absolute must see.The story surrounds two sisters who return from a spell in a mental institution to the house of their father and stepmother. The family is also quite dysfunctional and the stepmother in particular is very cruel. As the film progresses you begin to understand why the sisters were in an institution. You also get some terrific scares. But what is really going on? is the house haunted, are the sisters really mad, is the stepmother playing tricks on them, or even the other way around. By the end of the film, if you've been paying attention you'll know and I simply cannot give anything away as it will ruin it for you. The film is supremely clever and you're required to use your own intelligence to understand what is happening.

            "Review: 'Bloody Hollywood. Stealing everybody's ideas and Americanising everything (I suppose I should have spelt that 'Americanizing'!). Stealing UK ideas (Get Carter, The Wicker Man, Deal Or No Deal), Asian films (The Ring, Infernal Affairs, The Grudge) and the best of world cinema (Let The Right One In, The Vanishing, Wings Of Desire) for their own profit! Just kidding. It's easy to say all that without realising that the U.S. are most bum-raped of them all when it comes to other countries stealing their ideas. They've been criticised most recently for their seemingly endless remakes of Asian horrors and turning a quick buck. But the remakes are usually so damn awful that people are quick to forget that the originals are pretty shocking too.Su-Mi (Su-Jeong Lim) and Su-Yeon (Geun-Young Moon) are young sisters who arrive at a remote house with their father. They are going to live with their stepmother who they both dislike. The sisters are very close, and Su-Yeon especially clings to her sister like a safety blanket. Things soon start to get strange - bruises start appearing on Su-Yeon's arms, a unknown entity sneaks into their room at night, and a strange figure appears at the base of Su-Mi's bed and drips blood from between its legs. Su-Mi believes that the stepmother is up to no good and is trying to mentally torture the two, but then it becomes clear that all may not be what it seems.What begins as a slow and quietly menacing film quickly loses its grip. The long, beautifully framed shots led me to believe that this would be a slow-burner, and would creep up on me to take a drastic turn like many a good Asian film does. But it soon became apparent that the fact that not much was happening was not a clever build-up, but a way to deceive me while covering up just how frightfully dull it is. I felt like every scene I was watching after the first fifteen minutes or so I'd seen countless times before.I don't quite understand why Asian horror films all seem to feel the need to include the long, black-haired spectre with one eye poking out underneath. It was first done (as far as I know) in the thoroughly enjoyable and effective Ring, which seem to kick-start the whole Asian horror boom. Then it turned up in The Grudge, which was pretty damn terrible. And now here, a film that likes to think it belongs in the more sophisticated category. The scene where it appears just seemed like such a desperate cloy for a cheap scare that sat uneasily with the rest of the film, and just lacked any sort of imagination because it is literally the exact same 'character' seen before.An absolute crushing disappointment, as I'd heard so many good things about this film. But I found it unoriginal, uninteresting and lacking any kind of genuine shocks, scares or psychological torment. The film is beautifully filmed however, and the two girls in the lead roles are very good, showing a timidness and mental unbalance way beyond their years. The film was, of course, was remade into The Uninvited, which I've heard is truly, and inevitably, terrible.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com'\n",

Was I impressed? Heck yeah! This film was spoooky! Its no wonder Americans are looking to Asian horror to see something new and interesting as far as horror goes! The main story is about these two sisters who have been away from their family and home for some time. You see their mother just died and they couldn't deal very well with the situation so they were sent away to a mental institution. Now upon their return they have to deal with the uncomfortable situation of having to live with their wicked stepmother who treats them like crap 100% of the time. Supernatural things begin to occur in the house upon their arrival.I was first and foremost impressed with the visual aspect of the film. It has this control over lights and shadows thats just amazing. Even the sequences inside the house that occurred during day time looked spooky. Not only that but the film had a really beautiful color palette to it, lots of browns reds, yellows. At times if kind of felt like a David Lynch film with all those flashy colors. Its strange cause its like a weird mix of bright colors and shadows. Very dark, very eerie. In other words....great classy cinematography.Normally Asian films use spooky little girls with long black hair and lots of white make up on their faces to scare their audiences. I never found it particularly spooky until I saw this film. There is one sequence in which an apparition scares one of the sisters, boy Ill tell you that was a frightening image. It was different then anything I had seen on films like Ringu or Ju-On, it looked darker...more evil in a way. Ill give props to the director for making that sequence excellently spooky! The perfect mix of music and visual heightened the whole thing immensely.Another thing I enjoyed very very much was the chemistry between the two sisters. Obviously these two sisters had their own little world, they understood each other perfectly and took care of each other. One is more innocent and childlike then the other, and the older one is always looking out and taking care of her little sister and I liked this aspect of this movie very much cause you keep feeling like something is going to mess their perfect little world. The two actresses did a really good job. Also of notice is the wicked stepmother and when I say wicked I mean it! This crazy bitch can go ballistic in .03 seconds! The way the movie is structured, you feel kind of lost in certain areas but not in a bad way. Your given very little information and the film expects you to pick up certain things on your own without any explanation...of course when the time comes, everything is explained in the proper fashion. But until then, you are left with some delicious questions and ideas to play with in your mind.I liked how the story takes place in the house for 90% of the film. Because let me tell ya, this house is creeepy and right in the middle of nowhere. The exterior shots of the house made it look very frightening...and I liked that it was a small cast, yet they made the whole thing soooo interesting and all that much spookier simple cause it was this small family in the middle of nowhere! Great atmosphere.This is so far, one of the best Asian horror films I've ever seen. Very good on the technical as well as the story and acting departments, but most of all it'll spook you the hell out.Rating: 5 out of 5'\n",

            "Review: 'I watched this after I watched its American remake \"The Uninvited.\" \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" tells the same story, but in a much different manner and style. In fact, if you did not have any patience, you may give up before the first 40 minutes, because there was veritably no dialogue nor action. In this telling, the two sisters Sumi and Suyeong both come home to their house from the mental institution. They constantly cross paths with their very nasty and bizarre stepmother Eun-joo who would inexplicably hurt Suyeong a lot. Again, there are a lot of eerie encounters with the ghost of their dead mother that spice up the movie. Are things really as they seem? A second viewing of the last 20 minutes of the Korean version (after I had figured out the story) made me appreciate the whole movie more. In watching those last 20 minutes again, it was only then that I was struck by the exceptional cinematographic techniques employed. There was that scene when the father comes home with an unexpected guest. The camera rotation and editing was so effective in delivering the surprise. There was also the scene when everyone reacted to a loud sound coming from the other room. Everybody (in different places) looked up in seemingly one seamless shot. Above average camera work here.In this Korean movie, there is none of the bikini, sex and explosions scenes that mark the American production. The complex story gets a less obvious treatment. The images were more puzzling and events were not told in logical order. The viewer would need to make some of his own interpretations in order to make the story clear to them. The exposition is very slow, bordering on tedium. The sequence of scenes is confusing. The characters were not very distinct. It is not easy to comprehend some scenes as you watch the first time. You just figure things out at the end, but with difficulty. Nothing is sure. As I wrote earlier, I needed to watch the last 20 minutes again to clarify things.Since I watched the Hollywood version before the Asian original film this time, I was able to appreciate both quite well. In fact watching the Hollywood version first made me appreciate the Korean original better. The story treatment was different. The American version simplified the complex story in a more easily digestible form. The Korean original certainly needed more thought and processing by the audience. So, it really depends on the mood you are in when deciding which version to invest time in.'\n",

Based on the Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon's brilliant Gothic horror story A Tale of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong), and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong), who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy Victorian-style mansion. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other for survival with the older Soo-mi obsessively protecting the younger Soo-yeon against danger. For Soo-mi, however, not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother's death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality.While we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings, doors that open and close on their own, a cruel and overbearing stepmother, and other events of high strangeness, A Tale of Two Sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. Soo-mi says \"Do you know what's really scary? You want to forget something. Totally wipe it off your mind. But you never can. It can't go away, you see. And... and it follows you around like a ghost.\" There is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel. The plot cannot be summarized, only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective.In the film's opening, Soo-mi, an obviously disturbed young woman, is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened \"that day\", the film flashes back to when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to the home of their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who is really hurting. As the girls try to readjust, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences.Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions, a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from photographs, and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity. While we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone's mind, we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until an important clue is offered in the film's second half.Shot in gorgeous low-light cinematography, A Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares, and there are plenty. It is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to. While the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light, it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness. In the words of a wise observer, \"Blame is never the answer - whether it is blaming yourself or others. Rather, the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely - both of yourself AND others. Forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing.\"'\n",

Film has no atmosphere at all and the only horror is through tons of cheap jumpscares, which are extremely predictable. The plot twists are so lame, many movies before had same twist yet done it so much better. I felt nothing for this film, pure garbage.

            "Review: 'After re-watching this film many many years later with a more educated and understanding view on things I'll have to up the score of this film to a 10.When I first watched this film I quite didn't understand it, the horror elements and a masterfully suspense inducing stress that balances so well that I was to scared to pay a detailed amount of concentration at first.Now that I watched it again with an almost a blank state I think that I completely understand the film.If you expect a traditional scary movie then this is not for you. This is more then that; it is a movie about more then horror or the supernatural. It does make you think it is about that, but it is more about the way your environment and trauma changes the way how you perceive things, how it forms you. And how people deal with trauma.It felt very relatable and almost David Lynchian in a way during certain scenes.The way sound is used like wind, simple sounds like the crackling of an old Korean house build on wood.It really is a great study as well on how to use sound to create atmosphere.The shots are also beautiful; especially in the beginning of the film. Upper camera shots (from above) is so well done and makes you love the beauty of the environment where the family is living( immerses you straight away.The film is also about perspectives; I believe watching it a second time really helps with seeing the film from a different perspective. You basically get the feeling that you are the protagonist in this movie when you watch it the first time.I really recommend this film and I try to be ambiguous as possible in my review since I truly believe that the tbe less u know about this film that the better the experience will be.I am personally a person who doesn't take horror well; or any element with horror. And I truly believe that if you tou have a fear of the horror genre that you have to try and look beyond it. This is a very very beautiful film worth watching and to push through despite the fear you might feel. It is way more than just horror.'\n",

            "Review: 'In 1999, South Korea's renovated film industry got its first major success with \"Swiri\", a powerful action movie directed by Je-Gyu Kang which became South Korea's most successful movie in that year and brought worldwide attention to the country's new wave of cinema. Through the following decade, South Korean cinema has grown stronger, in an apparent renaissance that has resulted in a wide variety of high quality movies that show the enormous talent of Korean filmmakers. During this resurgence, Korean horror has also experienced an amazing development, as after being greatly influenced by the successful Japanese horror of the late 90s, it has given the Japanese style of horror stories a noticeable Korean touch, evolving into a style of its own, filled with its own themes and ideologies. Ji-Woon Kim's movie \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" is a prime example of this, and a film that joins \"Swiri\" and \"Oldboy\" as masterpieces of South Korea's cinema.Known in English as \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" (although it literally means \"Rose Flower, Red Lotus\"), \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" is the story of Soo-mi (Su-Jeong Lim) and Soo-Yeon (Geun-yeong Mun), two sisters who travel to their family's country house along their father Bae Moo-Hyeon (Kap-Su Kim) after having spent time in a mental institution after their mother's death. At home, they meet their father's young new wife, Eun-Joo (Jung-ah Yum), but while she tries to act friendly and helpful to the girls, it is clear that she feels a lot of resentment towards them and starts to abuse of Soo-Yeon both physically and psychologically, taking advantage of her shyness and weakness. This only increases Soo-mi's hate towards her stepmother, and decides to fight back and protect Soo-Yeon; however, there is something else in the house that haunts Soo-mi's dreams.Written by director Ji-Woon Kim himself, \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" is loosely based on a famous Korean folktale of the same name that also deals with the difficult relationship between two sisters and their stepmother. However, this is not a direct adaptation, as Ji-Woon Kim has only used it as a basis to create a powerful character study that mixes horror, suspense and psychological drama in a cleverly devised plot that certainly offers more than the usual horror film. By focusing on Soo-mi's complex relationships with her family, Ji-Woon Kim explores themes of resentment, angst, guilt and loyalty with an eerie subtlety and great skill. Ji-Woon Kim's detailed development of his characters is also another of the story's strongest points, as it not only makes them truly believable, but also enhances the tense atmosphere between them, and the horrors that result from it.Using an elegant and classy Gothic style adapted to its modern setting, Ji-Woon Kim makes his story come to life in a wonderful fashion, giving it a haunting ominous atmosphere that often seems to mimic the tense relations between the members of the Bae family. While the influence from Japanes horror seems obvious a couple of times, in \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" the director takes the psychological aspects of the J-Horror style one step beyond and delivers a subtly ambiguous tale of horror, closer in spirit to Jack Clayton's \"The Innocents\" than to Hideo Nakata's \"Ringu\", as Ji-Woon Kim bases his movie more around the interactions between the characters than around the supernatural events that take place in the house. Considering this last element, Kim's directing of his cast becomes essential for the film's success and, being a former theater director, he doesn't disappoint.While Ji-Woon Kim is famous for his stylish visual design, in \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" he also displays his talent to direct actors, as he manages to get amazing performances from everyone in the cast. As Soo-mi, Su-Jeong Lim is pretty good, very natural as the strongest of the Bae sisters, completely determined to protect her sister. As Soo-Yeon, the weakest of the two, Geun-Yeong Mun delivers an impressive performance conveying a powerful image of fragility and shyness that contrasts perfectly with Soo-mi's more rebel nature. However, and while Mun's performance is certainly amazing, the highlight of the film is definitely Jung-ah Yum, who plays the sisters' cruel stepmother Eun-Joo. Yum is simply mesmerizing, and gives her apparently simple character a whole new dimension. While his role is considerably smaller, Kap-Su Kim delivers a subtle yet very good performance as the sisters' father.A remarkably well constructed story of suspense, horror and psychological drama, \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" is one of the best movies that has came out of the New Wave of Korean cinema. However, while essentially build around a ghost story, \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" offers a higher complexity in its construction that may come as too difficult to get at first, as Ji-Woon Kim crafts his movie as a demanding puzzle without many clues for its solution. This is not exactly a bad thing, as challenging movies often result in great rewarding experiences, however, those expecting a more typical tale of Asian ghosts may find the movie a bit too complex for its own sake. Despite that, \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" is a beautifully crafted movie that offers an interesting character study spiced up by a haunting atmosphere of dread that will definitely please fans of Gothic horror.Those expecting another typical clone of J-Horror will be pleasantly surprised by \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\", as it truly adds a whole new dimension to the style of horror that the Japanese filmmakers devised in the late 90s. In fact, it could be said that modern Korean horror is a direct evolution of the Japanese style of horror. After decades of censorship, financial troubles and low production, cinema of South Korea is entering a new \"Golden Age\", and Ji-Woon Kim's \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" proves that the horror genre plays an important role in that. 9/10'\n",

All performances are excellent, the photography, first class and the direction, always accepting that I didn't really always know what was going on, seems perfect. There is always something of a problem for small-minded westerners to tend to see other races as if they all look the same. This is a problem here because it seems that sometimes we may be seeing the ghost of a character, sometimes and imagined character and sometimes someone portrayed as if they are someone else. meanwhile nasty things are happening, probably, but certainly did in the past. I notice on my Blu-Ray box, the Independent newspaper is quoted, 'See it twice' and this seems to make sense. I am assured by others that everything does tie up and as this is not possible to fully appreciate on a single viewing, this probably makes good sense.

I have seen his ultra gore flick I Saw The Devil (2010) which I liked a lot but A Tale Of Two Sisters is something completely different.

But there's something weird going on at the house of the two sisters. I can't really go into the story because I would spoil the plot but what I also noticed is the perfect way of the use of the camera and the editing. It even has an arty look.

            "Review: 'That so many people fawn over this movie is a phenomenon.Let me keep this short.This movie's \"surprise ending\" consists in revealing that most of the characters (minus the protagonist) were, in fact, dead = 3/4 of the plot didn't even take place in reality, it's a figment of the protagonist's imagination. Which, unlike the ending of \"The Others\", makes you feel cheaply tricked, as that means 3/4 of the scares that were supposed to make you crap your pants never took place.The rest is one mess of a plot (notice the fine difference between \"messy\" and \"mind-f*ckingly complex\"), that still manages to be boring, with nothing but jump scares, slow zooming of doors with \"tension-building\" muzak, and sudden blasts of various FX - sickeningly hackneyed techniques that by now, in this day and age, should scare NOBODY. The hard-of-hearing must be falling asleep during this puppy.Most of the \"scary\" scenes seem totally random and for-their-own-sake. Scary if one's still easily scared, yes, but upon further inspection utterly irrelevant and pointless. For instance, why... WHY do we need to see yet ANOTHER pale-Asian-woman-with-black-hair-over-her-face, moving-in-a-twitchy-manner type of deal? WHY? Is anyone still scared of that? And why is there blood coming out of her womb? What's that supposed to symbolize? An abortion? What abortion? Oh, wait, I get it - it looks \"scary\", so who gives a crap about what does it all mean, right?If the younger sister wasn't even there (she's long dead, the older sister is imagining her), then the solo scary scenes involving only her are nothing more than a cheap gimmick, as they couldn't have taken place - there's no older sister around to imagine her. Makes for a great aftertaste.Etc. etc.Wake up, dear viewers. You've been tricked by cheap chicanery.P.S. The camera-work and the colors were quite stylish.'\n",

            "Review: 'It would be easy to dismiss A Tale of Two Sisters as being like The Sixth Sense or The Others. But that would be a mistake. Yes, there are plot similarities, but A Tale of Two Sisters is immanently more re-watchable. Where the other two movies suffer after you know the twist, A Tale of Two Sisters screams out for repeat viewings. The twist here is more involving, for a lack of a better word. There's just so much here to get your mind around that it's all but impossible to do with one viewing. I'm already looking forward to watching it again.A Tale of Two Sisters is a hauntingly beautiful film. During several scenes I realized I had a real sense of unease. The characters are so easy to sympathize with that it's hard not to have these feelings when one of them faces danger. The setting adds a lot to the movies atmosphere. The big house with its many dark rooms makes an ideal location for this type of movie. The cinematography is simply stunning. The music, although sparse, fits the film nicely.Even though I've never seen any of the actors in this movie before (and I doubt I ever will again), the performances are first rate. The two standouts are Su-jeong Lim and Jung-ah Yum. Lim, as the terrified daughter, is a character that I found it extremely easy to feel empathy for. It's amazing to watch her various transformations throughout the movie. And Yum plays the wicked stepmother role to perfection. She's an easy character to root against.I haven't seen many Korean films (in fact, this is probably the only one I've ever seen), but I'm looking forward to discovering more.'\n",

            "Review: 'For me this movie is very close to a masterpiece. It combines different genres (horror, suspense and drama) with superb results and it is a piece of art in many senses: the magnificent work of photography and lighting, the fascinating and very solid script, the beautiful and melancholic soundtrack, the strong performances (especially from the trio of actresses), the smart and sensible film directing, and so on... However, some persons close to me (like my wife or friends) don't share my enthusiasm. Their reason is always the same: they consider that the story is too much complex and confusing. Certainly, it's not an easy one, I have watched it four times and I always discover something new, some detail that before I didn't notice. To ignore that kind of clue didn't help me to get a full understanding of this horror and sad tale. But, is this a shortcoming of the movie? Of course not!It's just that the way of making movies has changed during last two decades and now we are very lazy as spectators. In some way this film is like a puzzle, but all the pieces fit together with an undeniable accuracy. So we can't complain if we don't get it in a first attempt. Very possibly we din't pay enough attention on the details, because this is a movie where every detail matters. From the very beginning to the very end. And this, of course, requires some intellectual effort or basic concentration. But we are lazy, folks, and we refuse to confess it. It's easier for us to say that the director failed.Be sure that the director had his mind very clear when he made his movie. He had very clear what he wanted to express and how he wanted to express it. This film is like a Swiss clock: a perfect mechanism of technical precision. But also an unbeatable work of cinematographic art and poetry. And yes, some points will be always open to interpretations even after watching the movie one hundred times. Is that bad? I believe that is one of the virtues that makes this stuff so captivating.'\n",

Little did I know that a Korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the Japanese Ringu (or the American Ring), or even quality US movies such as the Sixth Sense and The Others, and the widely acclaimed Hong Kong horror 'The Eye'.Previously 'The Ring' had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of 'The Tale of Two Sisters' any day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot... the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date. The acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the Ring - I did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off. Still I am glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that Sadako/Samara did from the Ring - after all such feelings are unpleasant and The Tale of Two Sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling, but one that hopefully won't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special. But do remember.. if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing, a repeat viewing is more than advised.. I personally didn't have time for this since it was late so I flicked through scenes on the DVD, some numerous times until I had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net, seemed Ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation. And the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful.All in all - a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same 'level' remake (its been purchased by Dreamworks) simply because of the Korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on DVDs while they can... its one of the best you will get. Unfortunately due to the type of movie this is, there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what I did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'a tale of two sisters'! And be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.'\n",

            "Review: 'It is hard to talk about this movie's story without giving too much away, since its continuity is reliant on plot twists.It details the experiences of angsty Soo-Mi, her sweet younger sister Soo-Yeon, their preoccupied and distant father, their nasty step-mother and the seemingly haunted house that they all live in. Nothing is quite what it appears however, not to the characters, nor to the audience. Are the strange goings on merely figments of Soo-Mi's troubled mind, is the house possessed by a wrathful spirit, or is it just the spiteful step-mother playing cruel games?Unfortunately, the answers to the many questions you will find yourself asking are unduly delayed, erratic and never wholly satisfying.The metronome behind this film ticks at a snail's pace. The film opens with an empty room. A doctor enters and washes his hands meticulously in a bowl of water, then stands still for a full minute waiting for a nurse to escort a shuffling, drape-haired Soo-Mi to his desk. Indeed, many scenes in the film feel like this one; empty, silent and unnecessarily drawn out.The film employs the M. Night Shaylaman technique of moving the plot along with twists. Regrettably, the director does not choose to concentrate as much on dialog or character development. Most of the scenes feel like filler to provide a wobbly support until the movie reaches its next startling revelation. The major problem is that these twists are quite non-linear in structure. I found my own mind was so engrossed in trying to decipher the most recent disclosures and their possible relevance to the situation, that I had difficulty trying to link them up with the many turns that followed. Each time the movie tries to explain something it leaves you asking more questions, shows you a load of images, but doesn't tell you much about them. The result; you have all this jumbled information thrown at you, and you don't know what the hell you're supposed to do with it. Regardless, the movie trudges along with the plaintive promise that all your questions will be answered in the end.The last big knot to come undone essentially renders everything you may have agonized over, null and void, and feels cheap, if anything.The movie is beautifully acted, perhaps even over-acted in some parts (the usual hysterical screaming and hyperventilating associated with Asian actresses). However there are some scenes that just aren't believable. In one scene the step-mother, Eun-Joo, is serving dinner to her husband, his brother and his fiancé. She makes futile attempts at humour, but is shunned with an eyebrow-raising coldness, by her guests who sit rigidly and stare at her like she's some sort of repulsive wax figure. A real woman would surely tear up at this response, or get angry and storm away, but she just sits there laughing to herself with maniac jollity. It is of course obvious that the step-mother has done something terrible, and when we find out just what she did- or didn't do as the case may be- it doesn't really gel. Ignoring somebody's cries for help and leaving them to die just because they shunted you in front of your husband doesn't seem like a credible reaction from anybody. And if the family are aware of Eun-Joo's vile transgression than why hasn't she been exiled from the house?This is of course supposed to be a horror, but unless you've not yet managed to become disenchanted by the overused jerky-crawling-woman-with-long-tousled-hair-covering-her-face than you will not find yourself remotely perturbed. There is one note-worthy jump scene which you can see coming a mile away, the usual static-hissing television set and one 'climactic' sequence which seems to merge the acme scenes from both Ringu and The Grudge together. Nothing unusual.For me, Tale of Two Sisters became entangled in its own web. It tried to be too clever and as a result left me feeling more confused than intrigued, more bored than scared. If you enjoy films like Sixth Sense, than you may as well give it a look, but don't expect it to be any where near as entertaining.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'm not prone to commenting on films, but the amount of disgust I felt for this one makes my comment a necessity.As you may have already read, this story involves two sisters, their cruel stepmother and their father, living in a haunted and creepy mansion. The film starts out well enough, giving the viewer enough information while still leaving questions unanswered. Soon enough, the viewer is treated to the horrific side of the movie, and when this first occurred I felt as if it was shaping up to be the scariest movie I would ever have seen.A slow pace is understandable for the *beginning* of a film, as are unanswered questions. However, these two traits remained throughout the film, actually getting worse as time went on. The audience is treated to a lot of snuffling noises from the characters crying or breathing heavily, as they walk for five minutes down a \"creepy\" hallway. Then, they might peer into a room very slowly, and then slowly walk back into the \"creepy\" hallway for another few minutes.As a mystery it fails because it does not provide enough sensible evidence for the audience to work with. This may indeed have been the intention of the film, but what it amounts to is anyone trying to even get a sense of what is going on will be stonewalled - the film dances around the plot, vomiting up all the critical points at the very end. This isn't in the same vein as the classic mystery, where the detective has the clues and pieces them together in one big revelatory scene; the necessary clues aren't given, so instead the audience watches as wacky things go on whilst the characters continue their glacier pace.To say I was disappointed by \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" is a gross understatement, and I cannot remember the last time I actually mourned the time wasted on a movie, until this one. Personally, I thought that the truth to the big mystery of the film to be prosaic and completely in line with standard Hollywood shlock. Any sense of horror one might receive is washed away by the yawn-inducing chunks of time where we see people walking, or staring, or frantically looking around. Showing fearful characters is completely understandable, but when that is the gist of the movie, then we have some problems.By the time the truth was revealed, I was ready to watch something else, or read a book, or do anything that was actually enjoyable and perhaps engaging. I recommend you do the same.'\n",

            "Review: 'I ask forgiveness in advance if I fail to be subjective in this review-- this is my favorite film of all time, so suffice it to say that I have a lot of feelings about it. I first watched this movie when I was 13 or 14, because I was newly christened in the world of horror films and had found a cheap DVD copy of The Uninvited (this film's American remake) somewhere. I liked it, and still do, but felt something was missing. Then, when I heard people on the internet saying that the original version was amazing, I ordered a copy from a local movie store, and watched it immediately.Upon first viewing, this movie terrified me in ways I never thought possible, despite being familiar with Asian horror tropes through the Ju-On series and thinking this wouldn't be much different. In fact, I still can't watch this film very often, as it chills me to the very core--particularly the dinner party scene.Even though I knew the big plot twist (namely, that Su-yeon was dead and a figment of Su-mi's fractured psyche--as well as being a ghost that haunts the cursed house) because I had already seen the Uninvited, the sheer power of the young actors' performances devastated me, especially Moon Geun-Young as Su-yeon. I was also wildly impressed by Yum Jung-ah's stellar turn as Eun-joo, who managed to show dimension and depth in what could have easily become a stock character.On top of all this, the film is just visually stunning. Every image seems to work on its own as a piece of art--chilling, thought- provoking, and downright beautiful.As I often say to people when trying to talk them into seeing this movie, it transcends the horror genre, and has changed my life, as it's one of the main reasons I am pursuing a career in acting and screen writing. I do warn people that it's terrifying, because it is, but it's well worth the scares, and if you're even vaguely considering watching it, please do. You will not regret it.'\n",

The overall story is not too bad either, the ending is a real surprise. What kills this film is its pace. It is so slow that I fell asleep a few times in the middle and was still able to pick up where I was. This film deserves more time in the cutting room, make this into a 90-minute feature will make it a more tense and engaging, and more importantly, a more enjoyable film to watch.'\n",

            "Review: 'I found that like all very fine films, \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" presented the viewer with quite complex questions without necessarily trying to give a final answer to the issues these questions raise. So, I'm going to mention some of the exploratory directions to which the landscape of the film directs me. By no means are these exhaustive of the areas covered in this film; they simply happen to be my first reactions to having watched it only twice.One area covers the meaning, perception and nature of what we normally mean by \"reality\". \"Two Sisters\" explores the interpenetration of the psychological reality of the various characters and relates it to what one might call the \"true\" empirically validated, external world as it would seem to appear to an external spectator. But, of course, once we are in the film we cease to be that kind of objective observer; ;) we too exist within the various worlds of the various characters and actually create a new perception apart from them.The method of creating a fragmented story line is completely in keeping with the fragmentation of the perspectives of the different characters. Each character sees only a particular vision of the world around him or her. It is interesting that in the very first scene we have a psychologist attempting to impose a particular framework on Soo-mi. He washes his hands before the interview. I was reminded of Pontius Pilate who also washed his hands of a particular situation and who asked, \"What is Truth?\" This, for me, is a key question in the film. I suspect that everyone will find that each viewing teases out the question in different ways.A second area I found interesting was the subtle exploration of the nature of identity. Here, the question revolves around not only the concept of multiple identity, a condition embraced by and indulged in to some extent by each character—even the father—, but by the merging of the self with the other. Just as there was an interpenetration of reality, there seems to be a similar situation as regards self-hood. To what extent does one need to incorporate the \"other\" into one's psyche? Does Soo-mi require both Soo-yeon and Eun-joo to be part of herself and to validate her own actions and emotional requirements? Finally, to what extent is the strange, distant father, Moo-hyeon, responsible for the events which occur? Why is there such a profound love/hate relationship between daughter and father? You note that I provide no answers to these questions. For one thing, such answers would necessarily be utterly subjective—and they might well change with more viewings. More significantly, others might find that the film deals with entirely different questions altogether.The acting is phenomenal. All four main characters brilliantly interact. The score has a beautiful but ironic character, considering the kinds of events depicted in this film. While some of the camera work reminded me of Hitchcock Two Sisters is certainly far more sombre in tone than anything Hitchcock ever wished to create. In terms of ambiance, approach, and theme, I was most reminded of \"The Cabinet of Dr Caligari\" and \"Pan's Labyrinth\"—both of which share features with \"Two Sisters\", though the Korean film certainly follows its own original path.And each viewer will embark on a different personal and original voyage with each viewing.'\n",

            "Review: 'A Tale of Two Sisters (2003)A new foreign horror classic that depends on old tricks. Trickling blood, flashbacks of disturbed childhood, imaginary figures, sudden jerks, pretty music/scary music, empty rooms with unexplained sounds, someone in bed with you whose face you can't see. And a psychiatric hospital to start it all off. All of this with a minimum of blood (for a contemporary horror film with slasher leanings).The pacing, often beautifully slow, building suspense and sustaining the moment before some new horror, is the key to the whole mood. And the photography, with its movement through the interior of this large, rambling house, is impeccable. The lead actresses are purposely a little confusing, visually, not just to non-Korean eyes. When we see a thin figure with dark hair on a chair, we are rarely sure at first who it is. The confusion, to some extent, is exactly what the movie is about--and the horror of being disturbed by uncertainty.If you don't completely get sucked in, you might find (as I did) that the manipulation by the film on the viewer is sometimes so calculated you just say, come on, say something. A couple conversations in particular have one girl angry at someone, and unable to actually say what it is they are angry about, or that they just saw a hand dart out from under the sink, or whatever. The willful withholding of information from the viewer, not just in dialog, is part of building suspense, but it has to happen in a way that doesn't draw attention to itself, and here I was aware too often that the movie was playing tricks on us. Still scary and weird, but a cheap way to those ends. (For examples that don't do this, see The Shining and note how reasonable everyone's actions are, and how the film isn't hiding things from us. Likewise, Hitchcock kinds of suspense, say in Psycho, are logically part of the very believable narrative flow.)But swallow this objection and you'll be sucked in all the way, wondering exactly who did what to whom.'\n",

            "Review: 'At first glance, A TALE OF TWO SISTERS appears to be very typical slice of Asian horror, with a family haunted by a tragic, long-haired female ghost from the past who has a tendency to pop up in bedrooms and other unexpected places. At the close, though, it's been something entirely different: a complex and convoluted mystery with a unique psychological slant that plays more guessing games with the viewer than a dozen SIXTH SENSES.To say too much about the storyline would be to spoil the experience, although to be honest I'm still not entirely sure what I watched; this is the kind of film that positively demands repeated viewings in order to make sense of the dense plotting and abstract imagery. It's certainly atypical, and despite a few clichéd moments where the protagonists are haunted by a ghost in scenes that directly copy THE GRUDGE and its ilk, this is imaginatively done and very well handled by director Kim Jee-Woon.The acting is typically strong for a South Korean movie, with the two actresses playing the sisters both particularly enthralling and delivering heartfelt performances. The movie is by turns frightening, disturbing, tragic and breathtaking, and delivers a twist ending that M. Night Shymalan could only dream of. Not what I would call an openly entertaining film – this one requires lots of concentration and close attention to solve the myriad puzzles – but certainly a rewarding one.'\n",

            "Review: 'I saw this because I had been hearing a lot of great things about this, so I decided to rent this. I loved it so much, that I bought it the very next day.The first thing the viewer will probably notice is the cinematography. It's simply beautiful- the scenery and vibrant colors are balanced just right, and you can really tell the film-makers tried hard to get the best camera angles and shots. Another thing the viewers will notice it the acting: it's outstanding throughout, with a fairly creepy performance from Jung-ah Yum and a beautifully depressing performance from Su-jeong Lim. More noticeable acting comes from Geun-yeong Mun, who also gave a very sad and beautiful performance.A real problem that some people have with the movie (which I don't have) are the multi plot plot twists. Yes, once they are revealed, thing get very very confusing. But there's something called 're-watching', something some users here have not heard of and have simply passed this gem off as either \"boring\" or \"confusing mess\". Yes, the pacing is fairly slow, but that was intended because the director knew he had to give time to develop a plot. Another problem some people have is, at one point, you can tell this movie was clearly influenced by a few other movies (mainly the classic \"Ring\"). The ghost is somewhat similar to two famous Japanese ghosts, and that is evident in a certain dream sequence that takes place.But personally, I don't have any complaints. This is a beautiful and (strangely at the same time) unnervingly terrifying film that really needs to be seen more. And like \"The Ring\" and \"The grudge\", this is sadly getting a US remake. Really, I think Hollywood has lost it's touch.Anyways, this is an outstanding masterpiece that resonates in every aspect. Please, watch this and I promise you won't regret it.10/10.'\n",

Both movies are about two sisters who have a very antagonistic relationship with their stepmother, who was once a nurse charged with the care of their sick (and now dead) mother, and was the catalyst for a tragic event that happened in their lives. A Tale of Two Sisters has much more of a supernatural element than The Uninvited, which is a more straight-forward movie. The endings are very different, as well. Which one you prefer probably will depend on how much \"psychological\" you like in your psychological horror. A Tale of Two Sisters takes the concept seriously and may confuse the viewer a bit along the way, but it all ties together neatly in the end. I liked the movie, but it probably would have had more of an impact on me if I had seen it back when it was first released in 2003, or at least before I had most of the story spoiled from watching The Uninvited.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'm no real fan of the Asian horror that's sweeping in over the world right now. I find it quite hard to see exactly why Asian horror seems to have become so popular with so many people. Especially since most of the movies in the genre are very hard to separate from each other.This is the story of two sisters who are released from a mental institution. They return home to their father and his new wife. They instantly dislike their stepmother and also strange things are beginning to happen. Things that might have to do with their dead mother...First of all there is nothing to complain about technically here. The movie is well made with nice photography, good cinematography and nice music. The effects (that are not plentiful) are also well done. The problem with this movie is not in this department. No, rather the almost complete lack of originality is to blame. I don't understand the Asian horror genre. Asian cinema is usually among the most inventive and vigorous in the world, and South Korea is definitely at the fore-front. But when it comes to horror the Asian countries seem stuck in a loop. Ringu, Dark Water, The Eye etc. There is just nothing new here.The method of building tension and then releasing it with a loud noise might be efficient when it comes to scaring people. But i must confess i'm getting a little tired of it. And like the whole movie there is nothing new on display when it comes to shock-effects.The only really inventive thing here is the plot. Which starts out with a regular \"spirits of the forefathers back to haunt us\"-routine, but then takes a sharp turn into something else. A turn that most closely reminds me of M. Night Shyamalans movies. It's not a very wise turn though since this more or less garbles the story completely and leaves all feelings of coherence behind. And also the running time of almost two hours is far too long.This is a movie that makes many mistakes, the biggest one is to follow the pack and not having the guts to make something original. I guess fans of the genre may find this a decent entry into the bunch of similar movies. To me though, this was nothing special and i found it rather dull. I rate it 3/10.'\n",

There were pratically no frightening scenes in this movie. Other than that, this movie is great, interesting with many many twists. The ending, was probably one of the most unexpected ending any movie would have. This movie is so original in terms of the storyline. There was no murders only not helping others when they are in need. Lots of hallucinations were used in this movie. This movie was extremely slow at first, but just let the movie slowly grab you. Eventually, it does grab into you and you will be very satisfied with this film. Many weird things happen in this film which makes this film interesting. The storyline is a very unique one. There is a lot of character development in this film. The acting was good, the cinematography was good. The hallucinations of the main character were used well. This movie just shows how one mistake can lead to terrible consequences that will occur in a person. This movie is very original, if you like shows like Reincarnation, you will like this movie.

It has the perfect amount of creepiness to keep you interested but doesn't go too overboard.

It's not even just my favorite horror movie it could possibly be just one of my all time favorite movies in general.

            "Review: 'Now this was a movie that I first heard about in college. For whatever reason, I hadn't gotten around to watching it, but I knew about it since it got a lot of buzz in the states. Something that I didn't know was that it was the first Korean film to get a wide release to theaters. Now I'm not completely sure if this was in the horror genre or just in general. I will admit here that I did see the American remake first and it was one that I enjoyed, but was excited to see where they were inspired from. They synopsis is a family is haunted by the tragedies of deaths within the family.Now for this, I'm going to give the most general overview of this as there are a lot of moving parts and things that need to be experienced. We start this off with Soo-mi Bae (Soo-jung Lim) as a doctor (Dae-yeon Lee) asks her questions. She doesn't respond to him though.We then shift to a car arriving at a fairly large house. The person driving is the father, Moo-hyeon Bae (Kap-su Kim). With him are his two daughters of Soo-mi and Soo-yeon (Geun-young Moon). Before going into the house, they go down to a pond nearby. When they finally go into the house, they come face to face with their stepmother, Eun-joo Heo (Jung-ah Yum). There is quite a bit of tension here before the girls go up to their room.Through pictures, we learn that the animosity is from Eun-joo is a doctor. Their mother of Mrs. Bae (Mi-hyeon Park) is how Eun-joo comes in contact with the family and the fact that she has now married their father bothers them. Soo-yeon is more timid, so Soo-mi wants her to tell her everything that happens so she can protect her.As the tensions rise in the house, Eun-joo wants to invite over her brother and his wife. They are Sun-kyu (Gi-hong Woo) and Mi-hee (Seung-bi Lee). It ends up just being Eun-joo and Moo-hyeon that meet with them and it is an awkward dinner scene. It all ends with Mi-hee going into a fit and she thinks she saw something.She isn't the only one that thinks she sees something. All of the women here think they see ghosts, which one of them is thought to be Mrs. Bae herself. This bothers Moo-hyeon and one of his reactions is that maybe Soo-mi isn't cured like they thought. It becomes a question of what is real and what is going on in this house. They must figure it out before it is too late.Now I think that gets you up to speed without going into spoilers as that is something I don't really want to do. This is definitely a movie I think that people need to experience. I'm a little bit mad at myself for watching The Uninvited a couple of times before coming in, because that of course spoils what the reveal is here since it is a remake. What I will say though, it didn't hinder my enjoyment of this movie though as this goes much deeper and without playing my hand too much, this is of course better.Where I want to start with this analysis is that coming in to watch this, something in the Shudder description caught my eye. That is where I saw this movie so thanks to them for having it available. What they said there was Shakespearian and I think that is a really good description of what we get here of being a tragedy. It sets the tone from the beginning with Soo-mi being in a mental hospital or at least has been kept somewhere where she has to talk to a doctor. We don't know though if that is the present of the past, which I like it giving us that we have an unreliable narrator. This can be a tough line to tip-toe, as I hate when they put everything in a character's head. This movie does it very well in my opinion.As I said, since I knew what the reveal was, I was watching characters to see how they interact. I have to say that I was sucked in as this movie is much deeper in what they do with their story. I'm not going to spend most of this comparing it to the American remake, but what I will give credit for is playing up the supernatural elements more and being from South Korea, lean into it as well. There were a few scenes that I remembered as they were pulled from here. They don't make as much sense now seeing what it means here though as the other really is using it for scares without truly fleshing it out in my opinion.Before I get away from making my point though about the Shakespearian tragedy though, this is all hinged on what happened to Mrs. Bae. We know that she passed away, hence why Eun-joo is there. Seeing that she killed herself and the effect that it had on Soo-yeon is great. It does explain why she is scared of a wardrobe. Now for those who have seen the movie, the reveal is both aggregating and sad. I will be honest though, I was a bit confused at the end. I did read up on some trivia which confirmed some of the things I thought and then filled in what I missed. Without that, this would be much more difficult to piece together.What really helps this though is the acting. It is odd as I'm writing this, as no one really stands out to be honest. Kim is someone that is suck between a rock and a hard place. You don't want to blame him for moving on, but it is tough who he has 'chosen'. He wants what is best for everybody; it is just that everything is wearing on him. Yum is probably the best performance to be honest. We see when everyone gets to the house, how she has just taken over. There is a flip to her character though that is completely different and I loved it, especially learning the reveal. Lim is solid and I think along with Moon, they show a lot of depression and sadness. Soo-yeon is a bit more subdued, which makes sense while Soo-jung is strong, but barely hanging on. The rest of the cast rounds this out for what was needed.The last thing to really go over would be the effects. I love that we don't get a lot of them as it doesn't really need them. They do so well with the practical effects in the movie. There is a creepy scene with Mrs. Bae that involved blood running down her leg and a hand. This was something I read up on and it made sense after piecing it together. We also get things that you don't necessarily know are real or not, but it all makes sense in the end. The cinematography is also well done in framing shots and I have to give credit there.Now with that said, I'm glad that I finally saw this movie. It truly is superior how they frame this story with a character that is unreliable and we question everything that we are seeing. It coming from South Korea, they don't shy away from the supernatural elements and I really like that. The story is deeper and I think that the acting, although no one stands out, it still works for me. There aren't a lot of effects, but it didn't necessarily need them. The soundtrack also fit for what was needed in developing the atmosphere. I would say that this is a good movie and would recommend giving it a viewing. I will warn you; this is foreign so I did watch it with subtitles. If that is an issue then I would say to avoid it. You are missing out though on an interesting take on the haunted house/psychologically broken/unreliable narrator narrative.'\n",

            "Review: 'This was a very interesting and creepy movie from Korea...good story, beautiful visually, and great music too. Perfect, no it had a flaw or two, overall though I thought it was a very good Asian horror movie. The tale has these two sisters coming home from what was apparently a stay at a hospital. Upon their arrival they are greeted warmly at first by their stepmother. However, as things move along the stepmother seems to grow more and more hostile to the two sisters, especially the younger one who is more quiet and reserved unlike the older sibling who seems able to take up for herself. That is about all I am going to say though as I don't want to give it away, I was somewhat confused on first viewing, but after going to the message boards here and re-watching the movie I pretty much get it now with the exception of the flaws I mentioned. The flaws are probably the scariest bits in the film, but they seem to serve no other purpose to the story except to scare. There are three scenes like this in the flick...the dream sequence with the black figure ghost (I know who she is, but not the point of the dream), the dinner scene with the woman going into fits and the apparition under the sink, and the scene near the end involving the step mum. Like I said, these scenes just did not seem to fit in, and seem like they were added just for cheap scares, but if anyone can explain them in context to the story feel free to private message me. The rest of the film is great though and the ending was a surprise for me.'\n",

            "Review: 'At this point there have been so many reviews of \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" (ATOTS) here, and so many reveals, that I'm just going to assume you (the reader) know the basic plot twist and then tell you why I was disappointed. The ultimate reveal in this movie is this: Su-mi's real mother committed suicide in an armoire. When Su-mi's younger sister, Su-yeon, found her mom and tried to help her the armoire fell over on her, but she didn't die instantly. She struggled, pinned beneath it, when her the step mother to be, Eun-ju, found her. Eun-ju, who it is suggested was having an affair with the father long before the mom killed herself and did not like the daughters, leaves Su-yeon struggling beneath the amoire. But as she beats a hasty retreat from the room Su-mi catches her (Su-mi doesn't know her beloved sister is just feet away struggling beneath that heavy piece of furniture). Su-mi hates Eun-ju so much that she doesn't see that glimpse of guilt in her eyes over what she just walked away from. Instead, Su-mi engages Eun-ju is some bitter wordplay and the step mom warns her that she will live to regret this moment (we get the feeling the Eun-ju was going to reveal what she saw if Su-mi had played her hand differently).Later, when Su-mi realizes that she inadvertently caused her sister's death, she goes nuts and is institutionalized. The film starts when Su-mi returns home, with what appears to be her sister Su-yeon. She is greeted by the evil step mom and strange things begin to happen in the house where everything I described transpired. We later realize, Su-mi has created the step mom and the sister in her mind and is replaying fantasy scenarios with them where she can rescue her sister to alleviate the guilt she has for inadvertently letting Su-yeon die. (This was described excellently by the \"featured review\" here on IMDb.) But there are scenes where this doesn't make sense, and the sister seems to have her own identity (e.g., ghost) and not be a figment of Su-mi's imagination.I've seen most of the good Asian horror movies: Ringhu, Dark Water, Ringhu 2, Ju-on, etc. The thing I like about these movies is that they are so different from American films in their style and pacing. It's ultimately this difference that allows them to be truly scary. But with ATOTS, the Western influences and legacy of Asian films have left their mark. In short, this film is so busy trying to live up to this canon of films, while borrowing a few nifty tricks from the best of Western psychological thrillers, that is gives off the distinct feeling of being pretentious and trying too hard.The aforementioned reveal is a very potent piece of story telling (based on a South Korean folk tale that has been remade fives times into a movie). And because the lead character has gone psycho, and the story is told through her eyes, the director has a lot of leeway to concoct stuff under the guise of it being a crumpling psyche. In short, the director had a great premise he could go anywhere with. But instead of paying homage to it and treating it with dignity, he used it to copycat the scares in the best Asian horror films of the last decade and play cutesy with the actors--don't even begin to tell me Yeom Jeong-ah, the actress playing the step mom--was not allowed to chew the scenery channeling the best Asian Nicole Kidman ever). People say you have to see this movie twice to appreciate it, and maybe their right, but based on my initial viewing I can't help but think that at least half the scares had no real purpose or connection to the story; that the director was just abusing the \"Su-mi is crazy\" theme to invent some cheap thrills.Technically, the movie is highly accomplished. It looks far and away better than the other Asian horror movies I've seen. But this also detracts from its efficacy. Ringhu benefited from its stark, almost documentary like story telling. This movie is so lush and well shot that you immediately feel the director is trying to manipulate and impress the audience--making his best bid for a big budget American remake.Overall, certainly not a waste of time. And I will see it again, but right now I'm not nearly as blown away as most of the reviewers here.'\n",

To be blunt, this is one of the greatest horror films I have ever seen; a celluloid work of art that first intrigues, then shocks, terrifies, and stays with you long after it's over.This well-written story, part supernatural and part psychological, is brought to life in the nuanced performances of the talented cast. The cinematography has a fresh feel, with some interesting framing and variations. I've seen lots of experimental camera work in Asian cinema, but here its subtly and quite beautifully done. The lighting is also done remarkably well. A genuinely scary movie that's also a joy to watch.In all seriousness, I can't praise this film highly enough.

However, the gore was at a minimum level, and the horror aspect was incredibly subtle.There is almost no music, either, creating a bit of an unnerving atmosphere. The focus, at least from what I could tell, was on the vibrant colors. I noticed a distinct vibrancy in the green shades, which is not a common color to highlight in films.I definitely need to see the film a second time now that I know it has a slower pace. It would change the way I approached it and I would get more out of it.'\n",

            "Review: 'I remind myself, whenever I attend a screening of a new film, of an ideal experience I had with a previous one of similar style. I recall several distinct films in my mind. Good movies are memorable, while great ones violate the construct of time and remain at the precise moment I first watched them. Kim Ji-woon's A Tale of Two Sisters is one such film. It's one of the best of recent years and expects the viewer to recognize its greatness. This, like Let the Right One in, is not a genre picture. Ji-woon's film is an ecstasy of subtle nightmares that is more frightening than anything Freddy, Jason, or Jigsaw have shown us. I had to stop my blu-ray player while watching to forcefully break the overbearing atmosphere or think about what was happening on screen.A Tale of Two Sisters is superbly constructed. Every shot is part of a large psychological puzzle that is reminiscent of Norman Bate's affliction. What we see occur is not how we think it is. It follows the ghost story formula but is too smart to fall into clichés. A young girl creates an imaginary friend, of sort, to cope with a tragic event. At the very end, her father reveals that she is suffering from a self-indulged delusion. She recreates situations in her mind to trick us into sympathizing with her. It gets even worse. She also envisions violent actions taken by someone who isn't present, at the moment, in order to assuage her own suppressed feelings. I've simplified it too much. Don't think about a clichéd ghost story where it's painstakingly obvious that someone is communicating with the dead. No, A Tale of Two Sisters is so effective in creating living otherworldly that I assumed there were no spirits until the end.There is no excessive makeup, no evil presence, no anything conspicuously unnatural about the film. It's just a father spending a weekend with his daughters at a beautiful lake house. Two girls emerge from a vehicle and are greeted by their step mother. Su-mi, the older one, hates her new step mother Eun-joo. The younger one, Su-yeon, is less aggressive in her hatred but it's obvious. Both of them plead their father, Moo-hyeon, to dump her and live alone. Eun-joo was a nurse at the hospital where Moo-hyeon works and probably had an affair with him when his wife was alive. Despite her presumed innocence, Eun-joo beats Su-yeon many times. She even locks her in the closet for noncompliance. Su-mi is haunted but never actually attacked by Eun-joo. These scary sequences are spliced throughout the film and increase the suspense to almost unbearable levels. They are also the only times when night is visible on screen. Eeriness pervades even sunshine.At a dinner party, Su-mi observes a guest fall to the floor in convulsion and an undead Asian horror movie girl under the sink. Both events fade quickly but she never recovers. She then imagines Eun-joo about to kill her before her father steps in and says \"Su-yeon is dead.\" She's been dead the whole time. In actuality, Su-yeon died while her sister and Eun-joo were having an argument. She opens a wardrobe to discover that her mother, who has learned of the affair, has committed suicide. She violently shakes it, which causes it to fall on her. Su-yeon returns to the mental health clinic where she was before the movie started. The real Eun-joo, who expresses concern for her, promises to visit whenever she can.Imagine a \"boo\" moment from a teenage horror flick. Ji-woon extends the sensation of a \"boo\" moment for several minutes. A needle slowly penetrates your skin, slipping past pain receiver cells, and you look down and realize how uncomfortable your situation is. That realization is devastatingly terrifying. Being seduced by the needle's lack of pain, then acknowledging its control over you is how this film frightens its audience. You are lead innocuously down a well-lighted path with close ups. Gradually, the lights dim and something happens. Some scares are repetitive, admittedly. Nevertheless, the dinner party occurrence is brilliant. It's such a treat for repeat viewers. A real foreshadowing there! Norman Bates convinced himself that Mother was alive so he acted on her behalf. Su-mi is slightly less delusional. I think she knows her sister is dead and feels impending guilt over her inability to prevent it. Or maybe she wants to frame Eun-joo. We never find out which. The only certainty is Moo-hyeon, whose actions are always real. We don't have confidence in that observation until the very end. A Tale of Two Sisters is a rare horror film that is directed for intellectuals. It begs to be analyzed and discussed in psychology classrooms.'\n",

            "Review: 'Before I pessimistically review A Tale of Two Sisters, or even start talking about the predictability of the horror genre, let me start by saying this. Have you ever watched a comedy and thought \"Hmm, that was pretty clever, I guess . . .\" after a joke, but didn't laugh? The reason so many comedies simply aren't laugh-out-loud funny anymore is because they just repeat the same jokes over and over again. You may have not heard that EXACT joke before, but you've likely heard a thousand others that deal with the same subject matter and have a similar punch line. Likewise, that's also the problem with A Tale of Two Sisters, with a horror plot rather than a joke. After it was over I thought \"Hmm, that was pretty clever, I guess . . .\" but more than that I was just thinking how utterly dull it was. You see, A Tale of Two Sisters has a clever ghost story plot that I've personally never seen done before, but I've seen hundreds of other movies with plots almost EXACTLY like it. It had very little creativity, and absolutely zero originality.There are a lot of major problem with the statement that horror fans everywhere seem to be agreeing on: \"Asians are the only people making real horror movies.\"Here are some. (1) Asian horror cinema, with the exception of maybe Ringu, has never once made a horror movie as creative or well-done as American horror like The Shining and Alien. (2) Asian horror cinema has never once made a movie as gory as American mainstream releases, such as the Saw series. And yes, I've seen Ichi the Killer and all the other supposed \"gory\" Asian movies. Simply put, the camera is always staring at the wall while gore happens somewhere else. Gory? Are you joking? (3) Asian horror mainly just repeats the same plots over and over again, never once using any kind of originality or diversity. Example: Mirrors, Ringu, and The Eye all follow the same exact plot. (4) A lot of Asian horror rips-off American horror. Example: Dark Water is pretty much The Shining . . . with water. (5) The majority of Asian horror isn't really horror at all, but drama. (6) I could go on for another page listing things, but do I need to? A lot of horror fans are catching on by calling most Asian \"horror\" not horror at all.A Tale of Two Sisters falls into every one of those categories other Asian horror movies have created. Why couldn't the movie just be as good as the poster?Bad:(1) Slow, boring, and then tries to hold your interest by using clichés (such as the bag scene in the end). (2) Characterization, to be blunt, doesn't even exist. (3) The entire story has a \"I've seen this a thousand times!\" feel. (4) Clichés around every corner (such as the asylum opening, and the under-the-sink scene). (5) In the end, some of the over-the-top acting from the adults adds a thin layer of cheese. (6) The \"intelligent\" thinkers will love this movie because it has the trite, cliché psychological structure that is used in every movie just like this. (7) As I've said four times now, the entire movie is completely devoid of anything even remotely original or different from the Asian norm or the ghost story norm in general. (8) There is little, if anything, scary about this movie. It's drama.Good:(1) The cinematography and production values are both beautiful and crisp. (2) It understands childhood fear, and presents it well to the audience. (3) The two bed scares near the beginning are very, very well-done. (4) The young girls play their parts very well.But overall, A Tale of Two Sisters is only half the masterpiece everyone seems to think it is. It is essentially the Asian copy of The Sixth Sense, in terms of quality and overall structure, and they would be about on par with each other if it didn't feel like A Tale of Two Sisters was just trying to redo it with Asian style. But both are just average-at-best ghost stories. It's sad to see so many people mindlessly praise a movie because of the style and not the story.Let me put it this way: if A Tale of Two Sisters didn't have the production value and nice directing it did, it would be on par with The Haunting of Molly Hartley and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Just laughable. 1/10'\n",

            "Review: 'Many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years. I was inclined to agree with this until the influx of Asian horror films, a trend which has admittedly grown dull. However, it has produced some true classics, and A Tale Of Two Sisters, for me at least, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time.Based vaguely on a Korean folktale, it tells the sad story of two mentally-troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother. After experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home, they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. The tension rises and there is the inevitable snap. But what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the scares become more emotional and quite real. By the end, you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind, but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to watch again and again, if only to work it all out.'\n",

Make no mistake though, to fully appreciate this gem will take considerable effort and concentration on the part of the viewer and the 'all your questions answered' threads on the message boards of this site help a great deal.I think this film is best classified as a psychological horror, although it has more than a few truly terrifying moments, certainly enough to keep a horror fan satisfied. There is one moment in particular towards the start of the film that scared me more than any other film since I stayed up late to watch John Carpenters 'The Thing' in an empty house when I was about 13! The minimal score really helps here and as other members have commented the total lack of music during the scares is a refreshing and nerve jangling change.I will refrain from mentioning the plot in any significant capacity as there really is too much to say. I would certainly recommend watching this film a number of times to get the best out of it though - there is just so much to take in and savour.I highly recommend this film as it absolutely blows any modern 'horror' film that I have seen out of the water.

            "Review: 'This Korean movie is one of the roughest and most mind blowing flicks I have ever seen. It's complex and twisted with and plays a lot with illusions. Lynch and Cronenberg seem to be easy entertainment compared to this brilliant plot. This masterpiece absolutely requests multiple viewings if you are not just frustrated or angry after the first try and feel to throw the whole movie away. There is no path in between this extreme movie, you adore or hate this flick. Sometime sit can happen that you severely hate it in the beginning but you can't get away from that flick with that degree of in-satisfaction so that you try it out again and start to like it entirely in the end.The particular problem is that all the twists, surprises and revelations are in the last thirty minutes or so of the movie. The amount of details is just too high and at first try you will get completely dumped and lost but that was the intentions of the makers. You really don't see this ending coming as the movie starts like an intriguing and dramatic suspense flick playing in an eerie and haunted house. I felt that the first two thirds of the movie showed us nothing new in the genre of haunted mansions but I still really adored it because of the authentic and intense acting of every single character and a very dark atmosphere that sent some shivers down my spine. All of this is nothing compared to the last third that feels like if you were inside a storm and intense spiral of mental illness. This movie is hard to digest and difficult to appreciate and almost impossible to get fully understood. In the end, you realize that this movie is way more than just a movie about a haunted house. It can be interpreted as a horror movie, as a psychological suspense or as a tragic drama and depending on the attitude and focus of the audition, the movie may completely change its character, its soul. This flick is rich of details and interpretations. It's like a labyrinth that leads to several and very different exits but where you could also get lost forever. I cut off one point from a very subjective point of view as this movie was really hard to watch and appreciate and cost me a lot of time to get familiar with it. I highly recommend the board discussions of this movie but suggest you to watch this movie several times all alone before looking for further interpretations and discussions with the experts that have seen this movie ten times or more.I warn you! This intellectual movie is hard to digest. If you want to see an entertaining horror movie playing in an eerie mansion, go for \"The Amityville Horror\", \"The orphanage\" or \"Rose Red\". This movie will break your head like if it was a nut. It's absolutely anti mainstream, weird and unique and will haunt you for hours and days if you are willing to get into it. The movie demands your participation, you can't simply just watch it in order to get entertained. You must play the detective, analyze the scenes, spin backwards and forwards after a first coherent try. Even for experts and fans of Asian cinema like me, this is hard stuff. Nevertheless, this movie should get further attention as it is a unique masterpiece that can't and hopefully won't be remade. Congratulations to the genius that wrote the script and directed this weird stuff and to the amazing actors as well. This movie leads avantgarde cinema to a new level.'\n",

But if you still prefer profound stories, meaningful plots or even wisdomful twists of mind, then spare your two hours for something like that, i.e. not for this movie.So, why so much praise to it here on IMDb? Let's see... Moody atmosphere? Yes, checked. Nice music? At least it fits, checked. Brilliant acting? Sure, checked. Beautiful cinematography? No doubt, checked. Thorough directing? True, checked. Crappy screenplay? Absolutely! ...Oops!Now I'll explain you what they're selling you here under the cloak of masterpiece.HERE GO SPOILERS!The 'story' is filmed partly backwards, so we start from the end. The mom of two sisters committed suicide. Why? No answer. The younger girl 'saw' her in the closet with the rope around her neck. Why? No answer. Then this girl, affected, pulls and drops that closet on herself and starts to suffocate. The step-mom goes in, sees that but doesn't help. Why? No answer. Oh, wait! She hates those girls - that's why she doesn't help. Really? Or maybe those girls (particularly the elder) hated her and made her life a nightmare? And that's why she preferred that crime of omission? We never know. So, no answer. The elder girl goes mad, literally, and strikes the nuthouse. Probably after discovering her loved sister dead. Or maybe she was also so affected by the mother's death. Or maybe she was into it \"from the very beginning\". They don't tell us. No answer. Although the doctor releases her home after a while, she return to parents' house together with her imaginary sister. And that's where fun (sorry, the movie) begins. Craving for revenge (or being victimized by the step mother - choose by yourself) she clashes with that woman on every occasion. To the highest point. All through those two hours. Veeery slooowly. After the final encounter she gets back to the mental facility while the step-mother licks her wounds. What's next? Nothing. The end of the story, actually. So, what's the point of this all? There's no any. You don't believe me? Okay, watch the movie, see for yourself :)You may notice, I omitted other characters. No worries, they are nothing more than furniture. And finally, you may ask me what's the use of all those dead girls under the kitchen sinks, rotten flesh and bleeding sacks, and other skeletons (pardonnez-moi, moms actually) in the closets here? Well, otherwise it wouldn't be a horror film! That's obvious, Watson!'\n",

            "Review: 'Disgused as an Asian Horror, \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" is actually a complex character driven psychological drama, that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares, has proved a correct one. Creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies.\"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" tels the story, as it's name suggest of two sisters Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon, who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother. From then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmother's gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior. To say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience. So I'll just leave it at that.The plot is very tightly written. With the characters nicely fleshed out. Ji-woon Kim's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another. Furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character. From the protective Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the visibly uninterested father to the stepmother's frantic and later deadly behavior. There is great sense of mystery, with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation. Even after watching it once, the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it.The actors superbly fit their roles. It is especially hard to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat. Ji-woon Kim's direction is slow paced and gripping, building up tension for the film's horroresque scenes. While few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying. The cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film.\"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride. With it's strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better.'\n",

            "Review: 'Some may categorise this movie as a horror movie. By the time the puzzle was mostly solved and the movie was almost over, I would have said that it's a psycho thriller. However after digesting the movie it's clearly a drama that uses the tools of thriller and horror to tell the tale of a family burdened with a huge trauma. More specifically, it's about how this trauma looks like for our protagonist, and what the consequences are for her.The film was made meticulously. It uses a vast array of tools to unfold this drama and to immerse the audience into the experience and mental state of the protagonist. Cinematography, set designs, the use of colours, sound score -- all work in concert. The acting and directing is first class. The pacing is excellent and the script is great. Nothing happens by chance. The movie doesn't build up to hit you with jump-scares. What happens on the canvas is always meaningful and is used to depict the mental state of the traumatised family members or to steadily unfold the mystery.The aim of this movie is not to scare the living daylights out of its audience. The aim is to let you experience the tragedy. There are no evil people or monsters here and no flawless heroes either. At the end of the movie you'll feel various degrees of sympathy towards all major characters impacted by this trauma and feel sorry for them.However if your main goal is to watch a truly solid thriller and feel the chills down your spine, this movie fits that bill also quite well.P. S.: I'm not too familiar with South-East Asian movies and it's always nice to explore a little bit of the culture of South-East Asian nations. For me it was refreshing to see this drama expressed using the South-Korean cinematic language. I feel happy that I decided to watch this movie, it was time well spent indeed.'\n",

            "Review: 'I agree with a previous poster on the subject of this film. It should be seen more than once.Soo-mi and her sister Soo-yeon have returned to their home with their father after being released from a mental institution for undisclosed reasons. Their stepmother, Eun-joo, is less than thrilled by their return and her verbal abuse begins almost immediately. Soo-yeon, the timid sister, is frightened by the noises she hears within the house and by a large wooden wardrobe in her bedroom, which holds the key to a traumatic event in her past. Soo-mi, who is fiercely protective of her sister, is having nightmares, and begins seeing the stark figure of a white-faced, wide-eyed ghost girl creeping with eerie jerkiness through her room. Their father, a distant and somewhat cold man, makes a few half-hearted attempts to talk to Soo-mi, who wants nothing to do with him. Signs of physical abuse begin to show up on Soo-yeon, and Soo-mi suspects their stepmother, Eun-joo. Eun-joo herself is clearly not stable, and her mental state becomes more fractured as the days pass. Finally, tensions explode one night when Eun-joo viciously attacks Soo-yeon. The dark secrets of the past are finally revealed and Soo-mi comes face to face with the truth she has not been able to face before. But not even the revelation of the truth can put an end to things. The dead will still have their revenge upon the living.A lot of people are going to be terribly confused by this film, even after everything is laid out and explained in the films final moments. It does indeed need to be watched more than once, as key pieces of dialog suddenly reveal themselves to be much more significant than previously thought, and actions once confusing suddenly make more sense. I can't go into too much detail without totally ruining the plot, so just consider yourselves warned: be prepared to watch this again immediately after your first viewing has ended.That said, this is a beautiful film to watch and admire, filled with autumnal images and moments of true creepiness, most of which involve the appearance of the Ringu-like ghost girl. The myriad emotions and violent mood swings are exhausting, and sometimes downright uncomfortable to watch, and all the more admirable for those very reasons. Fans of films like \"Memento Mori\" and \"Phone\" will probably enjoy this one as well.'\n",

            "Review: 'Described as the 'most frightening film since Ring' and a mix of psychological horror, ghost story and drama, A Tale of Two Sisters is a truly complex film with great depth, good performances, technological perfection, and a few scares. In truth it is vastly different from Ringu, but naturally with every Asian Horror movie featuring a long-haired, scary looking girl comparisons will be made. True, Ringu is the master, but this is of an entirely different breed. If you are a fan of Ringu, Asian horror movies in general then this is definitely one to see before the Hollywood remake, but be warned- it is difficult the first time round, and will likely not be what you expected.The film begins in a psychiatric hospital, a doctor tries to get a young girl, Soo-Yeun to explain what has happened in her past. We then apparently flash back and meet two sisters, Soo-yeun and Soo-mi, their father and step-mum. The sisters are very close, but they have no respect for their father, and hate their step-mum. We do not know why. Soo-mi is quieter, Soo-yeun is protective of her and will not let any harm come to her. They have returned from a mental hospital but we do not know why. There is a coldness in the house, and a lack of understanding. The father seems passive, unable to understand his kids or relate to his partner, while the step-mum is very strange, ranging from cruel to hysterically happy. Soon strange things begin to happen in the house, noises, frightening ghosts appear, or perhaps they are hallucinations. The whole house is affected, but we do not know if it an evil power in the house, the threatening demeanour of the step-mum, or if it is all just a mirage. The parents cannot stand the behaviour of the kids anymore, and a confrontation ensues where we finally learn the startling, emotional truth.For the majority of the film, the viewer will have little idea as to what is going on. Unfortunately this does not always work for the best- true the plot keeps us guessing, but there are perhaps too many twists to confuse us. This is deliberate of course, and we get a true sense of the madness which can come from guilt and anger, although it may be too overwhelming for some. This is a pity as it is a very good film, and must be watched right to the end before any questions are really answered. However, if you enjoy many twists and being kept in a loop then few films are better than this. Admittedly some, including myself will be taken in by the tag-line, by other reviews, and will expect another terrifying time. However, the scary Ringu/Ju-on style scares are few, and the distance between them is long, ensuring frustration for those who want to be scared. When they come though they are intense, and will get the hairs on your arms reaching for the sky. Those are the only complaints I can have with the film, and for a fan of clever films they are minor.The film's depth is unquestionable, amazing when considering it was based on a simple, popular Korean folk tale. We do not know what will happen next, or why, and we are left thinking about it for a long time after it is over. Luckily the DVD has much explanatory documentaries and interviews which will help. The music is extremely good, mixing the noises which worked to such great effect in Ringu, with touching string numbers to add to the emotional impact. The camera-work is breathtaking, with many innovative angles which will have you on edge, and the tension created is admirable. The editing is deserving of much respect as we get many quick flashbacks, false ones and true ones to past events which may or may not have happened in the way they are shown. The film looked beautiful, and the scenery is haunting. Lastly, the performances by the small cast are each excellent. Geon-yeung Mun is impressive as Soo-yeon, painfully showing the madness she feels. Kap-su Kim as the father is vacant and cold, seems to have lost any emotions he once had, and tired by all around him. Su-jeong Lim as Soo-mi is very sympathetic, and although she has little to say, conveys everything with her eyes well. The stand-out though is Jung-ah Yum as the step-mum, her wildly changing face and actions are astounding and she is genuinely creepy. We are never certain of how she will act, but know that every second she is on screen is a marvel. To summarise, definitely see this if you are a fan of Asain movies as it is a masterpiece of depth and direction, but there are more immediately scary films out there in the same vein. This will have a lasting effect on you though. This is near perfect thriller, and an above average horror.7.5 out of 10. 8.5 if you enjoy the complexities.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'm not entirely satisfied with this horror film, but it certainly has its moments. Actually, it is the horror aspect that doesn't work entirely. It comes off as too much like the recent strain of horror films from Japan like The Ring, and even like some American movies, like The Others and The Sixth Sense. In fact, in a lot of its most horrific moments, the direction is rather mediocre, relying on very cheap horror tricks like stings in the music. The rest of the film-making is really good, fortunately. The film really redeems itself in that final sequence, where the film sorts out its twists. It throws the shadow of an effective drama over the rest of the film. I'd love to see the story reconstructed with some of the weaker horror moments eliminated. Su-jeong Lim is brilliant in the film. And I love that maudlin theme music.'\n",

You literally have to watch this film more than once in order to put all the pieces together because it is like one big puzzle the audience has to figure out slowly and methodically and even in the last few shots details are being revealed to you that will surprise you.As our teachers used to tell us in class when we were kids; \"put your thinking caps on for this one!\" If you get up for three minutes to get a drink while this movie is on you will miss essential plot points.All the acting is superb, especially by newcomer Su-jeong Lim playing the older sister (who was outstanding in the addictive Korean TV series I'm Sorry, I Love You, filmed the following year and the biggest TV hit series in all Asia, a lot of that having to do with her fine acting skills).The location for A Tale of Two Sisters is haunting; isolated and beautiful. The music is breathtaking! I also recommend getting the Extras disc in the two disc set and watching it. You will learn even more about the making of this film by listening to those people, stars, director, composer, etc. who were involved in creating it.I have seen the new American version of this film that came out this year and it pales in comparison to this masterpiece. I would strongly suggest you rent A Tale of Two Sisters from Netflix or buy it for your library and watch it BEFORE you watch the American version, which has far lower scores on the IMDb, for good reason.'\n",

            "Review: '\"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" (ridiculously titled \"The Possessed Ones\" in Mèxico) may not have a sinister atmosphere, or it may not be a creepy movie, but it surely is a deep, emotional Horror-Drama. Sure, there are creepy scenes involving ghosts, but that's not what this movie is all about. If you enjoy the popular Japanesse CGI ghost flicks, you may not dig this one. This movie provoked me a reaction that only a few other movies have caused: it showed me that everything I knew about the movie because of what I understood to some point was not right. It made me think all over about all the suspicious scenes that led me to reach a conclusion. I won't give away the explanation (in my opinion) towards the most important situation of the movie. All I can say that this movie will move your feelings and will make you feel Soo-mi's pain and confusion. Join Soo-mi in this Horror Drama that will make you think. I felt sympathy, pain, sadness, for our main character and her family. Now, this is real Horror... a movie that can actually scare you without showing graphic death scenes, gore, or CGI. The acting is simply great. Su-jeon Lim delivers a solid performance that makes you wanna help her. Her performance is very deep and may be the second best feature about the movie. She portrayed perfectly the strong sister who would support her sister in any situation. Geun-yeong Mun (Soo-yeon) is amazing in her role. She portrays a tender, kind, ingénue girl who isn't strong enough to face traumatic situations. Kap-su Kim (the father) also delivers an emotional performance as the kind parent who is severely affected because of his daughter's disease. Jung-ah Yum (Eun-joo) is also perfect in her role. She's a villain in her own way but she also portrays a strong woman in a difficult situation.Apart from the \"scary\" situations (as when Soo-yeon \"possesses\" the brother's wife) this is a mind blowing movie that will make you think. This is a clever, brave, and emotional Horror movie that will stay in your mind for a long time. Do yourself a favor a buy/rent, watch \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\", a movie for people that like to think and not just be entertained.'\n",

            "Review: 'Drama/mystery film from Korea. Another excellent example of Korean cinema that teaches seriousness and morals. It's a mostly dramatic film, but it's also a mystery and a bit of a thriller from some point on, and as a drama it's pretty slow. Very good performances each in the role given to them, very good directing and interesting script with many big twists. The film has to come to an end for the viewer to understand what was going on, what the truth and mystery of the whole film is, as well as the murders. It unfortunately loses at its very sluggish pace, but it is quite a serious film in contrast to the immoralities of its American remake, The Uninvited (2009). It is recommended as dramatic mainly because of its low pace and not as a thriller.'\n",

One of the most complex plots ever paired with outstanding sound effects, suspense and thrill makes this movie a definite must watch for everyone.While watching the film you pick up on some details and start to form your opinion about how it is going to continue/end, this movie absolutely shatters your expectations to pieces at many points in the film. I can bet you, if this is your first time watching there is 0% chance you will understand what is actually happening in the film. Definitely one of those movies, that leaves people brainstorming after it ends. I believe people still have not come to a final thorough explanation of the story to this day. There are many explanations, but the actual plot is very open to discussion even now, 14 years later, that is one of the greatest achievements of film making you can wish for.The acting is also impeccable, the actors are unknown to western audiences, but by no means is that a minus here, the actors are playing their roles superbly. The movie has one of the most amazing sound effects/jump scares i have ever seen in a psychological thriller. Even if you do not enjoy horror films, watch this regardless, since it is not at all about horror or lots of scary monsters, it is the insanely complex plot twists and interesting story that put this movie on the map. A must watch!!!'\n",

Words cannot describe how flipping perfect this film is. I'm not even going to detail the plot, just take my advice and watch it immediately. As I was entranced I kept thinking \"...this all seems too familiar...\", then it clicked. Hollywood remade this with a film called The Uninvited (underrated but inferior nonetheless). Interestingly that film only used one plot twist and is not half as creepy. I've never felt so terrified in all my life. Something about Asian ghost girls just...gives me nightmares. Two scenes in particular: one involves one of the sisters dreaming where a woman is clawing at the floor beside her bed and the other is towards the end and is set in a freezing room. Holy sweet mother of...*ahem* it physically made me hide behind a cushion. That's never happened to me before. Asian horror films are miles ahead of Hollywood. Kim Jee-Woon was stylish and made the tale extremely visual as opposed to masses of dialogue. The slow camera movements when scenes start to edge towards the horror direction and having every character move slower than paint drying, incredibly effective and unnerving. Not one, not two, but three \"Oh My God!\" moments where I literally flipped out in awe and excitement. Carefully constructed characters and a palpable sisterly bond between Su-Mi and Su-Yeon. Acting was incredible all round. The musical score was appropriately used, upbeat in the more cheerful moments and muted in the tense scenes. You think your step-mother was scary and/or evil? You've seen nothing yet. This woman is the definition of ominous, mental and most definitely haunting. In fact the whole experience was haunting and I cannot wait to watch it again. Easily, without a doubt, A Tale of Two Sisters gets the perfect rating. Definitely experience this, then give The Uninvited a watch and compare.'\n",

            "Review: 'I might have been slightly disappointed with A Tale Of Two Sisters as I was expecting a horror flick, maybe something about the stepmother going insane and killing the sisters. What I got was an almost two hour long film with an ending almost impossible to predict. While I liked the twist, there wasn't an amazing buildup. It felt quite clear that someone was dead or nonexistent, the plot twist was finding out who it was. If you look at The Sixth Sense, what makes the twist so good it that it's realistic and makes sense, but also because it's predictable. It makes you want to go through the entire movie again to look for all the clues. With ATOTS there are no clues to tell you about Su-mis DID or that she is impersonating the stepmother. There's also the ghost woman who I assume is the mother as she has long hair (and is dead) but while we see the ghost we have no idea who the mother is or what she looks like, making it impossible to predict the ending. There are also scenes where Su-yeon (the dead girl) is alone but we still se her experiencing things like a normal person, which is a really dumb way to try and make the audience think that she's not dead, as well as make scenes where she interacts with the stepmom/older sister on her own, like when she is locked in the wardrobe. This also, by the end of the movie, ends up feeling like a cheap way of covering up the fact she's dead.I don't think this movie was complete trash, however and it did have some good aspects story-wise. I liked that there was more than one twist and that you really had to watch til the very end to understand it. It wasn't just \"Boom! The younger sister was dead all along! End\" there was more to it. I genuinely enjoyed it and many times it had me on the edge of my seat. I just think it could have been put together a little better, and a lot of scenes felt unnecessary and like they were just dragging the film out needlessly.Besides all this, I've read some of the 1-star reviews and a lot of them are just.... stupid. I also tend to dislike pretentious artsy films, and this was a bit pretentious, but it was still a good movie. I know a lot of people were unsatisfied with it considering how long it was and how little happened. But you should have considered the fact that this isn't really a horror film. There is a long buildup because there is so much more to the characters and the family than you think. As I said in the beginning of this review, I expected this to be a more classic horror, but it wasn't, which was the main reason for my disappointment. But I don't think it's fair to rate this genuinely good movie low because \"it's not what you were expecting\". If you want something predictable without long scenes go watch a slasher.'\n",

            "Review: 'A Tale of Two Sisters is an immense psychological thriller that delves deep into the horrors of family dysfunction through the loss of a loved one and the gaining of another and the conflict of personalities that can no longer hold back their anger, their guilt and their passion. Ji-woon Kim, both director and writer of the screenplay, has used the old Korean folktale of the killing of two young sisters by their stepmother, and reworked it as his own.He has given the viewer a bouquet of thoughts, with which we have to tender them to our own personal needs, and through this, we come to our own conclusions of Life, Death and the seemingly unfair World that we all take part in. He has made this World very dark and bleak, too dark for any flower to grow and spread it seeds, to confined for petals to blow freely in the winds of Life, this shadowy and windless environment only delivers a short, wilted and impotent Life.A Tale of Two Sisters stars two of Korea's youngest leading ladies, Su-jeong Lim as Bae Soo-mi (Janghwa) and Geun-yeong Mun as Bae Soo-yeon (Hongryeon). With acting abilities to render any passing bee helpless in their quest for the search for pollen, these young actresses will flower into greater talent. (Having the added bonus of watching this movie for the first time, today of all days, as it is Geun-yeong Mun's 19th birthday also, is a twist of fate that is beyond creepy).With an array of Awards to its name, such as Jung-ah Yum winning the Silver Raven Award during 2002, for her Acting, as well as Su-jeong Lim winning Best Actress in 2004. Ji-woon Kim gaining eight Awards from around the Globe for his talents on A Tale of Two Sisters, this has proved, without doubt, that this little South Korean movie has blossomed into the minds of a wider audience.The pace and delicate timing of this movie is what makes it so nightmarishly realistic, with the atmospheric and haunting overtones, to the music and the use of both dark and colour that illuminate the unstable mind and its vulnerability to tip over the precipice and into the abyss of madness that brings the senses to horrific consequence. This is a movie of madness, the worst kind of madness, that when those closer to us have turned against us, then there really are no other alternatives left in this world.The Horror, both physical and mental, has begun in earnest.'\n",

            "Review: 'A Tale of Two Sisters is one of the best films I have seen in many years. I had heard some fairly good reviews, but I was not prepared for just how spectacular and original this film turned out to be.I will not try to make comparisons as this is a film that defies classification, however, it should be said this is no standard horror film, in fact it is probably better described as Psychological thriller than a horror film. It does however hold appeal to fans of the horror, thriller or even straight drama genres, as this film is so sublime, intelligent, subtle, dramatic, and even scary that anyone with an open mind should find something to enjoy in it.The acting is excellent, the cinematography is breathe-taking, the direction is spectacular, everything about this movie is at the highest end of the quality scale. But the true star of the film is the story. This is a fantastic and original script, that is at once complex and simple, you just have to wait for the final twist/reveal to fully understand just how simple and complex this film is.I hate spoilers and you won't get one here, but I can say that like the better twist films out there (think Fight Club or Sixth Sense) this film gets better with repeat viewing. Once you have seen this once you will be rushing back to see how it all held together. And it really holds up! Unlike many genre films, A Tale of Two Sisters relies more on great writing, directing and visual style to generate it's creepy atmosphere and scares, rather than cheap shock tactics or flashy editing. Having said that, there are a few great shocks and the editing is fantastic. In fact I don't think I have seen another Asian film that is as technically brilliant as this film.I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, but be warned, it is rumoured that Hollywood is well on the way to remaking this, so get out and see the original while you have a chance, because this film will be very difficult to transfer successfully to a western setting. The Korean culture, aesthetic, style and presence is what make this film so special.'\n",

The movie opens in a mental hospital where a teenage girl called Su-Mi is suffering from shock and psychosis. She is being questioned by a doctor who shows her pictures of her family and asks if she can speak about the day that led her to being admitted to the hospital. Next she returns with her father and sister,Su-Yeon, to the family's estate near a lake. The two sisters are reluctant to go inside the house where their stepmother is waiting for them. So they go down to a pier by the lake where they relax by putting their feet in the water and enjoy the sun. They are called back to the house where they are greeted by the stepmother . She tells them off them for making her wait and taunts them by asking if they are feeling better after having been away. But the sisters will not respond to her.t a family dinner, the stepmother announces she has invited the sister's uncle and his wife to dinner the next day. Su-Mi tells her stepmother she will not eat with them and the two sisters leave the table. Su-Mi tells Su-Yeon that if their stepmother ever goes after Su-Yeon to let her know. That night as Su-Yeon goes to sleep, she hears noises and the door to her bedroom creakily opens and a female hand sneaks around it. Su-Yeon pulls the covers over her head only to have them pulled back by an unseen force. Terrified, she runs out of her room to Su-Mi and tells her that someone has come into her room.

A lot of what makes this one quite chilling is the professionalism and competency displayed for so many of the technical areas here. There's a really strong and palpable sense of class afforded to the film by its leisurely pace and reliance on atmosphere to build it's mood, meaning that the film takes itself seriously while generating the kind of feeling that echoes classic ghost stories. From the impending dread over the different storylines present, as in the reconfirming of their relationship, each girls' relationship to the father and stepmother and then the underlying ghost presence popping up from time-to-time to remind us it's a horror film, to the outstanding and nearly flawless presentation of such material all come together to give this a strong impression. That build-up in terms means that once it does bring those horror elements into play, it's exceptionally creepy and enjoyable. By going with a stronger and more focused setup involving the relationship between the girls and the new stepmother including her treatment towards them as well as the rather fine mystery about her history with the family, there's a rather fine backdrop to hang the hauntings on which makes them score nicely. From the initial appearance in the bedroom that freaks her out to the point of sleeping with the sister to the sighting under the table at the dinner party and the scores of intimidation tactics performed here not only by the ghost but also the later half where it brings out far more intensive and thrilling ghost encounters which are really thrilling and exciting. As these, in turn, lead into the stellar twist involved here it's quite fun and really manages to score nicely here. Coupled with the fine ghost makeup on the truly terrifying creatures shown, these are what hold this up over it's few minor negative issues. About the only real flaw to this one is it's somewhat glacial pacing that can be maddening at times. This one doesn't really generate any kind of traditional pacing towards its ghost scenes and really takes it's time building up the atmosphere without really paying them off which can make this feel like nothing much is happening. Likewise, the fact that there's not a whole lot of straightforward coherence to its storyline which can be somewhat frustrating for some who want a little more than what is generally given here. However, these aren't detrimental and don't really hold it down that much.Rated Unrated/R: Violence and Language.'\n",

A Tale of Two Sisters is an fine example of this, working well as a horror and thriller, with great twist that you won't see coming.This film tells the story of Su-Mi (Im Soo Jung) and Su-Yeon (Moon Geun Young), two sisters who have just returned home after being in a psychiatric ward after the death of their mother. They have to live with a distant father and a bitchy step-mum, who abuses Su-Yeon, the timid one of the sisters. Both sisters are very close, and Su-Mi looks out for her younger sister. On their first night back strangle thing happen in the house, hearing footsteps in the middle of the night, doors opening by themselves and both sisters suffer from seeing images. It is something to do with their step mum, is it something supernatural or are they just going insane.Hollywood really don't know how to make good horror films; they just focus on violence and death and that's what turns me off the genre. Directors, writers and producers really need to watch a film like this to understand how to make a good horror film. Like any good film, the best horrors focus on two things, character and ideas. Within A Tale of Two Sisters you care for the two main characters who are very well developed and you care about what happens to them. Some horrors also take away the mystery by relieving too much, thereby taking away the scare and suspense. The writer/director Kim Ji-woon keeps the mystery, so you don't know what's going to happen. He understands the genre. He made a complex film with plenty of twists. He is a man who knows his craft and this is the first film I saw of his.The acting is excellent, especially from Im Soo Jung and Moon Geun Young.

            "Review: 'Asian horror films are infamous for being just that, horrific. These films love to terrify us to no end with unrelenting frights and suspense. A Tale of Two Sisters is no different. It's a spine tingling story about two sisters who move into a country house with their father and stepmother. They don't cope well with their new environment as strange and terrifying things being to happen. They see ghosts and heard haunting noises throughout the house, with no explanation as to why any of this is happening. It's a terribly frightening story that is also very high quality and very compelling. It's chilling demonstration of what Asian cinema is capable of when it comes to horror flicks with its no holds bars attitude and it endless plight to scare the living daylights out of its audience one chilling creak at a time.I won't hesitate to call this one of the scariest films I've seen in my lifetime. I'm not talking about disgusting, shocking, or horrific. I'm talking truly scary. This film goes above and beyond to make itself as suspenseful as possible. It is loaded with those awful moments when you know something terrible is about to happen, but you don't know exactly when so you can only sit there and wait in sickening anxiety. A Tale of Two Sisters embraces the anticipation factor when constructing its chills and thrills, and I hate/love it for doing so. But even if you subtract all of the film's jump scares, it is still incredibly frightening. The twisted, evil, grotesque plot is so chilling and so unsettling that there isn't a moment in this film that we can feel comfortable and safe. It doesn't take long for the thrills to get rolling in this film, and once they start we can never be at ease.Yet while we squirm around and hide our face under the covers, the film also manages to be truly compelling and even sentimental. It's a heartbreaking film that spends its time scaring us, but knows when to take a break from that to provide compelling sentiment and a gripping plot. It beautifully weaves in a strong plot with terrifying thrills and a haunting visual style. This film puts on a front of being jumpy, edgy, and sporadic, yet running underneath is a style full of grace and a story wrought with emotion. This is a technique lost within most American horror because they only look to terrify through the cheap thrills. A film like A Tale of Two Sisters provides a convincing and compelling plot with gripping emotional value. This, in effect, makes it a scarier film because we believe it. The human realism that courses through the film's veins drags us into this film's terrifying story and makes us believe in everything we are witnessing for its two hour duration. I don't know why so many horror films don't pick up on this, because it is terribly convincing and makes a film all the more terrifying.I always enjoy finding a piece of truly good modern horror, what with all the crap that rears its ugly head on the market nowadays. A Tale of Two Sisters doesn't restore my faith in American horror, but it certainly lets me know which way to turn my attention towards if I want to find some truly compelling modern horror films. This film works incredibly well as a horror film, but it even succeeds as a drama as well. It's an impressive feat that can't afford to go unnoticed in this day and age.'\n",

            "Review: 'I saw the English-language remake of this film titled \"The Uninvited\" back in 2009 and it's taken me all this time to get around to this bizarre South Korean chiller. I found \"The Uninvited\" to be a particularly surprising horror film with some great plot twists and incredible acting, but \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" meets and surpasses its remake in droves.The film focuses on two South Korean sisters, Su-mi and Su-yeon, who return home after an ambiguous stint in a mental hospital to their father and their new stepmother. Through a myriad of surreal sequences and disturbing incidents in the house, a greater picture emerges of the girls' past.Aesthetically speaking, \"A Tale...\" is more sophisticated, and the set decoration and in particular, the cinematography, is grade A. Wonderful use of camera movements to emphasize and accentuate key moments, and heaps of atmosphere. While \"A Tale...\" falls more under the psycho- thriller side of the horror spectrum, it does contain some disturbing and classic \"horror\" sequences and is overall a very dark film. As far as the acting goes, it is also extremely believable, and especially admirable for a genre film. The acting from the stepmother character as well as both of the girls was spectacular. The end of the film has been debated to death although there is a pretty consistent trail that explains what really was going on, but the surreal montage of the film's final scenes do give it a Rubik's cube effect. Really, there's not much wrong with this movie in a cinematic regard. It's a class act all around, and while I had a clearer vision of the plot twists due to having seen the remake, I was still tense and gripped by this movie and couldn't keep it out of my head. Definitely worth watching. 9/10.'\n",

However, for those of you who have never written a screenplay, anyone can present some creepy images and some plot twists along the way, but if the ending doesn't wrap it all up in a sensible way, then you haven't said anything. There's no theme in this movie. The emotional level is lost because you can never really determine what is going on. Not enough information is given for me to really care. Oh, I know there's a twist somewhere, I just don't care by the time I get to it, and it isn't that good anyway. This is highly stylized crap at its finest. I gave it 3/10 because it least it did have some scary moments. Can anyone write a story that has the great ending of something like the Sixth Sense with some scarier sets? That would be a movie I want to see. Can't wait to see the director of The Uninvited try and turn this into something more than an empty shell...'\n",

            "Review: 'Whilst A Tale of Two Sisters isn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping for, it shows off what makes Asian cinema so good. A Tale of Two Sisters has the power to linger in your mind a long time after the credits have rolled. Not least because the film becomes confusing beyond belief leaving me not knowing what the hell was going on throughout most of the second half. However, after reading a long post explanation on IMDb I can now appreciate just how intelligent, powerful and tragic this film is. Most viewers probably won't give the film a seconds thought, however it truly is worth it, in the same way that Mulholland Dr offers you a narrative puzzle, yet solving it allows you to appreciate the thought and care that has gone into the film. This is when film becomes art.One problem I had with A Tale of Two Sisters is that it dragged. Especially in the first half, which was very slow. However, I fear that I may only be saying this because the slow pace took me by surprise. Especially after seeing Kim Jee Woon's fast-paced masterpiece, I Saw the Devil before-hand. A Tale of Two Sisters takes a much lower gear, and I think I would've enjoyed it more if I had known that before. The slow pace is also a strength however, as the film builds up quite an oppressive atmosphere where something doesn't feel quite right. A lot of the film relies on atmosphere so if you're immune to that, then you might be bored to death!The film is beautiful to look at however, with some perfectly framed images and a perfect set design. The house looks eerily beautiful with its flowery wallpaper, however as things take a darker turn the house starts to appear more menacing and appears exactly like your classic haunted house. It's important to note that A Tale of Two Sisters isn't actually a ghost story. I mean, it does have incredibly creepy moments (ghost on the bed *shivers*) but the film puts intense drama first, which I liked, but perhaps some people wouldn't. I loved the whole tension between Su-mi and her evil step-mother, and the film is driven by this frosty relationship.The ending offers a revelation which left me as bewildered as the end on Mulholland Drive. However, just like Mulholland Drive there is a perfectly reasonable and highly intelligent explanation which I urge you to read if you're unsure. Now I can appreciate the incredible writing skills and just how powerful this film is. It demands a second viewing as you'll be able to see the film in a completely different light due to its complex multi-layered nature. It's, for me, what raised A Tale of Two Sisters to an atmospheric 8/10 to a 9/10 and makes it a film which I can't wait to see again.A Tale of Two Sisters is a very creepy film, which turns out to be something very sad and more intelligent than you could imagine. I can imagine that the remake (The Uninvited) would've completely butchered A Tale of Two Sisters by sucking out the atmosphere and making it more dumb like the Pulse remake (I've not seen the Pulse remake, I've seen enough from the trailer!) A Tale of Two Sisters is superior horror which battles a lot of themes and also has a lot of memorable characters. The film does drag in places, but that doesn't make it any less interesting. If you go in expecting a slow, psychological drama with a ghost or two then I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy it!'\n",

Almost immediately they start to suspect that their is something wrong in the house. \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" is an excellent horror film and another example of the fantastic recent efforts coming out of South Korea. It is also one of the more visually stunning horror movies in recent memory, with striking cinematography and masterful use of color. This is the key to its brilliance. It is often so visually captivating that you cannot look away from the screen or cover your eyes, regardless of how disturbing or upsetting the imagery may be.

I was underwhelmed because it came out around the time Asian horror, like Ringu/The Ring and Ju-on/The Grudge, was making a scene in the North American market, and ATOTS looked like a poor man's version of those movies. That's what I thought after first viewing; I was watching it passively, but I did have questions because it confused the heck out of me. After reading some analyses on the movie, I decided to give it another try, and it was unforgiving. It didn't let me sleep for...I'd say 2-7 nights. I have seen scary movies from all decades. You could give me a top 100 horror movie list, and I would most likely be able to check off 90% of what's listed. But out of everything I've seen, nothing has terrified me more than ATOTS. I guess it depends, too, on the viewer's overall mental state. If you're more on the neurotic side *points to self* there are aspects of this movie that you're going to relate to (i.e., guilt and regret) and that would also be the source of the terror. It's not going to jump at you, it's going to creep into your psyche and linger...like a ghost. The cinematography and score are the most memorable part about this movie. I would only need to imagine hearing those piano notes playing, and I would get chills down my spine. Hauntingly beautiful. As someone mentioned in their review, this movie is like poetry. It has many layers that you would need to dissect to be revealed upon multiple viewing. When you see the movie for what it was intended to be, and all its subtle details, that's when things gets real scary.'\n",

            "Review: 'Very difficult to fully grasp on the first viewing, A Tale of Two Sisters is a psychological horror from South Korea that generates a creepy ambiance right from its opening moments & is one of those features that get better after multiple viewings. The plot requires the attention of its viewers from start to finish & presents many symbolic references & visual motifs throughout its runtime that can easily go unnoticed.The film opens by introducing us to Su-Mi; a teenaged girl at a mental hospital. That scene is followed by Su-Mi coming back home with her father & sister where her overbearing stepmother is waiting. Soon we find out that something isn't right with the house and from then on, the film throws one twist after another until the third act where it finally reveals its secrets but in a manner that will require another view or two for some to fully decipher it.Director Kim Jee-woon has tackled a wide range of genres in his glorious career & has proved himself to be a versatile filmmaker who has the calibre to add his unique flair to any story. And that's what he does here by adding an emotional understudy to its horror story. Cinematography provides an eerie atmosphere to the whole film with brilliant use of lighting while editing uncovers its layering in a composed manner.On an overall scale, A Tale of Two Sisters is a tense & mind-twisting chiller that has many moments of nightmarish terror embedded in it & is at its most shocking when you eventually figure out the whole story. Although it isn't a film that every cinema lover is going to enjoy, not even a film that every horror fan will enjoy, it still would be most rewarding to those who like stepping up to the challenge a cinema poses by presenting itself like a puzzle. Watch it twice, at least.'\n",

The plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down. What follows after that is the movie. It is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years. Everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended. It is not a perfect film. The film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story, even more confused.(If you've read any number of other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere you'll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on) I'm not sure what I actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have.

            "Review: 'This movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. The horror of \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of CGI guts and gore; it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout. Best of all, the ending does not provide a clear answer, pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place.Do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins, and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately. This is not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular. \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end. Even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy-handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place. The movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. Some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this.The true fear of \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares; it is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film. It is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so-called 'Asian Horror' genre. Indeed, it would be a mistake to align \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" with films like \"Ringu\" and \"The Grudge\". This movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints, some requiring no suspension of credulity, others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly.Whichever way you choose to interpret this film, it is one that demands an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on Asian cinema or horror in general.'\n",

            "Review: 'I've finally seen my first South Korean movie, and that is \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" because of the rave reviews it was getting. I was also told it was a very scary movie, and I really enjoy a good horror. To say the least I am disappointed and found it very confusing and very boring.I'm afraid I will have to disagree with most people here calling this film a masterpiece; I wouldn't even call it a good film. This was my first time watching a South Korean movie. I generally don't have a problem with subtitles, but seeing as most of of this film is based on visuals, I don't think the subtitles were a hindrance to my understanding the film. What was a hindrance to understanding the film, was the meandering screenplay, which could not quite decide what it wanted to be; a horror; thriller; psychological drama or mystery? The story is very difficult to follow because of the numerous inconsistencies in plot, especially after the big reveal near the end. It's a lot like those films that suddenly become a dream of some character by the end, and all inconsistencies and illogicality's are therefore okay - because it's a DREAM.As with with quite a few people here, I too had to log on here immediately after watching the film, just to understand what it was all about. That is not a hallmark of good cinema, if people have to seek external sources outside of a film to understand it, or watch it again more attentively.I watched this very long and dragged out film, only to come out not knowing what it was about. The director, Ji-woon Kim knows how to create tension but does not know how to relieve tension, and does not know that tension should be punctuated periodically by non-tension, or viewers concentration begins to diminish and it becomes monotonous. Throughout this very long film the movie has the semblance of sadness, resent, darkness, impending doom and an emotional arc is in-absentia. From the very beginning the dark and gloomy atmosphere, obviously designed to unsettle the viewers, begins, for something as trivial as the young girl walking into her bedroom. Nothing happens, of course. So why the build up of tension? It would seem the director is trying to create an atmospheric horror, and horror, like comedy, is quite a difficult genre to do, because it's requires precise timing and a firm handle on creating tension and manipulating fear. There is only one scene in the entire film that was successful in doing that, and was just about the only scare I got and it was simply a hand appearing underneath a cupboard. If done properly, even something this small can scare. Otherwise, Ji-woon invariably fails in every scene. Ji-Woon's direction style generally lacks imagination and vision. He seems to have a very limited vocabulary of shots and over-uses them. There are too many lingering long and shallow focus shots and the camera is static most of the times. This just adds to the monotony of watching the film. The photography is perhaps one of the weakest aspects of this film(as opposed to those saying it's beautiful) it just doesn't enthral, excite or impress and seems pedestrian. Having said that the lighting during the family dinner scenes is exquisite; seems somewhat inspired by American beauty(also framed similarly)As my first ever South Korean movie this has been quite a disappointment. Hopefully, someone can recommend a good South Korean film that is idiosyncratic of Korean culture. A Tale Of Two sisters generally felt like an average good quality television horror movie, only in a different language.'\n",

Now let's begin the slaughter. Nothing here had a proper sense. Starting from the subtitling-massacre (someone already said it, but I repeat it, anyone able to read Spanish could know from the fifth minute who was dead and who wasn't) and finishing with the bag (WHAT, IN GOD'S NAME, WAS INSIDE THAT BAG? WHERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT?) I just couldn't make it. It did actually scare me, but just because I am *that* coward, and because the music is rather effective. Apparently a sister here was two (or three or four, who knows) people at the same time, and she was killing...the others (therefore, herself?oh my I'm lost). There was a bizarre stepmother who did not exist terrifying a little sister who did not exist either and a father that apparently did exist but who could not or wanted not to help any of them. There was also a freaky cupboard where one or two of the imaginary characters met their end (or all of them, what the hell), and the above mentioned bag, where they *also* were killed...yeah, it does not make sense at all.

Su-jeong Lim does well as the young woman who may be the catalyst for the scary events, but Jung-ah Yum is truly outstanding as the step-mother who may (or may not) be evil, misunderstood, or a victim. This is only for horror fans who have to see absolutely everything.'\n",

            "Review: 'A Tale of Two Sisters is one of the quintessential texts that make up the school of Asian psychological horror, which critics usually describe as quiet, cerebral, and artistically legitimate compared to the loud, visceral and trashy American horror genre. This is more than a bit of hogwash. Leaving aside the fact that Japan and Korea certainly have their share of bloody exploitation flicks, what makes A Tale of Two Sisters great isn't some kind of cold-blooded artistry in opposition to genre filmmaking. Rather, A Tale of Two Sisters is good because it understands what great American horror movies like The Exorcist also understand: that our everyday lives are the most horrific things of all.This is a film about the powerlessness of childhood, the sense of being batted around by forces beyond your control, constantly divided between the unreal and logical world of fantasy and the tangible but incomprehensible world of adults. (This last part is especially emphasized through a mid-film twist.) It draws on the terror of the house creaking at night, of your father being able to marry a woman who isn't your mother, and of the grotesque transformation of growing up.Plotwise, there isn't much new to anyone with a passing familiarity with horror, and even the twists feel familiar. But Jae-woon Kim's direction adds malice and malaise to a script that could easily fall into soapy domestic drama or dull psychoanalysis. There's a fairytale quality to A Tale of Two Sisters, wicked stepmother and all, but it's a gruesome medieval fairy tale. But in the end it's worth giving yourself over to, just to feel the terror of childhood again, and hopefully ward off any nostalgia.'\n",

            "Review: 'A Tale Of Two Sisters is the tale of sisters Su-mi and Su-yeon, who go back to live with their father after Su-mi has been released from a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, their stepmother, Eun-joo, doesn't seem too pleased to have the girls back, and she seems to be hell bent on making the girls lives a complete misery. Not only do the girls have to put up with their unloving stepmother, but there seems to be a strange entity within the house also, so the girls must stick together more than ever to try and overcome the goings on inside the house.I first saw A Tale OF Two Sisters back when it first came out in 2003 and I think I was taken in a wee bit by the hype at the time because I didn't enjoy it as much this 2nd time around. Usually it's the other way around. I do enjoy a decent Asian horror film, but this one just seemed to lack a certain something to make it that bit better for me.It's also a pretty slow going movie, as are a lot of Asian horror movies I've seen, and I usually don't mind that but this one just never really picked up all that much for me to really enjoy it. The story itself is a pretty good one, and there is a good wee twist about ¾ of the way through, so that, along with a couple of decent creepy moments, rescues the movie from being a complete washout.I found out a while ago that this is the original of the American remake, The Uninvited, and while this won't be popular amongst the haters of American remakes of Asian horror films, I have to say I preferred the remake. Something that doesn't tend to happen with me either as I find that the originals are usually more superior. Just not in this instance.Overall, this isn't too bad of a movie to watch, but just be prepared for a slow moving film that you may struggle to get into.'\n",

Why do they have to ruin everything? It's kinda depressing that everything these days is either recycled or stolen from some other source. We either have remakes or re-tellings or taking a TV show and making it into a film. It makes me very sad.

MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!The movie starts pretty simple - two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself. The sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the elder one - and they seem to ignore their father. All goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father. Then it hits you, \"your sister has been dead for years now\" It turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn't know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well.As for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sister's alter ego) is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in! I hope it has been made clearer for confused Asian horror fans out there.Finally - my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack.

I like some mystery, but a slightly stronger framework at the conclusion (namely, the 'stepmother's' failure to immediately come to the girl's aid and get help, and some clarity as to that woman's actual presence in the house after the deaths) would have greatly supported what is otherwise a stunning, hypnotic thriller. So, YES, you get lost. YES, too, lines are blurred between madness and the real. But that's what crazy is, people, and this is definitely not a case of a sloppy writer/director being lazy. As is true of the garbage a lot of reviewers here are pointing to as brilliant, like 'Darko'. Maybe it's an American thing: after all, Americans like excess, many think aging adolescents like Tarantino are skilled, and overt pretentiousness is seen as craft. But, enough of my ranting.

This is movie where memory, speculation and intuition of the watchers all come into play to sum it up for you.Another thing that makes this movie truly magnificent is the fact that many things aren't explained even through all the information you have gathered and this is all left down for the individual viewer to decide. Let's take the example of the father, he always appears strangely calm and comfortable yet there was a scene where he was laying next to his own daughter. Many people would class this as incest however, there was no sexual activity going on perhaps he was just laying down next her trying to make her feel more comfortable and not scared/frightened? Who knows, this is never explained and all left down for you decide.Each scene carries such in depth meaning that you really need to pay attention to. This is why I would compare this movie with a crime book because you need to pay attention to every last detail. The horror side of the movie mixes in the fictional world of ghosts and demons to realistic and harsh reality of an individual's life story which many can sympathize and empathize with; the loss of a loved one, family secrets and family tragedy.A Tale of Two Sisters will certainly not disappoint anyone expecting a movie about meaning, horror or reality. By the end of this movie you're almost guaranteed that you'll be eager to talk to someone about this movie to compare conclusions and speculations. Nearly everyone who watches this movie will have to watch it a second time so they can try to fully understand it. You most certainly won't be disappointed with A Tale of Two Sisters, with whatever you're looking to gain out of this movie because you will definitely find it.P.S.

The American remake,\"The Uninvited\", which I saw recently first, I thoroughly enjoyed, and found the plot twists clever and unexpected. This film is longer, slower to develop, and more ambiguous throughout. Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to appreciate the artistry that others seem to have observed, and while most reviews of the remake were favorable, those who saw the Korean film first were disappointed by the remake. The clever ending regarding the stepmother kept this from being a total disappointment, but I liked the remakes additions and final twist better. My recommendation is to see \"The Uninvited\" before watching \"Tale\", and see whether you agree with me. I find that if I see a film and then read the book, I like the film better usually, but when I read the book first, the film usually disappoints. Maybe the same is true of remakes. It's what you see (or read) first that matters.'\n",

The film starts confused with lack of direction, script wise, but as the story progresses more of the film is revealed. The final reveal is hard hitting as the events that occurred prior were mere projections of the protagonist's mind due to suffering from dissociative identity disorder. Guilt and unacceptance of loss are the major themes, all revolving around family drama. If the final reveal was sprinkled over the story instead of being collected towards the end, the film wouldn't have been so slow and weak. The cinematography evoked a sense of claustrophobia, though in some parts it did not. Augmenting certain character arcs and presenting them on screen would have greatly improved the pacing and story.5.5/10'\n",

I also couldn't make up my mind as to what I thought about it because whilst watching it the first time, I kept impatiently waiting for \"the twist\". So I can see why some people who do that would think that it is slow-moving but if you pay attention to the dialogue (hint hint; especially from the father) you will be able to figure out what is going on.I personally didn't think that it was boring at all, in fact, I thought that it has many very scary and disturbing scenes.After watching this movie for a second time, I definitely think that it is indeed a masterpiece. I actually had a long dream very similar to this movie five years ago (as the Sumi character) and it was the best and most disturbing dream that I have ever had in my life. I should have written a script =)OK, back to this movie. The actors and actresses are amazing in their roles. If the Stepmother and Sumi didn't win awards, I would say that they were robbed. The father confused me at first but once I understood what was going on, I thought that he was great as well and SuYeon was also very very good especially since the character could have easily been annoying like the weak mother in The Wicker Man (a very terrible scary movie but hilarious dialogue).The music is great and I loved how they used certain classical instruments because as a classical musician I know that using this technique can really touch emotions. The strings were especially piercing in the pivotal scene.All in all, I think that this is a must-see movie for any serious horror movie fans with a brain. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't like to think too much during movies. This is a horror movie with an amazingly deep story. Watch it twice for the full effect. Enjoy~'\n",

I have loved horror movies since I was little and I can honestly say I've watched every movie in the genre that I've got my hands on. Poor ones as well as the good.Back to that night: there was one movie that started out as a drama, and I relaxed into my seat after a couple of movies before that, that gave me quite a fright. The colours were beautiful, the patterns on the walls, blankets, and cushions alone seemed hand-picked to fit into a theme as if every detail had been painstakingly planned. The music and the sounds along with the actors gave me a slowly growing feeling of unease, but even so, I was still quite calm and thought it would be a sweet and dark story with a touch of a thriller. How truly wrong I was.The little scene that tipped me over, in the midst of all this beauty, was something as simple as a hand creeping around a door frame. My heart dropped into my stomach and it had been a long while since I had felt such dread. Such a little detail and yet it terrified me! As the story unwound, I felt my skin crawling, and the fact that the places where there was REAL horror were so few, I could never relax. I expected ghosts around every corner and my own imagination ran wild.That is the sign of a true horror movie: your own thoughts do half the work. There is no need for monsters and gore  there is only a need for a 'mood' that catches you constantly unawares.Add to this that the story itself is brilliant and keeps you on your toes. You are forced to concentrate on everything because everything is poignant. There is not a moment when your mind can slip into dumb-fun mode and that makes the movie all that much more frightening.The girl sitting next to me - not someone I knew - started crying halfway through and her boyfriend had to follow her out of the theatre.Along with The Shining, The Exorcist and The Changeling, Janghwa, Hongryeon stands as my favourite horror movie of all time.'\n",

The elements of haunted house eeriness have never been as expertly nor beautifully created as in this Korean horror. What's really great is that the mcguffin not only has all the pleasure of a Shyamalan twist with none of the aggrandisement, but also leaves plenty for audiences to argue about. What you'll remember though is the shocks; clichéd maybe, but directed with brilliance, and drawn out to excruciating lengths. Lock the cushions in a cupboard so you won't be tempted to hide behind them.'\n",

            "Review: 'This is a relatively famous Korean horror film that finds its way into many lists and DVD players of fans of Asian horror or Asian extreme cinema. It's the story of a young girl, Su-mi, who through anger, grief, guilt, and fear, replays her family's tragedy over and over in her head, transferring identities and constantly reworking associations to create a surreal, trippy ride through a mentally overburdened mind.If that sounds very David Lynch to you, you wouldn't be too off. However, this is a lot more expository than his mind-trip thrillers, and works in a severely different way. Honestly, \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" owes almost all of its success to the ineffably aloof camera work and a weird, uncanny feel to its movement. Genre motifs such as girls with hair in their faces, quick cuts, and gore work more because of how quiet and removed everything feels from everything. In fact, it almost doesn't work because everything is so quiet, it's hard to believe that anybody \"doesn't hear\" anything else that is going on in that house.However, its mood pays off and this movie ultimately stands as a realized work of Gothic horror. I could have done with a bit less of the exposition at the end, as \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" works so much better when it leaves the details and especially association to the audience. However, I suppose it could be argued that in terms of understanding the characters' relationships to each other, an understanding of what really happened is necessary.--PolarisDiB'\n",

Unable to convince a Korean co- worker to go with me, I ended up seeing the film alone, in Korean (a language in which I have a 20-word vocabulary). I thought I was following it until about 2/3 of the way through. Then it lost me. Every time I thought I had a handle on what was going on, I was thrown for another loop.So I rented it on DVD, thinking that having subtitles so I could understand the dialog would help. Let's just say it made it about 10% less confusing. I at least ended up with a theory about what was really going on. I had to read some of the spoiler-laden reader comments to sort it all out, and I'm still not sure I'm really clear on it.That said, the film is breathtaking in terms of mood, visuals, and drawing you into the sisters' relationship. If you like creepy, spooky, eerie films that leave you going, \"What the *$#()$ happened?\" you'll love \"A Tale of Two Sisters.\"'\n",

            "Review: '\"Tale of Two Sisters\" has to be one of the creepiest films I've seen recently. In the end there is no actual supernatural element, despite what one is led to expect throughout the film. The story seems to be about two sisters, who, upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence (later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution) are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi-polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time., but some presence as yet unexplained. It is later revealed that the younger sister is dead, and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister, who was unable to save her, and her step-mother, who was callous enough to let her die. Much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film, but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion. Definitely not light viewing; watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen. It's a hell of a puzzler.'\n",

Is a good story - well written, well acted, with a fantastic directing and cinematography. No one can deny that. But i think is more like a good and clever idea that results well but in the end is not amazingly original. the characters that matter the most aren't that developed, because the film is more worried in scaring and amaze visually the viewer, than to create more complex characters. Don't get me wrong, the scenes were like art pictures, delicate and scary at the same time, but the tricks and gimmicks were pretty much the same. The main twist is not very original even in 2003. It was a great scary ride with one compelling character but in the end that's not much different from other movies before this one.It's a great emotional puzzle, but i think there are some better Asian thrillers. Given that, Jee Won Kim is an amazing director, and has some fantastic films. I just would've have liked a slightly different script for this one.'\n",

If you are scared watching it the first time, you will bawl your eyes out watching it the second time after you understand what really happened in the movie. Spoiler alert: Knowing the twist does not subtract from enjoying the movie but rather augment it. I see some commenters say the movie leaves no clue to predict the ending. This is utterly and completely wrong. Any observant watcher upon watching it the first time wouldn't be absolutely surprised by the revelation. If you are taken aback by the ending, I recommend you watch it again and look for clues. The only minus is the slow pace that helps build up the atmosphere but also drags out the story at some point, which definitely does not sit well with Hollywood horror fans who expect jump scares every minute of the movie. A complex psyschological drama about family love and longing in disguise as a horror, A tale of two sisters deserves to be on the top horror movies of all time list.'\n",

And if you've seen numerous Asian horror films, I can't imagine that you won't be bored out of your mind.Perhaps my expectations were too high. I heard that this is the \"scariest movie ever.\" And while I generally don't think too much of statements like that, it came from the message board for \"The Eye,\" a Pang Bros. film that, while its conclusion was pretty bad, provided the creepiest, scariest movie moments I've ever seen.

A horror movie like no other, this relies on its gloomy atmosphere, twists in the plot and a constant pace of thrill in order to scare its viewers.

This movie is dramatic and tragic, while violent and ghostly at the same time. This movie is a must see for fans of psychological drama/horror, or fans of Asian cinema.

It's truly amazing, but every time you watch this movie, you seem to understand more of it, and the way the discussion board right here on IMDb is so alive and prosperous even when the movie has been released 3 and half years proves that it is something that you can enjoy more and more as time goes on rather than being a one-off flick only picked up because you can't think of something better to do. If you like a movie that leaves you reflecting (both in a logical and emotional way), then this is definitely a title you shouldn't miss. While it is classified as horror, and there are a few genuinely scary scenes (for myself at least -- but i'm an easily scared person), it is really a story themed on emotional traumatisation and its aftermaths, and in this aspect, it is truly deeply touching. I could find myself completely immersed in the situation of the main character and feel the pain that she's feeling. I must say the actresses/actors do a wonderful job, and the cinematography (including the design and symbolism of the set) and the music score are outstanding too. It would be against the purpose of the movie for me to comment anything on what actually happens in the movie. But even if after you watch it (hopefully you will after seeing this review) and find it confusing/not so good, don't become immediately disappointed or cheated. Have a look at the discussion board here (especially the 'explanations of a masterpiece' post by opiemar). It may open up a whole new perspective for you like it did for me. This is one of those few movies that you should not only watch, but want to keep as well (for repeat viewings). So i give my 120% endorsement for it.'\n",

I don't remember where I heard about this movie but since I had heard about it, it must be considered good by a lot of people out there, so I thought. I resisted checking it up on the internet and reading about it to get a first-hand experience of it.I was left confused.It's supposed to be a kind of horror thriller. I think it that way because of the usage of camera angles and background sounds which is undoubtedly good. The acting by the entire cast is impressive and there is lot of detailing of the characters including the way they would wear their hair, dresses etc. There's a deep psycho-dramatic touch to the entire story and that's where I guess, the writers ended up overdoing the bit.The movie is about two sisters who move into a house with their dad and have to deal with their step-mother. Thereon in, it describes how the tensions arise and situation gets wildly out of hand which brings in the psychological bit and blood and emotional horror. And this is pretty much what I could derive from the entire movie. The moment I got a little grasp of characters and the settings, I was waiting for something logical and conclusive to happen. It didn't. And that's my biggest grouse from movies this kind. The premise is wonderful, you've a great subject at hand with good performers. But then the story is so full of the psychological and forced complications like alter-egos, flashbacks, surreal dialogs, sightings that, in a way, it seems that the writers try too hard to put their point across. And as is the case with overdone things, there are too many loose ends to make any sense of. \"Why, how, what, where, when\": you'd end up asking all sorts of questions at most points in the movie. I like this genre of psychological thrillers but most of the successful movies leave a sense of completion in you when you walk out of the theater even if they leave you with unanswered questions.All in all, it's a collage of distinct visuals with only one thing clear: psychologically complex and disturbed characters. That's about it.'\n",

It is exceptionally well made and beautifully filmed, maintains a sense of dread throughout and is ultimately heartbreaking. But for all that, this is a film too opaque by half, with so many feints, fake outs, and misdirection that one almost needs a scorecard. This is a film in which: -a character imagines or pretends to be two other characters who aren't actually there.-the two characters who aren't there have several scenes in which they are the only ones present. (If a ghost argues with an imaginary person and no one else is in the room at the time, is that why they can yell and scream and smash things and no one else hears?) -one of the imagined people who isn't really there has nightmares. Given she doesn't tell anyone about the nightmares, and she doesn't exist anyway, how is it we see her nightmares? I suspect even David Cronenberg would reject this as too weird.-one of the imagined people also exists as a ghost in the house.-the father, as it turns out, knows that his daughter Su-mi is unstable to the point of pretending to be her stepmother, and he deems it prudent to go along with this, to the point of letting her sleep next to him in his bed. I'm gonna go out on a limb and venture that this was a bad call.-a dinner party is so bizarrely awkward and strange that a ghost hiding under the sink is practically a footnote.I don't mean to be merely snarky. I really do, overall, think highly of this film. But at a certain point it's just all a bit much. I've no objection to a film making you work a bit to fully understand it, but A Tale of Two Sisters puts you through a Bataan Death March in order to understand it. And even then, the puzzle pieces don't all fit together.'\n",

I might be angering a few die hard fans, but I don't consider this a horror movie in the slightest. This movie isn't meant to invoke solely fear, which most horror films amount to. Although this film has an eerie atmosphere and definitely some moments that make you cover your eyes, the underlying plot is much more than a cheap thriller. It's a film composed of an amazing soundtrack, amazing visuals, amazing plot, and amazing actors. The film can be a bit confusing, and I must admit that after watching for the first time, I wasn't completely smitten. But to be honest, I think that's just the way a movie like this is. After watching the second time, you see the movie more through Su-mi's eyes. It's incredibly sad and if you don't shed a single tear on first viewing, you'll be crying buckets the second, third, and yes even fourth, time. After the first viewing I was confused and angry. After the second viewing, the ending scene made me cry buckets. After the third viewing, just hearing the music at the beginning and watching Su-mi and Su-yeon get out of the car made me cry.

While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All of these are handled superbly by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the lead character. Also worthy of particular mention is Yum Jung-ah, who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother.

A tale of two sisters does get very confusing but it does it in a way that does not end up being annoying. foreign movies don't need to have massive shock scenes to be scary. when a movie creeps you out to the point of not being able to get to sleep at night it is truly a horror movie. these types of movies i call 'chill' movies and they can really send shivers down your spine. if you like this amazing feeling, i would also recommend 'the eye' which might not be made perfectly but it sent millions of shivers down my spine.a tale of two sisters is a clever, psychological, scary, well acted and directed movie that in my opinion impossible not to enjoy. i watch a lot of movies and i do get very picky on poor acting, plots and directing. this movie managed to draw me in enough to forget about all this judging.i don't like to hype up movies too much but i find it unbelievable how many people dislike this movie. if you enjoyed the original ring or the remake, you are likely to get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie even though both movies are very different i don't like scores out of ten so am giving this movie ***** which you might of gathered from this review'\n",

Also, this movie has to be one of the most beautiful and stylish looking things you'll ever see...most Dario Argento fans will have seen the film Suspiria which showcases bizarre and surreal but amazing colours...well this is the only other movie that will make effect you in a similar way because the colour is so amazing...and also because this is like a tale, there's flowers that appear everywhere...on clothes,on walls, and on normal items like the diary's and stuff!So with out any doubt...make sure to check this film out...for it by far my all-time favorite movie and one that deserves to be watched!!!'\n",

            "Review: 'This mystery-chiller focuses on a pair of sisters who return home after a period away and are immediately thrown into an uncomfortable and eerie environment where they must contend with their apathetic father, their abusive step-mother and what seems to be some sort of ghostly presence. It's evident right from the start that something is amiss in 'A Tale Of Two Sisters (2003)'. The characters' interactions are strained, and there's a palpable tension in the air that hangs over everything like a black cloud. In-between the strange family dynamics and general sense that things aren't quite as they appear are moments clearly inspired by J-horror such as 'Ringu (1998)' and 'Ju-On: The Curse (2000)', creepy encounters with potential apparitions that are genuinely quite unsettling. The whole experience has this nightmarish quality to it where you're never quite sure what to take at face value. It goes hard on its enigmas and, for the most part, refuses to spell things out for you. Having said that, the way it handles its ultimate revelations is more confusing than it needs to be and it feels like it's constantly trying to outdo itself by piling reveal upon reveal onto its audience. Even its main twist has a twist, and it then proceeds to reveal that there's a secondary twist that runs in the background as well. It arguably does too much, diluting the effect of its most potent moments. It also feels kind of like it serves purely as a vessel for its various twists (one of which I successfully predicted within the first few scenes), and that further dampens its effect somewhat... at least to begin with. The longer you let the piece sit with you, the more effective it becomes in retrospect. As the confusion washes away (the narrative does make sense and it presents you with all the information you need to know that), the picture's potent heartbreak and confident craftsmanship becomes more and more clear. Still, it's hard to deny the initial disappointment that occurs when the flick finishes. It's also hard to deny that the two most major twists are incredibly common, which does weaken them somewhat even if they're ultimately more-or-less entirely saved by their execution. I think some tightening up of the final edit would have gone a long way in alleviating the issues I have, as the main body of the piece is pretty much rock solid in its presentation. Ultimately, this has some really compelling sequences and a tragic underpinning that survives the clumsiness of some late-game revelations. It's a solid effort, despite its few problems.'\n",

NOTHING in this movie was scary except for the sheer boredom of it all. Like all Asian movies, this one moves at the speed of molasses. Apparently, there's something about Asians being frightened of long gaps of silence. Every now and then, however, that autistic girl (Su-yeon) would scream in the most ear-piercing tone humanly possibly. These screams were often followed by the two girls caressing each other in true incestuous fashion. There's no such thing as a sudden scare, only drawn out \"intense\" moments with no reward. The best part of this movie is that since it is in subtitles, you can watch the whole thing in fast forward and you can avoid that annoying autistic girl's piercing screams. Save your money and wait until it's done right in the American remake.'\n",

Large portions of the film were shot in almost total darkness so you couldn't even see who or what was doing what. Many plot holes were left totally unexplained.What made the film truly awful, though, was the way she kept waking up from dreams. It was like, this is reality, oh no wait that part was a dream, this is real, no wait, that was a dream too, or maybe it was just her imagination, or who knows what.

They have a new stepmother who is making a concerted effort to be polite to the girls, but is faced with hostility and indifference from Soo-mi. As the elder sister, Soo-mi feels responsible for the younger and naive Soo-yeon and does her best to protect her from the step mother. The two sisters keep themselves separate from the stepmother and this gradually builds into tension and resentment between the stepmother and Soo-mi. Suddenly a major plot twist is revealed and the film completely turns on its head into an original and unique conclusion which left me confused and immediately sought to re-watch the last hour again. This is definitely a slow burner, but the originality of the plot leaves the viewer intrigued and satisfied as to how this has been portrayed.

The combination of Mo-gae Lee's beautiful cinematography, impeccable performances from a small but outstanding cast (Su-jeong Lim is especially impressive, taking the difficult emotions she has to portray believably into account), and a story that manages to be at once horrifying, believable and accessible make this one of the finest films and most effective horrors of the last ten years. Not to mention you'll never look at kitchen sinks the same way again...The score by Byung-woo Lee stands out, ranging from low-key and moody to intensely loud at all the right places, and perfectly accentuating the colourful and rich photography. The sound design is incredible - the buzz of a TV set has never been more chilling. All of this ensures that the atmosphere is thick throughout, almost unbearable at times, courtesy of director Ji-woon Kim. This guy (whom I previously had never even heard of) has understood what so many other directors can't seem to grasp: horror is all about atmosphere and mood. This is what makes \"A Tale of Two Sisters\", quite simply, brilliant. I could write more, but it's best to watch the film knowing as little as possible about it, so all I can do is urge you to watch it as soon as possible. I'd place it next to Kubrick's \"The Shining\" (1980), Miike's \"Audition\" (1999) and Bergman's \"Hour of the Wolf\" (1968) on my short list of the most frightening horror films I've ever seen, as well as one of the best.

It begins with them exploring the surroundings of the new house. They go inside, and they're step-mother immediately is ordering them around. They run upstairs out of fear, and go to their rooms. They open they're wardrobes and find that there is nothing but the same clothing. Su-Yeon is deathly afraid of her wardrobe, and wont go near it. Su-yeon is acting extremely weird, along with everyone else in the house, and Su-Mi is trying to figure out why. Not until the end is there a big bombshell dropped by the father that ties all the lose ends together.I absolutely loved this movie. With such an intricate plot, and a sense of dread and fear, it takes you on an emotional roller coaster, of fear and confusion. This movie features superb acting, especially by Geun-yeong Mun and Jung-ah Yum.

Neither the younger sister nor the \"crazy\" stepmom really exist for most of this movie, they are all projections in her mind (and a real ghost too just for kicks!) It all comes back to the scene at the top of the stairs toward the end while the older sis and the stepmom are engaged in a terse conversation and \"stepmom\" warns her that she will regret this moment. As for the bag, she was beating a doll that was inside it. The pills are for older sis. There was no real blood in the bag as she tried to kill herself with the statue. I still don't get the same books and pencil, same folded clothes stuff at the beginning. Anyone? **** ANYWAY... this movie is excellent, scary and unnverving enough that I had a stomach ache watching it! It has everything you could possibly want in a horror movie, scary house, scary dolls, scary clocks, creep stepmom, drugs, hallucinations, nightmares even scary wallpaper!!! Excellent use of color and sound it never degenerated to superfluous gore or graphic violence to \"get you\", it achieved an incredible amount of horror through pure traditional devices such as great directing and acting (for a change) and editing!!! Its suspense and creepiness sink you into the film and draw your attention to a details that are crucial all the way through (if you can watch without holding your hand up to the screen!). Most Asian horror flicks are good for cheap thrills, some better than others (Eye 2 was also good but nobody talks about it, Eye 1 was a bit cheese) but A Tale of Two Sisters is way way out there ahead. On a par with The Shinning for suspense and terror and with The Others for its ability to scare without any outright violence/gore. I like someone else's comparison of Spirited Away meets The Shinning.Really worth the watching, especially if you can see it projected on a wall/screen or large TV with good sound late at night. Sound is crucial to all these types of films. My only complaint is that the English subtitles are so freakin slow you have no idea who is speaking at times due to the lag, really bad job on that.

The film is pretty much about two boring and wooden sisters who get to see female ghosts of some sort popping out from the silence. And that's the movie for you: Mostly long shots of silence and then wardrobe or cupboard doors that creak open. Yawn.What's the point of the stereotypical 'Asian girl' ghosts popping out? At least The Uninvited (2009) explains this, and yet people find that one with the cheap scares. Dudes, this film not only has cheap and banal jump scares, they're also irrelevant and completely useless to the film's disorienting and dizzying plot. Again, the horror scenes in the remake are way more striking because they're relevant to the plot and they are explained. This film was a try-hard in comparison and it didn't explain much. At times, the ghost scenes were very random.Lastly, I did not understand the stepmother in this. Was she really evil or just misunderstood? Or was she an alter ego? What I liked about the remake was that the stepmother was very well explained for the audience and there was that one big reveal at the end, which involved her character being explained and justified. This film threw in one twist after another in the most mundane way ever towards the last half hour. Now I'm not talking about exciting twist and turns, but rather different endings or endings after endings that were convoluted and mind-numbing. The movie just didn't want to end, which made it a torture to sit through!Granted, the acting was good and the cinematography was excellent. But what's the use of those when it comes to terrible screenwriting and storytelling? Also, what was up with the inappropriately sentimental theme music? Suited more a Korean soap opera than a horror film. This film is truly messy. The remake is far more superior, despite its flaws, and this is something I'd rarely say. People hated \"The Uninvited\" because of a cognitive bias - Since, at that time, American horror remakes were a trend and thus audiences were tired of them.'\n",

I have also followed his latest film, a film-noir-gangster, and I must say, again it has outstanding music and cinematography.Many recent east-Asian films seem to follow the ideas created by Hideo Nakata's film 'Ringu' but this one is purely original. Although there is of course the iconic black-hair-covering-face woman, this representation is becoming increasingly repeated as it relates to Japanese Noh Theatre, so don't feel that Jee-Woon is copying 'Ringu'.I won't spoil the plot for you, but all i will say is, you will probably have to watch the film at least twice to really understand everything.KIM JEE-WOON IS A GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'\n",

Eventually, \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\" was a really complicated movie and I didn't really enjoyed it, because I couldn't understand what was going on, lol. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious and I did had high expectations about that movie. Sadly, the storyline wasn't really simple nor well-explained. The characters were very interesting and well-developed. The filming location of the movie was just a big old house in the middle of nowhere. By the way, that movie was kinda scary and there were some jumpscares during the movie. In my opinion, the plot twist was definitely shocking but it was very complicated and not well-explained. Overall, it was an average movie that I didn't really enjoyed it.'\n",

This movie is a good one. Well, who knows really? I mean, I don't even know what the civilization (Eastern) is about much less their traditions. See, it isn't a matter of suspending my disbelief as much as I don't know what the hell their culture is about. But all the ladies in this movie are dolls while, helping out the plot immensely for my typically simple male mind, there is only two men in it with the old one playing the role of, well, an old man. This movie is \"The Grudge\" meets \"The Other.\" Its music score doesn't follow along playing \"doing ping doing doing ding ding\" like you would expect in an Asian movie score, but actually sounds quite westernly good. You know, I really haven't given any of this movie away, but I had still better give it a spoiler designation. My recommendation? Hey, watch the movie \"The Other\" first. It is simply the most horrible movie and I don't mean quality wise, but horror wise. Certainly all the actors in that movie are still suffering from the effects of the ending to it. Anyway, I would have bought this movie for $3.50. It is that good!'\n",

First of all: Horror. Besides the scene in the bedroom and with the 'ghost' having her period I don't really see any 'horror'. Even this scene did not scare me stiff. Psychological thriller then: not sure what that precisely means but this movie was nor a thriller or a psychological attack on my senses. What is this movie then? Well a confusing one for sure. If I understand it well one person thought she was another person (or two?) and each time she is another person another actress plays her (I'm still guessing). Now's the thing that the two sisters look so much a like that I never really know who's who (or better where's who). Then there's something about a closet and a bloody bag that I totally don't get. So I keep wondering: did someone die? Was she murdered or was she always a figment of the imagination. Well, this is a 'masterpiece' I will forget very quickly and absolutely not recommend to people who love 'Asian Horror'. Because it has nothing to do with Horror.'\n",

While it was beautifully filmed, with a tonal quality to match the mood of the film, the story remained a bit empty. Being a psychological thriller, the end revelation should be as powerful as the story that leads up to it. But instead, it's disappointing. What's more, once you discover the truth, you realize that many of the scary elements leading up to it were unnecessary and make no sense. They were basically included because they're scary, not because they had anything to do with the storyline. This, I find, is a major fault of the movie.There are other psychological thrillers/horror movies that end much better, where all the disturbing or strange parts of the story finally make sense (M. Night Shyamalan). Maybe I'm missing some cultural context here, but this story seemed forcefully scarier than it should have been to make sense. Whereas with M. Night's movies, upon second viewing, they're rarely as scary as the first. That's because M. Night's stories are good STORIES, not just horror stories. Tale of Two Sisters, however, upon further viewings, would probably still seem scary but emptier.'\n",

            "Review: 'A Tale of Two Sisters is a Korean horror flick, supposedly more creepy than gruesome, similar in style to The Others or The Sixth Sense. I was really looking forward to seeing it, so after a quick dinner my wife and I shut off all the lights, slipped it in the DVD player, and hit the play button.The very first thing that grabbed my attention was the atmosphere that this film was able to get across. The cinematography, sound effects, and acting made even a straightforward scene of a girl sitting at a table in a white room seem extra-creepy. The girl just sits there, with her head looking down and her hair hiding her face as a man questions her about some event in her past. She says nothing, and we are left wondering just exactly what has happened to this girl. It's a wonderful opening scene which really sets the mood for the whole movie.We are then taken to the outside of an old, haunted-looking house where we are introduced to two sisters, the elder Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon. We get to see how close they are, and find out that they used to live in this house before their unnamed illness required them to stay at the hospital. But now they're better, and Eun-joo, their step-mother, seems very excited to finally have them home... however neither sister shows any sign of caring. In fact, Su-mi seems to seriously dislike her for some reason.Now, all of this takes quite a while to get set up. My wife was already out cold, and I'm sorry to say that I had actually gotten bored by this point. Other than the excellent visual style, there really isn't much going on here to hold your attention. Thankfully, we are shortly thereafter treated to several scenes of uber-creepiness, which is what these types of movies are all about. I won't go into any details, as I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone, but let's just say that this film does a great job at presenting a disturbing and chilling environment. There's no way you won't react in some way or another to what you're seeing on screen.There is no doubt that this production has done a lot of things right. There is much here to praise, such as cinematography, acting, music, sound effects, lighting, and sets, but there is unfortunately one major drawback to this film... after all the twists, turns, and shocks, and revelations... once you finally reach the end and everything has been revealed... you'll still be sitting there in the dark wondering just what the hell is going on.Normally this is where I would start listing all of the instances that still make no sense to me, probably with some sarcastic comments thrown in, but I can't really do that without giving away at least some of the twists. And then I would tell you all about some of the really cool scenes that would just freak you out and make my wife close her eyes and turn away, but again I can't do that without revealing something that you should really see for yourself.Suffice to say, if you are a fan of the slow, eerie-type horror flicks, then you should definitely check this one out. Yes, they probably could have cut out about 20 minutes of this film... and yes, by the end you'll be scratching your head just like that one month when you were all out of dandruff shampoo... but there is still a lot here to enjoy.'\n",

The film-makers and actors were very good at their jobs, which resulted in a host of scenes which were well done ; however, these scenes, from my point of view failed go coalesce into a pointed, powerful whole. The film seemed to meander about through atmospheric and emotional scenarios, which in the end lacked a clear focus. I tend to think of Stanley Kubrick, who purportedly spent a great amount of time to prepare for his films. Since filming is an expensive and complicated business, I presume, that screen-writers do not always have the time necessary to prepare their ideas, before they are subject to the demands of filming. I often see films, that start out impressively and I find myself wondering if this level of ideas and craft will be sustained for the entire film. I am often disappointed, as the film's quality seems to crumble, as it nears its conclusion. I don't know if the cultural differences in this particular film, made it less accessible to me or not, as that could possibly have contributed to my lack of comprehension.'\n",

You are either in the camp that thinks it is sheer brilliance or in the one that thinks it is  pure confusion. I belong to the latter camp. The pacing of the film, especially in the early going, is painfully slow. Although it seems to generate a sense of foreboding, the resolution of the metaphoric \"calm before the storm\" is less than satisfying. As the show plods on, we are treated to a potpourri of the screenwriter's imitation of various great classics of the same genre, namely \"The Sixth Sense\", \"The Others\" and \"Ringu\". Not that the film is not without scary moments, but they are disjointed and seem to be there more for effects than for promoting the continuity of the storyline. The constant shifting between time periods also makes this film rather difficult to follow. Even though the last sequences toward the end of the film do manage to tie the storyline together, it still leaves much to be explained. For instance, what is the significance of the \"bloody bag\"? It only makes sense if you take most of the show to be in fact psychotic imaginations of the asylum bound older sister while the last part of the show explains why she ended up in the mental asylum. I must confess that I do not speak Korean and I watched a copy of this film with both English and Chinese subtitles. Maybe something was lost in the translation of the subtitles (which is inevitable in most cases) or maybe I was just not sensitive to the cultural cues within the movie, I have to say this film fell far short of what I would call a horror masterpiece. I give it a generous 5 out of 10!'\n",

Granted, it is very difficult to differentiate between what is imagined and what is real (especially since I am American and certainly do not pick up on fine points of societal reference), but I'm not certain that the ENTIRE film wasn't all from the point of view of the girl. In other words, perhaps there was not even a single moment in the film that was \"real\". Perhaps the entire film is within the mind of a little girl desperately trying to deal with her grief. If so, the \"real\" moments would have to be imagined as well.If there were \"real\" moments in the film, then I am profoundly confused. Why would the doctor release a patient as non-responsive as the girl was in the very beginning of the film? Why would the step mother seem so disturbed as she did at the end when she was waiting in the hallway (sitting on a bench) while the father was talking to people (doctors?) at the end of the hall? And didn't they seem to be talking about (and looking at) the step mother? What was up with that?Those are just a few of the things that don't make sense to me if there is, in fact, any \"reality\" in the movie. Interesting note - In the USA, if there is gravel or dirt placed by the side of the road for future use in some sort of construction or repair it is frequently covered with a tarp or cloth to protect it from washing away with the rain. Because of that, I never thought twice about the \"tent\" in the road.Rant - Why in God's green earth is it so hard to find decent subtitles for these films? Lol. It was well worth the trouble to get good ones, but man you would think the subs would be of better quality and easier to find for films like this one that are popular and considered to be excellent.Overall, I loved the film.

Hollywood has been eyeing nations like Japan and Korea for years now, borrowing their tales of fear and reinventing them for domestic audiences. In fact, one of the latest remakes was this year's The Uninvited, a story told six years prior in South Korea's most successful horror feature to date, A Tale of Two Sisters. Directed and scripted by Kim Ji-woon, Two Sisters is not original fiction either, itself based on Joseon Dynasty's folktale \"Janghwa Hongreyon-jon,\" which roughly translates to \"Rose Flower, Red Lotus.\" It tells of Su-mi (played by Im Soo Jung), a young woman haunted by the deaths of her mother and younger sister Su-yeon (Moon Guen Young), which triggers a psychological downward spiral that summits with an abrupt twist that'll catch anyone offguard. One scene in particular, a two-minute dream sequence set in Su-mi's daylit bedroom, must be amongst the creepiest and most disturbingly beguiling displays in the history of horror movies, evocative of Japan's Ju-on: The Grudge. It sets a nightmarish atmosphere, despite being cast in the light of day, perfectly stirring up long-forgotten fears that have been dormant since they've become immune to the tactics of American cinema. These unnerving scenes are few and far between, but are well-worth sitting through the two hours of subtitled ingenuity, using thought-provoking terror to entice viewers rather than blood-shedding butchery. I won't give away the ending of Two Sisters, or even the character development for that matter, so that you can go into this foreign excursion incognito, expecting nothing but a riveting tale of love lost, blanketed by uneasy oppression. Its Korean-language format may be a distraction at first, but you'll settle in just fine, that is until you find yourself stricken with the jitters from that aforementioned dream episode.'\n",

Being familiar with both the first and the second wave of Japanese film-making, with names like Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ozu, Suzuki, Imamura, Kobayashi, Teshigahara, and others, naturally one had justifiably great expectations for this reappearance of Japan on the silver screen. And the new wave DID pay off, at first. My eyes, and mind, were first blown open by Takashi Miike's sublime Audition, with its blend of cinematic reverie and gutwrenching, body-mutilating literality. Also, of course, Hideo Nakata's two Ringu films, with their postmodern remix of myth and technology, managed to turn a few heads, including mine. His Dark Water also delivered, big time. But then, what do you know, it solidified into a genre cinema, with all the attendant marketing and export values, and of course, banality and standardization followed. We have been treated to a series of films quoting chapter and verse from Ringu, including Takashi Miike's shockingly conventional and uninspired One Missed Call; Byeong-ki Ahn's utterly unoriginal Phone also looms large on this list. The Pang Brother's ridiculous The Eye could also be mentioned (I mean, HOW can you take a film seriously that takes it's denouement from the awful Richard Gere vehicle The Mothman Prophecies, the most pathetically un-scary horror film of all time? And I AM talking chapter and verse here). But, old darlings apparently die slow, and so, enter A Tale of Two Sisters. Hopes high after glowing reviews, me and a friend went to see it.Let's just put it like this: we have vowed NEVER to see another J-horror movie, unless we have it from a very reliable source that it's actually worth the effort. This film isn't, in the extreme. Thematically, it reads as a Korean version of Amenabar's The Others, but where that film managed to stay composed and terse all the way through, and actually both frightened and surprised you in equal measure, this film is just unfocused and vague, filled with schlocky artful suspense that is supposed to keep you on the edge of your chair, but doesn't, really. It doesn't even manage to deliver as a horror film, doesn't have the energy to whip up a decent level of scare: the \"terrifying\" scenes are few and far apart (once again, Ringu chapter and verse: think Sadako coming out of the TV...). Unlike, say, the magnificent and mindbending Old Boy, where each turn in the complex narrative was accompanied by horrifying depictions of bodily mutilation and transformation, actually managing to create a sort of shadow world of corporeal insecurity, a bodily mirroring of the compositional pace of the film. That film was utterly spellbinding, as good cinema should be; this IS NOT. DON'T see it.'\n",

I just don't buy that he wouldn't be attentive. And if he is just not that willing to assist in this manner, then his character is underdeveloped. Why is he not attentive? I never learn what he does for a living. At the dinner table, the first night, he just excuses himself to attend to some business after eating a meal that SHE, the girl that just got back from the hospital and is moping around, prepared? I guess you wouldn't have a film if you didn't take these liberties, but I still feel cheated. The Shinning(book & film), on the other hand, is much more of a masterpiece because it DOESN'T HAVE THESE FAULTS. Everything in the beginning of that story is \"normal.\" We are told the resort was built on an ancient burial ground, so we expect and can accept ghosts. Thus, we can accept when the \"sane\" characters, like the child and wife see apparitions. But we can also see and accept how the main character's work in isolation could lead to insanity and his visions. We are left debating whether the place cursed him or whether he is insane. In \"The Tale of Two Sisters\" we are not given that opportunity. Yes we see her in an institution when we open, but as I mentioned above, the story jumps straight to a point where she is left ALONE for long periods of time, not with her father. And I can't accept that that would happen in real life. Thus, I feel cheated.'\n",

            "Review: 'The plot in this film is strikingly similar to Robert Mulligan's \"The other\" (1972), also dealing with the strange relationship between two (twin) brothers. Can anybody explain why the older sister finds an exact copy of her diary in the drawer and several identical dresses in the cupboard? Also: why in most of the pictures she finds in the box there is only one baby girl? And of course I didn't get what the bloody sack meant.Spanish subtitles reveal far too much from the beginning, for singular is used instead of plural when the father talks to the girls. It wouldn't happen in English, of course, but I wonder if it happens too in Korean (whether there is a \"you\" form for singular and another one for plural). Speaking of which, does anybody know what \"Janghwa, Hongryeon\" means?The film was \"spoiled\" from me even before watching it because of several newspapers reviews comparing it to \"The sixth sense\" or \"The others\"...'\n",

Thank goodness for that.But the one conclusion I have come to on my own, is this (and if someone else already said this, I do apologize) - this movie is much like the movie \"The Other\" (not \"The Others\" with Nicole Kidman). Obviously not in total plot, but with the same general idea and context: two sisters. One is dead. The other one has not accepted that the one is dead. The one sibling still talks to the dead sibling, and spends time with them as if they are alive. Some family members actually encourage this.Watch \"The Other\" and see what you think. I read the book a long time ago, and have the movie on DVD now. I'm going to watch it tomorrow. I'll see what other connections I can make.'\n",

He continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere.The story is about two girls who are taken home, after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before hand. They are greeted on their arrival by their trying-way-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-so-totally-evil Stepmother, who the girls obviously hold resentment for. As time goes on at home, the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. And, to top it all off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' recovery...This film is amazing. It has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming, it almost makes you cry at some points (I know I had a teary moment of two, specifically 'the cupboard scene'). But what I love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits.

            "Review: '\"A Tale of Two Sisters\" has a twisted little nature evocative of such films as \"Momento\" and the Japanese \"Audition.\" Rent it, gather your friends, and make sure they bring their security blankets.The film begins with two sisters, Soo-mi and Soo-yeun, returning home from an extended stay at a mental hospital. Hesitant to enter the house, the sisters linger outdoors and we see glimpses of the girls' past playing outside the house. Dawdling too long, the girls must enter the dark and dilapidated family home, a once elegant house, recently in decay. Soon, they are confronted by a creepily-cheery stepmother. From the very beginning, there is a sense of something innately wrong with the house and it's inhabitants. The girls' father is distant, troubled, and seems generally \"spooked.\" The \"evil\" stepmother is at first superficially hospitable and upbeat, but angers quickly when stressed, and the girls themselves are isolated and hostile. As the drama of the family heats, the ghost story emerges, leaving questions regarding the nature of the family's trouble. With a good combination of banal, introspective and shocking moments, the film builds toward a climax that simultaneously drops a brain-bending bomb and answers all your questions.The story, acting, mood and cinematography are expertly played off each other to keep the audience guessing and reveal a well-sculptured narrative. Though not gory, the scary scenes make you jump, with a mix of unexpected and know-it's-coming-but-can't-stand-waiting-for-it-to-jump-out moments. \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" is a psychological horror that stands tall in a genre that too often falls short, a gem of a film that will stand the test of time, loved dearly by the few who appreciate its diabolical charm.'\n",

            "Review: '*BIG TIME SPOILER* Some of my favorite \"psycho POV\" movies like, Machinist, Secret Window, (both made later in 2004), are somewhat designed to mislead and confuse the viewer in the beginning. You can always go back and say \"why did they include that scene?\", well, partly, to throw you off! It's a masterpiece if it throws you off wrong in the beginning, but, in the end, makes complete sense. Tale of Two Sisters is ALMOST perfect regarding this. Two other movies, The Others, and Sixth Sense, is also pretty good with this technique. I saw this Korean movie twice (first time I hardly was concentrating, thus, totally didn't understand what was going on). Just to clear a MAJOR fact about the movie, the stepmother, the real one, doesn't really show up until the end of the movie. She is in a dark suit, and you can tell her mannerism is totally different from the 'crazy' stepmother portrayed. Actually, it is just Su-mi and her father that are in the house the whole time (it is the stepmother her father keeps talking to on the phone).The ONLY \"hole\" in the story I found was when Su-mi's uncle's wife is riding back in the car with her husband and she said she saw a girl underneath the kitchen sink. That's about it. Everything else seems to 'make sense' to me. Good movie indeed!'\n",

            "Review: 'After the first time seeing the movie and trying to reconcile the plot twist with what happen before, I was still confused on what Soo Yong (younger sister) is doing in the story. I was left with 2 interpretations. A.) She was a ghost who did'nt know she was one or B.) She is part of the hallucinations of psychotic multiple personality afflicted Su Mi (older sister).The 1st family dinner scene is obviously a key scene. Its the only scene were the 4 main characters are in the same visual space. Thus this is one those scene that viewers will look back on to see consistency in the story. In this scene we discover that older sis is assuming her step mom's identity and imagining herself across from the mother. After watching it again, this scene supports interpretation B. The younger sis acts and reacts to the slight quarrel between big sis and stepmom as if it was the real thing. From this scene I conclude that her character can't be a ghost or she would have shown bafflement or indifference to the quarrel. She's got to be part of the hallucination of the older sister.Going back a few scenes to when the girls enter the house and meet their stepmom for the first time after the hospital stay. Again when I watch this scene, I conclude that whole scene is a hallucination by the older sister. Young sis and step mom were part of the imagination of the older sis. Again just like the dinner scene, I believed the older sis is taking her stepmom's identity, and imagine having a conversation with herself and her sister. Again I use the action of the younger sis to come to this interpretation. She appears genuinely afraid of the step mother as oppose to reacting in puzzlement or indifference.But in the 1st big reveal where we found out the younger sister was dead, the younger sister acted as an independent character reacting to the shock that she is a ghost. The noticeable camera shaking when the camera focuses on her validates this point quite effectively. The younger sisters reality collapses at this point. This scene clearly tells us that younger sister is a ghost, and that she had been interacting with big sis all along.The director also tells us in the commentary that the younger sister is a real character, in this case a ghost, and this is the correct interpretation. If that's the case, then the writer and director committed several errors in staging the 1st dinner scene and the step mom introduction scene.Nevertheless I still enjoyed this movie and give props to the writer and director to come up with new twists and variant to the plot twists of thrillers like the 6th sense and The Others. If there is an American remake in this case, they can improve the original by re-staging some scenes to clearly support one interpretation or the other.'\n",

I can't recall the name of it but it's about two sisters as well. Now, I can easily tell that it's one of those crappy Western remakes. Aside from that, I have seen quite a few Psychological films so it can get quite predictable but despite having seen the remake, I was still surprised! Although, I guess I caught on. This film is outstanding. The acting is very well done and you can connect with the characters. The sisterly bond is a very special and beautiful one. I really liked how this film portrayed this bond. Su-mi (which is my nickname) was excellent and convincing. A very likable character. Both sisters are also cute. I am also quite surprised at the people who are knit picking at this movie. Most of those comments seem to be made by people who are big fans of Western horror films.. Haha what a joke. It's quite hard for me to find a horror film that is actually moving and keeps you interested. I've seen The Others, The Sixth Sense, Donnie Darko (boring film) etc. Those films are nothing to rave about at all. The Tale of Two Sisters is much better than those.

Most often the scares come at odd or inopportune moments when your attention is focused on something else, but never in the jump up in your face \"boo\" type scare either. It is hard to understand just how effective the method is until you experience it.Some people have been complaining that the plot was too convoluted or they didn't understand certain story elements. While you are left with a feeling of wanting more, as is the case with riveting stories (like Donnie Darko), the plot will eventually become clear to you. The problem with slow-paced movies is that it often conflicts with the hype. People see the \"10\" ranking and expect to be thrilled from the get-go, and fail to pay mind to the slow story-building scenes. Later on they are disappointed when they're not scared having not realized that they've already detached themselves from the experience.In order to properly enjoy this movie, you must make sure you have absolutely nothing better to do so you can fully open your mind. Have faith that you will not be disappointed, but don't expect to see Neo fighting Morpheus in VR simulated from the belly of a post-apocalyptic space ship. Enjoy.'\n",

Su-mi is the older and stronger of the girls and the more fragile Su-yeon has never been able to stand up to their physically and psychologically abusive step mom.During the following days, the two girls feel there is another presence within the house.

I should clarify that my wife and I, after having our heads turned six ways from Sunday by Shimizu Takashi's masterful Ju-On series, have been on a 'J-Movie/Asian Horror' kick for the past few months, taking in at least 4-6 a week minimum. Both of us like to think we qualify as Well Read Film Geeks - especially in the 'mind-bending psycho-thriller' genre, from which have indeed seen a few Korean entries including 'Phone', 'Memento Mori', 'Bunshinsaba' and 'Ring Virus' among others.Speaking for myself only and with all due respect to everyone else, especially Ji-woon Kim et al, 'Tale of Two Sisters' merely added to my suspicion that I am missing some vital facet that prevents Korean horror from creeping me out for more than a fleeting moment. But don't get the wrong idea here, 'Two Sisters' is a wonderfully crafted film that had some top notch acting and great camera-work, only thing it lacked was a single good scare in my opinion. Very similar to 'Phone' and 'Bunshinsaba' that both worked on some levels but not others, I had the basic 'Two Sisters' endgame figured out as soon as Su-Mi took Su-yeon's hand in the garden before running down to the dock. (And no, the subtitles were not confusing or out of sync, just to address that possibility.) The obvious comparisons of 'Two Sisters' to 'Memento', 'Identity' and 'The Sixth Sense' aside, my main questions regarding story may in fact be more culturally based than anything. I may be off base here, but in most of the Korean films I've seen there appears to be a shared storyline device that is never spoken aloud or explained Â– almost as if it's assumed to be common knowledge and universally frightening. To make matters worse, I cannot fully explain what this factor might be, just that it *feels* like subtext used to make viewers uneasy. Not to be crass or offensive, I believe this subtext may have something to do with sexuality but that polite Korean culture would frown upon a brazen 'Gozu' style display of the taboo. It may well be that my personal lack of understanding takes away from the power of films like 'Two Sisters.' I mean from all accounts, this flick should have made my skin crawl like 'Ju-On: The Grudge' did, but it didn't. Confused me a little but that was intended and for that I give the screen writers due credit, wowed me with some creative shots of the afore mentioned top-notch cast, but does anyone happen to agree with my taboo subtext theory, or have a similar 'am I missing something' view of the Korean films they've seen? Is anyone else familiar with the folk tale 'Two Sisters' is based upon?HmmmÂ…over analysis of unknown problems is never good. At the end of the day, I have no problem recommending 'Two Sisters' to others as it is a pretty decent flick, if not the best Korean film I have seen to date. However, should they ask if it's scary, I will flatly state I don't consider it a horror movie. More of a 'thinker' that for me had but one truly jolting moment; towards the final sequence we enter a new version of the 'closet' bedroom where Su-yeon had suffered abuse (if not death) at the hands of 'mom' (who may or may not be) the person entering this new, artic-cold version of the room whenÂ…\"Oh Hell! What was that behind the curtains?! Oh man, that got me!Â…maybe they saved up the good stuff for lastÂ…oh, or notÂ…am I missing something ya think? Yeah, you're right, kinda like 'The Eye' without the neato effects ending. Oh well. I mean c'mon, at least it wasn't 'Ring Virus' right?\" ====Final notes of someone up too late: (A) I mentioned The Gudge up there and wanted to be clear that you knew I was talking about Shimizu's original Ju-On version(s). Although it was a decent Western style loud noise jumper, I personally do not consider BuffyGrudge a part of the Ju-On cycle. (But Verbinski's 'Ring' scared the poop outta me - Hideo's 'Ringu' not so much, weird huh!) (B) If you made it this far you must think I am some piece of work - pontificating about some movie I didn't even think was all that great. You'd be partially right, I didn't think it was all that great but don't think it was all that bad either. I mean it could have been a lot worse. I mean you can't honestly tell me you weren't convinced that YOU had been given the cursed video and were going to die a slow, convoluted, needlessly boring death after 30 minutes of 'Ring Virus.' A death as long and pointless as this thing you have just read which will now summon a crawly-girl with long messy hair wearing a slinky nightgown to come eat your cat and free you of your schizo doppelganger using her enchanted cell-phone.Toshio! I choose YOU!Â…a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah-ah-ah-agh-agh-AGH-AGH-AGH-AGH-AGH!'\n",

But after when the horror kicked in, I had to put my nails in my mouth. This is a movie where what you're gonna guess will be completely wrong. It rotates around a broken family, yet you can't describe the situation of family both physically and emotionally. I will not spoil the movie for you.It has the perfect cinematography, The horror is maintained cleanly. Suspense is at every other step. The most captivating thing in this movie is the impeccable timing of music/soundtrack deliveries.If you're going for a out of the line horror movie, then this movie fits. It has a very confusing yet intriguing story-line. You'll have to put all your senses on it and be prepared to jump and don't look down beneath the sink.'\n",

A crappy Japanese (or korean) horror, I thought. I'll watch it alone, no horror can scare me now, I've seen everything. Boy was I wrong...Spoiling the movie for those of you who haven't seen it would be cruel, so I'll just say what was good about it: There are so many layers in the movie. First it scares the crap out of you, then almost makes you cry, and then comes the revelation of what truly happened and the relief. NOTE: There is an excellent guide to read after seeing the movie. It's in the forum section and it's a must for making all those confusing and out-of-place scenes come into their place and click. The movie is directed perfectly. Honestly, some scenes are just breathtakingly beatuful and horrifying at the same time. You will be confused and then rejuvenated when you realize the movie's true value.

There are only a handful of horror movies that have either terrified me or caused a flare of goosebumps (Exorcist, Insidious). However, this movie, which I watched by myself at night, utterly terrified me!!! (I stopped it and had a friend come over the next night to finish it) I maybe vague in details, but it is for your benefit. This is a horror, psychological thriller with more than one twist. Each twist increases in a \"O WOW\" expression. None of the twists ruin the film like in most horror movies. Instead, just when you think its over...Or right when you feel you figured something out...guess again. The scares are not cheap like US films, they can be drawn out, and are highly suspenseful. You will fall in love with the characters and at least care for their well being which is another triumph by the film maker here. Its just one of the most well crafted horror films ever produced (You may ignore The Uninvited, the US remake). And BY GOD its frightening! The movie is not in English, but do not watch it dubbed, the voice acting will ruin the experience. That aside, let the sun set, turn off the lights, and hit play. You are in for a treat from the Orient. BRAVO DIRECTOR, BRAVO!'\n",

In fact, when I began to watch Two Sisters, I did not know at the time it was related to the Uninvited in any way, lol. It wasn't until it really started to show the hostility between Su-mi and the \"step-mom\" that I was like \"Hey... this reminds me of the Uninvited.\" At that point I made the connection about the girls hanging out at the wharf at the beginning of the movie and the similar scene in the Uninvited.My final opinion when the movie was over: A much better piece of art than the Uninvited. Don't get me wrong, I loved the American film, but it really lacked the depth of this Korean original. Also, after watching Two Sisters, I definitely think that A)Su-Mi taking on the personalities of both the sister and the stepmother makes much more sense than the main character in the Uninvited hallucinating ONLY her sister, and no one else (dad or step-mom) in the house notices throughout the entire film. B)The Uninvited goes too much into all that nonsense about the woman who murdered those children who she meets in the mental hospital.'\n",

For instance, I'll start off stating that it's shot beautifully; I don't think anyone can disagree on that aspect. However, the way the story is told is cheaply cagey and the pacing is inconsistent.The resolution is so unbelievable (the step-mother choosing to let the little sister die to get back at a damn child) that it pretty much ruins the credibility of the entire story. The twist that the movie relies on (the delusional older sister) is revealed in a way that makes the setup seem wasteful; having read some of the meanings of the setup scenes, they didn't exactly give the scenes any grace.I'll clarify, I'm not complaining that the delusional angle is trite, I'm simply saying that I didn't think it was well done. Lost Highway is a great example production/direction/storywise of a film that doesn't rely on a specific point in the film to give the rest of it meaning. Don't Look Now is another good one. Images, dialogue (from characters primary and secondary), and context define the exposition (or lack thereof) of those two films yet there is still more to think about after it sinks in.One can actually pinpoint writing and production homages to other films that are neither notable for the fact that they are homages nor helpful in terms of plot direction. I'm pointing specifically to the homages to the Shining (the establishing shots repeated, the camera following a character down a winding hallway, and the mention of the house as an outside entity; the third aspect accounts for unnecessary audience diversion), Audition (an eerily similar prop with blood added, not to mention the use of that prop for an eerily similar jump scare), and yes, The Ring (apparitions with rotting flesh and dark draped hair).'\n",

I felt it was just going to be another Asian horror movie (a string of them have come out in cinema's recently that have all looked identical) but, as I have already stated, I was pleasantly surprised. The only reason I felt obliged to go was because of a review I had read in the excellent Hotdog magazine (5/5). You can tell from the opening that this was not going to be any other horror movie, I mean, how many opening sequences run over wallpaper and seemed interesting? The first couple of scenes really get you into the film, nothing that terrifying, just introductory scenes outlining the characters and showing the viewer the setting. However it is with these scenes that \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" achieves it's brilliance. It is done with such subtly and skill that you can't help but admire the way the director has done it. Not until later do we begin to become entertained by the excellent plot that will not only keep you guessing but actually makes sense in the end (unlike a few other of the latest Asian horror movies. Ju- on: The Grudge anybody?). To describe \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" simply as a horror movie would be an injustice to the director and the movie alike. It's the style and direction of the movie that puts it into a class of it's own. E.g. Towards the end, we have a great moment that wraps the film up nicely, BUT, it's the way that it's handled that put's it above the rest. The soundtrack playing over top of that scene coupled by the directors sense of timing and style just makes the film impossible not to love. The performances from all are top of the line (especially the two sisters) and the relationships between them are so well thought out and acted that you'll never see the end coming.All in all top film (89%)'\n",

            "Review: 'The Unsettling World of Two SistersA Tale of Two Sisters, or Janghwa, Hongryeon as it is known in its native Korea, Is the story of two sisters (no surprises there) named Bae Soo-Mi and Bae Soo-Yeon, who have just been released from a psychiatric hospital and are returned to the care of their loving but distant father and his new wife, the very epitome of the wicked stepmother as far as the girls are concerned. This synopsis alone might give one cause to think 'seen it' and move on. Which just goes to show how woefully inadequate a short synopsis is for this film. The first thing you notice upon watching the film for the first time is how strangely normal everything is for a horror film. The beginning of the story seems to be no more than a display of unhappy families and serves to show us just how much animosity lies between the girls and their new mother-figure. Just when the viewer is beginning to relax and think that this will be a tame horror of the same genre as schlock horror, the tables are turned as a series of unsettling events catch your eye. These are not horrific events by any means, if anything they are merely unknown and half-seen which doesn't sound particularly worrying, but then the mind begins to wander, was that a bird fluttering against a screen or a hand flailing? Is that heavy breathing from someone running towards something or trying to escape from something else? All these and more are left to simmer in the viewer's mind until the out and out horrific images appear, dead people aimlessly wandering the halls in the most un-zombie like fashion, strange fluids dripping from the walls, half-seen creatures disappearing when you turn your head. In other words, A Tale of Two Sisters is a film that comes at you like a dream. Remember those dreams that made you want to leave the light on for the rest of the night? My advice would be to watch this movie during a sleepover or with your partner nearby, as one or both of you will be glad of the company as you try and sleep afterwards despite being scared witless and left reeling by the twist ending. The reason this movie works so well as opposed to its jumpy counterparts is that it doesn't give you a hint that the scares are coming, and then they come slowly, creeping up on you while you wonder if what you're seeing is actually happening. The whole culminates in one big seat-off-your-pants moment that threatens to unhinge your brain completely with the calm way it stalks you, knowing full well that there's no need to rush, it'll be coming for you with every scary moment at its disposal and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

The film just feels thin, and the \"scarier\" moments were too infrequent to have any lasting effect on you. There are several false endings, and the non-linear narrative is interesting, but not particularly inventive.The acting is very good, with the psychotic step-mother taking centre stage. I think the real stars of this film, though, must be the cinematographer and sound designer. The noises pulsated and hummed sinisterly and some of the images and motifs used in the film were very haunting; lavish floral furnishings, sparse Korean landscapes.The film is too much like other eastern horror movies, and despite some infrequent chilling moments, the film is fairly tame.Another film, which I rate higher is \"Gozu\", which is much more gruesome and strange, and definitely worth watching.'\n",

IMO, The Eye has gotten a little more hype than it deserves. Not to say its a bad film, but its not the scariest thing you'll ever see from Asian Horror (like Ringu, Ju-on, Odishon). The elevator and calligraphy scenes provided the scares and the explosive ending helped increase its appeal. But in retrospect, the Eye 2 was a better thriller as Qi Shu portrayed her lead role much better than Angelica Lee. The Eye is okay for 1 viewing. But judge for yourself to see if it lives up to its hype. Note: I'm not exactly sure about a 2007 Cruise's version, and especially the casting choice of Jessica Alba. She's got great screen appeal but not necessarily the range. Maybe Cruise can offer a big budget for scarier couch jumping ghosts.\",\n          \"Simply put, excellent. Scary throughout, entertaining throughout. Would recommend this film to any fan of the horror genre. ESPECIALLY Hitomi's sequence. The elevator and bed scene are both iconic and horrifying. 10/10, watch this scary movie.\",\n          \"I finally got around to seeing this movie last night (Halloween!) and found it enjoyable, but a little disappointing after all that I had heard about it. However I woke up this morning thinking about the plot and feeling genuinely uneasy about the open cupboard door in my bedroom so it definitely did its job to some extent.After checking in here and reading so many reviewers' comparison of this film to 'Videodrome' I'd also like to point out its similarities to a classic old b/w horror called 'Night Of The Demon' (1957). That film features a paper inscribed with runes which will a short time later lead to the horrible death of anyone who finds it in their possession.Similar, then, to the videotape conceit of 'Ringu'; however, the protagonist in 'Night Of The Demon' is highly sceptical of the supernatural and the film follows his gradual conversion as he realises the true horror of the fate that approaches him. Personally I found this idea more interesting and more realistic than the bland acceptance of the supernatural exhibited by the characters in 'Ringu'.So if you enjoyed 'Ringu', check out 'Night Of The Demon', a creaky horror classic! (But steer clear of the US edit re-titled 'Curse Of The Demon', which removed much of the vital exposition.)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          7,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8242886001968468,\n        \"min\": -0.9989,\n        \"max\": 0.9989,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1288,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8405,\n          0.9442,\n          -0.0988\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

IMO, The Eye has gotten a little more hype than it deserves. Not to say its a bad film, but its not the scariest thing you'll ever see from Asian Horror (like Ringu, Ju-on, Odishon). The elevator and calligraphy scenes provided the scares and the explosive ending helped increase its appeal. But in retrospect, the Eye 2 was a better thriller as Qi Shu portrayed her lead role much better than Angelica Lee. The Eye is okay for 1 viewing. But judge for yourself to see if it lives up to its hype. Note: I'm not exactly sure about a 2007 Cruise's version, and especially the casting choice of Jessica Alba. She's got great screen appeal but not necessarily the range. Maybe Cruise can offer a big budget for scarier couch jumping ghosts.\",\n          \"Simply put, excellent. Scary throughout, entertaining throughout. Would recommend this film to any fan of the horror genre. ESPECIALLY Hitomi's sequence. The elevator and bed scene are both iconic and horrifying. 10/10, watch this scary movie.\",\n          \"I finally got around to seeing this movie last night (Halloween!) and found it enjoyable, but a little disappointing after all that I had heard about it. However I woke up this morning thinking about the plot and feeling genuinely uneasy about the open cupboard door in my bedroom so it definitely did its job to some extent.After checking in here and reading so many reviewers' comparison of this film to 'Videodrome' I'd also like to point out its similarities to a classic old b/w horror called 'Night Of The Demon' (1957). That film features a paper inscribed with runes which will a short time later lead to the horrible death of anyone who finds it in their possession.Similar, then, to the videotape conceit of 'Ringu'; however, the protagonist in 'Night Of The Demon' is highly sceptical of the supernatural and the film follows his gradual conversion as he realises the true horror of the fate that approaches him. Personally I found this idea more interesting and more realistic than the bland acceptance of the supernatural exhibited by the characters in 'Ringu'.So if you enjoyed 'Ringu', check out 'Night Of The Demon', a creaky horror classic! (But steer clear of the US edit re-titled 'Curse Of The Demon', which removed much of the vital exposition.)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          7,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8242886001968468,\n        \"min\": -0.9989,\n        \"max\": 0.9989,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1288,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8405,\n          0.9442,\n          -0.0988\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentymenttttt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -1,\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

IMO, The Eye has gotten a little more hype than it deserves. Not to say its a bad film, but its not the scariest thing you'll ever see from Asian Horror (like Ringu, Ju-on, Odishon). The elevator and calligraphy scenes provided the scares and the explosive ending helped increase its appeal. But in retrospect, the Eye 2 was a better thriller as Qi Shu portrayed her lead role much better than Angelica Lee. The Eye is okay for 1 viewing. But judge for yourself to see if it lives up to its hype. Note: I'm not exactly sure about a 2007 Cruise's version, and especially the casting choice of Jessica Alba. She's got great screen appeal but not necessarily the range. Maybe Cruise can offer a big budget for scarier couch jumping ghosts.\",\n          \"Simply put, excellent. Scary throughout, entertaining throughout. Would recommend this film to any fan of the horror genre. ESPECIALLY Hitomi's sequence. The elevator and bed scene are both iconic and horrifying. 10/10, watch this scary movie.\",\n          \"I finally got around to seeing this movie last night (Halloween!) and found it enjoyable, but a little disappointing after all that I had heard about it. However I woke up this morning thinking about the plot and feeling genuinely uneasy about the open cupboard door in my bedroom so it definitely did its job to some extent.After checking in here and reading so many reviewers' comparison of this film to 'Videodrome' I'd also like to point out its similarities to a classic old b/w horror called 'Night Of The Demon' (1957). That film features a paper inscribed with runes which will a short time later lead to the horrible death of anyone who finds it in their possession.Similar, then, to the videotape conceit of 'Ringu'; however, the protagonist in 'Night Of The Demon' is highly sceptical of the supernatural and the film follows his gradual conversion as he realises the true horror of the fate that approaches him. Personally I found this idea more interesting and more realistic than the bland acceptance of the supernatural exhibited by the characters in 'Ringu'.So if you enjoyed 'Ringu', check out 'Night Of The Demon', a creaky horror classic! (But steer clear of the US edit re-titled 'Curse Of The Demon', which removed much of the vital exposition.)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          7,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8242886001968468,\n        \"min\": -0.9989,\n        \"max\": 0.9989,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1288,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8405,\n          0.9442,\n          -0.0988\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
