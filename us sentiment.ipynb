For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2/10\",\n          \"9/10\",\n          \"5/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2/10\",\n          \"9/10\",\n          \"5/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8258673021055793,\n        \"min\": -0.9994,\n        \"max\": 0.9995,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2513,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9974,\n          -0.9955,\n          -0.9688\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Review: '\"The Ring\" is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film \"Ringu\", which in turn was based on the 1991 book. The story revolves around a VHS tape that is cursed: whoever watches it will die in seven days. A reporter (Naomi Watts) catches wind of it and watches the video. She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.Shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), \"The Ring\" is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain. Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.Unfortunately, the back story of the ghostly girl is convoluted and too much is left unexplained (Why do horses go nuts on two occasions? Why is the little girl evil? Where did she come from? And the chronology of the back-story is hard to figure out), but maybe the answers are there if you rack your brains. I'll do that the next time I watch the film.Another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling. This is important to me because ghost flicks normally bore me. After all, what can an immaterial ghost do to you anyway? Not much except maybe make objects fly in a whirlwind of negative energy. So what's to be scared of? They're dead and can't do any significant harm. \"The Ring\" effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful. Other films have followed suit, like 2004's \"The Grudge\" and it's sequels.Speaking of subsequent films, many of them have taken elements of \"The Ring\" and made better films, at least as far as the story goes; for instance, the excellent \"From Within\" (2008). But it's hard to beat the mysterious ambiance of \"The Ring.\" Some complain about one or two false endings, but the movie couldn't end without revealing what killed the girl in the opening teaser.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: B'\n",

Also because of Naomi Watts whose performance in 'Mulholland Drive' was awesome (here she was nothing special). The script and the reviews suggested that it was a great freaky horror but to me it was simply boring. There wasn't a single scene that frightened me. The storyline was flat, there wasn't anything at all to make you think of or remember this movie, there was no message, no point. The characters were boring as well with an average acting, they didn't make you worry/care about them if they die. I blame the director for that. The only good things were some nice shots and and the sounds. The fake ending was so stupid, it's only purpose being to leave the story open for a 2nd part, which I won't see for sure. 3/10'\n",

            "Review: 'The Ring (2002): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Amber Tamblyn: The title doesn't really represent what the film is about. It is beautifully crafted with dazzling production values and intriguing plot setup that somehow falls deep in the well of despair by its conclusion. It is a mind exercise about a video tape that kills its viewers after seven days from initial viewing. How it does this is never explained, and we never learn who's voice it is on the other end of the phone. Fear Dot Com had a similar idea that was even worse. It opens with the death of a teenage girl whose face is masked in terror. Naomi Watts plays a single mother and journalist who seeks answers and tension rises when she ends up viewing the tape in order to move on with the case. She seeks help from her ex-husband, a video processor who also views it. Directed by Gore Verbinski who has done worse than this. He made The Mexican as well as a wretched little number called Mouse Hunt. Here he is backed by visual elements and creative plot turns that fail to make sense of it all. Naomi Watts holds her own while Martin Henderson is effective in his collaboration. David Dorfman as her son fears that he too is at risk. Other roles are not as broad or are just plain strange. The film contains visually striking images that add to the film's pointless and warped presentation. Score: 5 ½ / 10'\n",

A good plot line, a reasonably good amount of emotion from the characters and amazing camera works are just a few of the things that make this film so exceptional.If you ask me, the movie is frightening, not scary. It doesn't make you want to scream and run away while watching it. It just sends a shiver down your spine which I wouldn't say gave me a nightmare. It doesn't give you any cheap thrills but goes on with a vague presence of death and terror all along.The movie may seem a bit incomplete to a few people because the making of the Tape was never shown or even hinted towards. But I quite liked that part of the movie. Humans have been fascinated by the thought of ghosts from ages ago. We don't know how they work or what makes them tick. So withholding that bit of information from the audience is a well thought out idea.I could give the movie a 8 or 7, mostly due to it's overly clichéd general outlook of it. But I suppose I'd just be lying to myself if I said that I didn't watch it at least 6 times. So, I award it a perfect 10.'\n",

Although the film does contain horror elements, it is more of an adventure mystery thriller. I enjoyed the unraveling of a mystery aspect, and discovering how all the pieces fit together.

Sometimes its impossible to talk about either film - the Japanese version or the US remake without comparing them such is the division of opinion. Taking The Ring on its own merits though it is a chilling and seriously creepy film.However if you have watched the Japanese version then some parts of the Ring will frustrate you. Such as the insistence US film makers have you holding your hand and explaining everything to you every step of the way. What ever happened to less is more? A big reason why Ring was so scary is that you knew next to nothing about the female apparition Sadako and this lent her an air of mystery. Here in The Ring we see her as a little girl sitting up and talking in bed. Not very scary. Also the main part - the video itself is just too well done in the US Ring. It looks more like a student art house film then a manifestation of evil. The Japanese version was darker, dirtier and plain freakier. As was the music.Don't get me wrong. The US Ring is still a fantastic horror film which improves on the Japanese version is some areas - just not overall. because of that its kind of impossible to say which was actually better. I personally prefer the original for the reasons I listed, but each to their own.After promising myself I wouldn't spend this comment comparing the two its obvious I need to go punish myself in some way.

What I actually mean is that 'The Ring' is an unpleasant artistic experience, and this despite being actually well filmed. The director seems to be one of these technically skilled people, capable of taking a story and translating it into good cinematography. The problem is that the story has no logic, time is badly manipulated, there is no emotion to connect the viewers to the guys supposed to be good in the story, and frankly not enough thrill to make this a memorable horror film. The end which is suppose to explain what this was all about (need it?) is kind of a ridiculous joke, imported from the 'Gothic' stories.

            "Review: 'Of course different tastes will cause some people to feel differently about different films. I think The Ring is quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time, and needless to say my favorite or at the very least top three. Horror films, and I have seen hundreds, tend to lack extreme intelligence, they can be campy, crazy, senseless but still fun to watch. The Ring doesn't even fall into that category. Instead the American remake of the Japanese Ringu (also brilliantly made) is one of the most intelligent horrific and terrifying movies in existence. It doesn't just frighten, it gets under the skin and terrifies.The Ring is the story of a reporter named Rachel Keller, who's niece and three of her teenage friends quite suddenly die, their heart just stops. Rachel speaks to several people at her niece's funeral and discovers that many of them believe in an urban legend of a killer video tape that supposedly her niece and friends had watched. Rachel is determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths and goes to the place where her niece supposedly saw this tape, an inn in the mountains. She finds the unmarked tape, and not believing the legend pops it in and is instantly caught in a downward spiral, no pun intended, of a mysterious, terrifying mystery. Suddenly a believer of the legend she calls her ex-boyfriend (possibly husband) and father of her son who is some sort of a video expert and shows it to him. He doesn't believe the stories at all until he gradually begins to realize he too is dying. They desperately piece together the clues from the killer video tape but not before their son, Aidan, accidentally gets hold of the tape and watches it as well. Now they're not only fighting for their lives but the life of their son. They uncover a horrible curse that started with an adopted daughter of a man and woman who were horse breeders. It seemed that the woman murdered her daughter after losing her mind. Despite the fact that they seemingly have figured out the mystery, they've got it all wrong and the evil won't go away.How incredibly easy it would be for a plot like this to do one of two things. 1. Become so incredibly confusing that it would be hard to follow and make no sense or 2. be completely cut and edited to shreds to \"dumb it down\" for the movie going public. Somehow, brilliantly, Gore Verbinsky managed to do neither. The film fits together perfectly, and leaves so much open to discussion, imagination, or further stories of this deadly curse. The cast is all around brilliant. Naomi Watts, who until this film I would have figured not a good enough actress to pull off such an emotional role is so excellent as Rachel. She shows confidence, fear, and breakdown all at once. Her boyfriend played by Martin Henderson is equally as great in his role and their relationship is handled with dignity and charisma. And huge hats off to young David Dorfman who plays Watts' son Aidan. Dorfman's character is diverse and very strange. He seems to carry a connection with the evil Samara, and perhaps has some sort of abilities himself. He is much more grown up than he appears. Dorfman engulfs this role and is just startling and creepy and adds to the mood. He does a great job. So why is The Ring so great?? It's terrifying, that's why. This is done first and foremost by brilliant writing, the story itself is terrifying. But Verbinsky also created a very dull, Grey, rainy, dark setting that is constant and never breaks for comedy or \"lighten up.\" The killer video itself sends shivers down your spine and you finish the movie wondering if your phone is gonna ring with a proclamation of \"SEVEN DAYS!\" As in the original Japanese film, the time line is fast paced and you feel the anxiousness knowing they only have a short time to solve the mystery. The Ring is genuinely creepy and I don't suggest ever watching it alone. But I do suggest anyone a fan of remakes or horror or suspense, you MUST MUST own The Ring. I cannot wait another minute to see the follow up. There is so much more to this franchise!! HUGE 10 out of 10'\n",

            "Review: 'First, it's important to know that this movie is an American remake of the Japanese 1998 film, Ring (which I'll call by its literal title Ringu for this review), which is itself based on the novel of the same name by Koji Suzuki. The critical and commercial success of The Ring brought in a whole slew of remakes of J-Horror movies, like Dark Water, Pulse, One Missed Call, and most successfully, Ju-On The Grudge(both the original and remake are quite good, though the original is perhaps a little better). And this is a remake that outshines the original.The plot is simple; Rachel, played by Naomi Watts and her ex-husband Noah, played by Martin Henderson, have a week to answer the mystery of a cursed videotape, which has claimed the lives of several teenagers. Telling anymore spoils the mystery, which is the heart of the movie. A fair bit of it is different from Ringu, but for the majority, these changes are far better for the movie. The intrigue of the tape and it's background is the real grip of the movie. The contents of the tape itself are incredibly disturbing, and at first appear as a seemingly random string of images. Each little piece gets slowly revealed to the viewer, and you begin to piece it all together, without the film telling it all to you. You solve the mystery and are invested in it just as much as our heroes. And thankfully, these heroes are excellently played. Watts performance of Rachel is a grounded, level-headed, and intuitive one, making Rachel a sleuth in all but name. Henderson brings some much-needed humour to the earlier parts of the movie before the horror starts to creep in, but soon reveals a versatile and human nature to Noah. Brian Cox (without saying too much) also has a few unfortunately brief, but powerful scenes, that bring real gravity to the situation. Our villain probably has less than 15 minutes of screen time, but her presence is constantly felt throughout the last half. The other actors aren't all that much to write home about however. They're far from bad, but instead feel only like links to where the plot will take the mystery, or to tell you about some dark event. The Ring is a great balance of mystery and horror. While Ringu perhaps focused too much on the mystery, and could only scare you a handful of times, The Ring has scares spaced out sporadically to keep you on your toes. There are jump scares, but a lot of the terror is from what you don't see. As mentioned earlier, you constantly feel the villain's presence, just breathing on the back of your neck. The soundtrack is unnerving, and the music that you would expect to play in the calmer moments is distorted, just to remind you that things are never safe. Two scenes in particular start with an almost mundane scenario, and soon escalate to something nightmarish (one of them I had to pause the movie for a few minutes).Now to air out a few of the bad things, but these are almost petty. The child actors are...well, child actors. They're not amazing. But for what they have to do, they do it well enough. Much of the film also has a green hue to it, but I suspect this was because it came out no long after the Matrix, and being green was the thing. Viewers may also find parts of it quite confusing. I saw Ringu and read the book before seeing this, so I knew the plot fairly well, but I can understand anyone's confusion. The Ring is a fantastic film, combining elements of a classic mystery and psychological horror. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout/ The Ring eclipses Ringue in my opinion, though I know many who might disagree. Ringu worked really well for a book. But The Ring works even better as a movie. If you like a good mystery, some unknown terror, or just watching a good movie, The Ring is one of my highest recommendations.'\n",

The original, although not a unique idea, is a very interesting one if handled right. It was a very watchable horror, nothing special, but well worth a view.The remake however it a shambles. It takes a few good ideas from the film it is remaking, and also borrows from many other Hollywood horrors. The two films show the difference between the cinema from continent to continent. Japanese cinema is far more artistic and its audience view the films in a far different way. I can not imagine many traditional Japanese audiences enjoying Gore Verbinski's film.It has a few redeeming points. The special effects, as you would expect go some way to making the Hollywood version watchable, but as for the plot, it makes little sense, and we are simply not interested enough to unravel the bits that need us to.The usual horror conventions of the jump effect loud music are implmenented as the only way to scare us in this horror.

            "Review: '18 October 2002. I can't really describe The Ring as a horror movie, it's more like a mystery thriller with a paranormal twist. Unlike the average horror movie, this movie takes a much more serious tone, using little violence and gore. The movie wasn't that scary, but instead it contained a continuous undertone of heavy-leadened dread, like a nightmare from which you can't wake up. There were a number of excellent moments of fright, well done, suspenseful. On the whole, the movie was consistent in its plot, made reasonable sense and had a good twist at the end. There were also some exotic, original images (reminiscent of good indpendent movies). While the movie would have been even better if it could have scared us as much as a creepy Blair Witch Project, it had an even better intelligent storyline and emotional undertone. Movie's ultimate resolution, however, was implicitedly unsettling for those of the audience that think the whole storyline through, perhap even repulsive. Eight out of ten.'\n",

The reviews talked about a must see movie. How wrong they all were. I was slapping myself all true the movie and as the story progressed got more and more annoyed with the whole thing.  Then I saw the ace actor Brian Cox and thought that maybe he could raise the level of the movie a bit. But he saw that there was no saving this movie and he quickly killed off his character in a very very strange way.  This was just one of the things that does not make any sense. This remake loses the steady pace Ringu and adds all kinds of things I still don't know what these added to the story.  What was that with the horses? Why does the kid think he sees dead people (pun intended)? Horrible movie, watch Ringu and Ringu 2 (a few scenes of which also end up in this remake adding more confusion) instead.'\n",

This scared the crap out of me, and i thought the effects were awesome, plus the finale was great!. Both This and The original Japense version Ringu are extremely scary, and i think this is one of the best American remakes ever!, plus i thought it was brilliantly written as well. Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson had excellent chemistry together, and the character development was very good, plus David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase are both extremely creepy as the kids. The opening is one of the scariest things i have ever seen, and it was constantly unpredictable, plus the images were quite frightening!. This is quite simply one of the scariest movies i have ever seen, simply brilliant in all aspects (in my opinion), and i say drop what your doing immediately and go see it!. The Direction is brilliant!. Gore Verbinski does a brilliant job here, with jaw dropping camera work, fantastic use of colors, constantly adding scary atmosphere, creating very scary images, great angles, and keeping the film extremely scary throughout!. There is a tiny bit of blood and gore, but this movie is not really bout that. We get lots of creepy images, very scary disfigured faces,fingers cut on glass,tongue vomited out,nail through finger,bloody nose bleeds,bunch of severed fingers, melting corpse, and other minor stuff. The Acting is amazing!. Naomi Watts is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! and is AMAZING as usual. She is extremely likable, vulnerable, had excellent chemistry with Martin Henderson, was constantly on top of things, was intense, and really gave a stellar show! (Naomi Rules!). Martin Henderson is excellent here, he is also extremely likable, had excellent chemistry with Naomi Watts, had a good sense of humor, and just did an excellent job overall!. David Dorfman is great and very creepy as the son, his eyes really gave me the creeps, and did what he was required to do extremely well!. Brian Cox is great and very intense in his cameo, he was awesome!. Daveigh Chase gives a very memorable performance as Samara and scared the crap out of me big time!, the scene where she walks in from the TV, is one of the creepiest things you will see (a little scarier in Ringu, but it still scared me very much!). Shannon Cochran was great in her scenes as the mother, i liked her lots. Amber Tamblyn Rachael Bella were both hot, and did there jobs well. Rest of the cast do awesome. Overall Go see this immediately, it's one of the scariest films i have ever seen!. ***** out of 5'\n",

            "Review: 'The Ring (2002) is far better than the Japanese original. Now this isn't to say that this movie is good (it isn't), but to say that it's simply better than Ringu.The story is very similar to the original movie however it has slight changes. Obviously the names have been westernized and the locations are also slightly different. But for all the differences much of this movie is the exact same. Now this isn't normally a negative as this movie is a remake of the one i'm calling it similar too. However i rate the original so poorly that i would have liked a slightly different take on the story. Now it does have changes (especially towards the end), however they're not enough to call it completely different. If you have seen the original the story is similar (although slightly better in my opinion). If you haven't then i will sum it up like this. It's not a very good story even for horror, but it isn't unwatchable either.The horror in this movie is done better than the original but not by leaps and bounds. I think the opening scare and the scares that occur throughout the movie are just done better and hit harder. Now i still (like the original) believe that this movie is not scary at all, however it is far better in this department than the original. This isn't a compliment to this movie but more of a negative towards the original. If you want to be scared and/or creeped out then this movie isn't for you.The CGI and what seemed to be prosthetics were pretty good in this movie. Nothing to blow you away but i feel it did enough to sell the premise to me (although the premise itself didn't). Here it gets an average score as although it isn't at all bad and at times is decent, it's a very small part of this movie.Story - 2.5/10Horror - 3.5/10CGI/Visuals - 5/10Overall a pretty poor movie but compared to the original a masterpiece, 3/10.'\n",

            "Review: 'The idea that you watch a video tape, receive a phone call and then die within a week of engaging in these two events is an interesting idea but at the same time, not that scary  what is it that's going to cause you to die that is so scary you can't get medical or authoritarian help? But that's what The Ring is; a film that doesn't rely on character logistics or 'what should be done in that situation' but rather relies on eeriness and uncanny things to get across its scares.I will not deny that The Ring is scary because it is a very unnerving and creepy film  although there's no violence or gore, I was still finding myself looking away from the screen once or twice but I realised afterwards that this was due to the fact I had absolutely no idea what it was I was dealing with in the film. If you were to make a ten second film of someone opening a creaky old door, going inside to a pitch black room whilst all the time having eerie music playing over the events and really dark lighting over the images, you'll probably find your audience looking away merely because they don't know who any one is, why what's happening IS happening and what's going to pop out at them. This is The Ring to a tee.The Ring is a horror film that takes a detective route and the character of Rachel Keller (Watts) takes on the detective role in a rather tired way. The introduction to the video tape in question is a very brief and rather crude way of setting up the events  no, I don't believe that fate would have one girl mention 'the tape' literally minutes before the other girl would succumb to its curse and no, I don't believe that characters at the funeral would be able to free roam their way through the bedroom where the death happened since it should be a crime scene, but there is no help in the form of authoritarian figures, remember? This is a world without police and the FBI to investigate strange occurrences which is ironic because at times, The Ring does feel like an episode of The X Files.Once it's established that this tape exists, The Ring turns into a film that relies on its breaking of everyday rules to crank up suspense. I mentioned the bedroom/crime scene occurrence which shouldn't have even happened because people wouldn't have been allowed up there. Also, the car ferry scene where a horse bolts from its carriage due to Keller's presence; again, it shouldn't have happened because once a car ferry starts moving, passengers aren't allowed on the car deck. As it was, that scene was self-motivated by the character of Keller (who could've stepped away when the horse got agitated) and turned out to be rather unpleasant.The film consists of Keller and her sidekick Noah Clay (Henderson) attempting to solve the case of the tape whilst avoiding the uncanny events that happen in-between every now and again. These include the horse/ferry scene, the taking of a fly from the video, nose bleeds, flashing images from the video itself and a creepy Sixth Sense-come-Omen type male child who the film relies on to get most of the uncomfortable atmosphere across; needless to say it works but on a basic level. Why anything's actually scary in The Ring is because you will not have too much of an idea to what is going on. The confusing plot that only really becomes clear in the final fifteen minutes merely toils on your mind more and more as each eerie scene goes past being able to cope with the scares and with the working out of the plot is hard work. The fact the film makers have a license to include just about anything in the form of scares doesn't help too much.I found the finale of the film a little disturbing but only because Keller involves her child in a way that I didn't think was necessary in fact The Ring ends rather downbeat and more like a tragedy when it becomes clear what the motivation of the tape actually is. The Ring has its scares and maybe two jumps at the most but this is very much a case of seen it - don't need to see it again.'\n",

But for true Horror fans this may be cheating.When I first watched \"The Ring\" in the theater I thought it was boring, dull, and cheap. Over the years I've watched it on cable and even on local t.v. My opinion hasn't changed notably.Sure, this is an American remake but it goes too far on the CGI aspect and the Hollywood clichès. I mean, the original \"Ringu\" was creepy and started the craziness for ghost children in Horror.The American remake exploits the Samara factor to the point that it is cheap, non-scary, an even laughable. For those who haven't seen the original, this version may fit for ghost revenge tastes but forget about suspense or true scare scenes. Sure, the final scene involving Samara coming out of T.V. and chasing some guy is candy for the eye but still it's a lame scene.Enough with remakes and CGI abuse.

            "Review: 'Perhaps the most successful of the American remakes of Japanese horror features, The Ring is also a landmark for the careers of director Gore Verbinski, who, thanks to this success, gained carte blanche to develop the initial Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy (2003-2006 -2007), and actress Naomi Watts, in her first work after the acclaimed City of Dreams (2001), and whose good performance here opened the possibility of being nominated for an Oscar the following year, for 21 Grams (2003). The positive reception, however, opened Hollywood's doors to a flurry of eastern horror remakes, all with far lesser results. It was a time of cultural fervor in the horror genre, with news from all possible corners, giving the Americans the creation of a label called J-Horror, or Japanese Horror, a genre of Japanese culture that is at the base of the films mentioned in the previous paragraph , as well as in the various remakes made after the rise of Samara, characters inspired by Sadako, from the film starting point, Ringu, directed by Hideo Nakata, a creature who managed to found his own mythology in American territory, with positive results, both in aesthetics as in the dramatic issues that lead us to contextual debates and reflections.One of the greatest merits of this film is the construction of the narrative, director Gore Verbinski delivers a horror story that does not resort to the typical easy scares (so hot lately), the fear is precisely in the tension, in the gloomy climate that narrows down to reach the great climax. Verbinski already shocks us with that wonderful opening scene, which in a way reminds us of the equally great opening of the classic Scream. From there, the script goes to the investigation plot, which by the way is very well worked and which gradually reveals the secrets surrounding that tape.Verbinski's elegant driving and Watts' safe driving as the protagonist give The Ringa differentiator - something that not even its sequels (The Ring2, 2005, and The Ring3, 2017) have managed to maintain. He was given a detailed development of a supernatural story with detective touches and a final twist that appealed to the public, all taken by surprise by a curse that was just beginning - thus ensuring its sequels. She was already responsible for introducing a female figure that not only emits cries for help at every scare. On the contrary, she is not only responsible for her actions but also for those whom she ends up affecting in the course of her actions. She is a mature, confident woman who is not afraid of haunting her path.The script by Ehren Krueger, playwright who reorganizes an already structured text, having as its function the complex task of cultural translation. Thus, the dialogues change, as do the characters' actions. There is, between the two mothers of both narratives, basically the same dramatic need. Keeping yourself unscathed for the sake of your children. It is a theme that works within what is conventionally called \"universal\", a general idea that reaches east and west. In the American version, by the way, realism is also present. Rachel is the protagonist, but she behaves like any other human being, full of flaws that characterize her as a normal woman, full of imperfections. Rachel is intense but not perfect. She is a relapsed mother and with a strange relationship with little Aidan, a silent and sad boy, a kind of mirror image of Samara Morgan, responsible for the curse of the video. A journalist for a print media, she has no qualms when the need for the scoop or the answers to save her life speak louder than the values established by what people call \"ethics\", with the good thing about it all, the form how such characters circulate in the spaces conceived by the aesthetic elements of the story.The ghostly atmosphere is complex, as evil is mediated, as in a criticism of television. This becomes apparent when Rachel visits Samara's father's farm and in an argument, he vents her opinion about the media professionals: \"What do reporters want? They take someone's tragedy and spread it like a disease\". There is a scene where Rachel watches the neighboring building and all the visible apartments have their televisions on, with people doing the most diverse activities. In an era of depression and loneliness, television has become the silent and ubiquitous relative. The TV is Samara's portal, part of a scheme to destroy our brain molecules, as pointed out by two characters in the opening. And what about the family? Without the common standards established by traditional society that has been crumbling for eons, here we find a mother who must work hard to support her child, without the proper help of the omnipresent and irresponsible father. The search for motherhood seems to be a theme that tries to emerge in the narrative fabric of the work.Another positive point of the film that gained immense repercussion was the figure of Samara, the cursed girl who is responsible for a wave of deaths - and which the protagonists try to avoid. The hairy little girl determined to make them pay for all the harm she suffered in life has become a popular icon, not only being generically repeated in later similar titles, but also surrendering to self-parody - all the fear that inspires this chapter The initial opening ends up being reduced to an uninspired pastiche in the following episode. Samara was abandoned by her natural parents, adopted by a couple who do not understand her, and left to die at the bottom of a well for exactly one week. After these seven days, she returns, now to get revenge through an obscure recording found on a dusty VHS tape. Whoever watches it, immediately receives a phone call: on the other end of the line, a female child's voice says only \"seven days\".\"The Ring\", interestingly, makes no mystery about the content of the tape (a series of dreamlike, seemingly meaningless images), which is presented to the viewer as the protagonist, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts -the blonde from \"City of Dreams\") sees her. This creates a curious complicity between the audience and the character. Both, after all, are in the condition of passive spectators, with unvirgined and cursed eyes, which facilitates the unfolding of the plot, which follows Rachel's saga to unravel the film's message, the only chance to save her life and that of her son.The film draws attention to its team's brutal effort to create an atmosphere. As in the successful \"The Others\", there is no room for ironies or jokes here. Everything in the film is very serious, rigorously thought out to the smallest details, and its look is treated absolutely differently from the average Hollywood production today. Photography at this point helps a lot in the mood, the director opts for palettes in greyish and bluish tones and this combined with the often rainy and closed weather makes the scenes denser, more dramatic and somber, besides, of course, giving a finish and a better aesthetic than the narrative. Despite the photograph full of shades of gray, striking images to the point of recreating the damned video in the film itself, and a game of disagreements proposed by the script between what is supernatural or just impression, the most interesting of this The Ring ends up being, in a closer analysis, the family issues that are raised. Samara just wanted to be loved, and no one around her is willing to make that effort. Yes, it takes dedication and commitment to take care of a child, as we learned in the complicated relationship between Aidan and his parents, Rachel (whom he refuses to call \"mother\") and Noah (whose identity is not even assumed). It's an interesting parallel, which perhaps deserves a closer look, but which still, in the format in which it is delivered to the public, manages to go beyond mere cliché.As a curiosity, there are several tributes to the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, in sequences with references to his classic films such as Psycho (1960), in the passage where there is water running down the bathroom drain when Rachel is taking a shower (in a reference to the famous scene from shower murder), or Rear Window (1954), through Rachel's building neighbor, who is watching television sitting in an armchair with a broken leg (recalling James Stewart's similar character, who liked to watch his neighbors with a telescope). Other curious facts were the quick appearance of images of subtle circles of varying sizes throughout the film, a clear reference to the cursed video symbol, and the absence of actor Chris Cooper, who had filmed some scenes as a child murderer and was cut into the final edit.The Ring is one of those rare exceptional thrillers that, unlike most productions of its kind, doesn't need to rely on overt violence to make an impact. On the contrary, the ubiquitous tense atmosphere of the production ensures audience interest throughout the duration of the tape. Such atmosphere is achieved by the competent work of Bojan Bazelli (photography), Hans Zimmer (soundtrack) and Gore Verbinski (director), in perfect harmony, aided by the excellent editing of Craig Wood. The tightly tied conclusion also provides a natural hook for the sequel to this intriguing film that deserves the attention of fans of the genre, and regardless of the veracity of the approach to an urban legend in a cursed video, it's always good to remember the words of sensitive boy Aidan, when worried he told his mother about Samara's vengeful ghost: Don't you understand, Rachel? She never sleeps...'\n",

            "Review: 'Spoiler free, no specific actions or character details givenThe Ring will entertain you fully and you will have no unanswered questions if you accept anything that is thrown at you and never stop to ponder even the simplest details.Okay, there's a videotape that kills people after they watch it. A little girl is involved. We know that, but there's unanswered questions. Well, the movie does give you answers, which are satisfying as long as you don't ask a single follow-up question. If I want to know why some angry kid went on a shooting spree at school, the local news will give me the answers why. Instead, \"The Ring\" IS that troubled kid. For any question I ask, be it \"how did this happen?\" or \"why?\", the answer is a basic, uninspired \"uhh, because\". He may even give me an answer that he thinks makes perfect sense such as \"I want to kill people so I got a gun and did\". And of course, if that's all you ever heard of the case, and no other explanation were given for the series of questions that would follow, you'd be completely satisfied, right? Well, not for most people, but then here you have the Ring which pulls that crap with almost every important question you'd have. Yes, you learn how this video kills people, as demonstrated in one of the two \"big reveals\" of the film that is so powerful and scary that I think \"Oh,\" and shrug. The other big reveal a is red herring near the end that's just a bit of dialog - basically \"Uh oh, what we thought was the case really isn't, and now it's actually worse!\" The film ruins this too, giving no explanation, reasoning or motive whatsoever for what was just explained. Savin' it for the sequel I guess.The end made me realize that, more than anything, I could have summed up this film in one sentence and saved myself a lot of time and letdown. Yes there's a little girl, a well, and a mysterious video that kills people. But why, how, and what do they all have to do with each other? Well, the big \"why\" is revealed without much more than \"well, uh, because\". \"How\" isn't answered at all- not in any logical, explainable way unless you just accept the very silly and ostensibly MEGA CHILLING super payoff that I think I was supposed to have seen. Of course, after seeing what I saw, I'd still like to know \"how\" that event, upon which this movie's very premise hangs, is possible. No explanation attempted. You just buy it, 'cuz it makes the story super neato, you know?As for \"what do they all have to do with each other?\" Well, the movie goes on for an eternity trying to make this the big mystery. In fact, if I gave you the answers to what happens, then went into detail of how this is visually represented, you'd probably think there'd have to be SOMETHING more going on, and probably say \"oh, that's what happens? How? Why? (there's those troublesome words again).Nope, there ain't much of a story here. It's a concept that, when stripped down, comes down to a special effect, one that has different motives than what we were led to believe. Huh, pretty powerful I guess, or so I'm supposed to think based on the Sixth Sense \"slowly zoom in on the character as they reveal the 'big twist'\" shot. I mean, sure I know that the movie's last ten minutes are supposed to be pretty profound and I'm not supposed to question it. I suppose it's just the natural learner in me that says \"Gee, now I know the big secret. The video kills people by doing what I just saw. What again is the motive for this, how again does it work through a plastic videotape, and why does it take 100 minutes of buildup for the basic or nonexistent answers I received? Huh, what? Distract me with the end credits and release a couple answers on a special edition DVD released in time for the sequel? Sure, sounds great.To make matters worse, no one in the movie is appealing. The protagonist is a pest and a (expletive). In addition to other annoyances, she's rude enough to walk up to someone's horse, let it out of its cage, and watch its resultant gory death as its little girl owner cries in horror, all without a word of apology or explanation. I can also ponder credibility leaps like how she can be holding a dessicated corpse while up to her waist in putrid water and not think too much of it.Of course I'll get a personal message ridiculing my stupidity. How dare I try to find logic in a film that, as a horror film, shouldn't apply to logic? It's simple. I got the film, got the message. But you know, after two hours and all that praise, I expected a better ending than that, or at least some explanation beyond \"it's just magical. Accept it.\" Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a horror film too, but Leatherface didn't kill people by popping out of a tree and making his chainsaw hover at his victims. If a movie isn't going to bother being realistic, it should at least give a better explanation than this film did.But hey, this movie is the perfect conformist's exercise. Everyone else loves it, so surely I must be stupid if I don't. I guess I need to just watch it and accept it, not asking any questions or pointing out flaws in the story since that's clearly what everyone else has done. Then once I'm done with that I can go and love Blair Witch instead of actually wondering what it was on the screen that I was supposed to be terrified of.'\n",

Naomi Watts provides an excellent performance, with a decent supporting cast. The film's pacing for the most part is quite fantastic. One of the films only problems is its cliche filled beginning, used to set up the film's plot itself.

In the end, The Ring is a well made remake that is both incredibly entertaining, refreshingly original, and provides a great performance from Naomi Watts.\n",

            "Review: 'A review I have read prepared me for a bad movie; but THE RING is not bad at all . It's very scary, creepy . It is true that it's only mechanically scary; it can be conceded that the supernatural remains exterior and that the note of the movie is very tonic, like that of a suspense action movie. The most creepy character was the small boy; the most inexpressive was Watts' husband.The atmosphere is purely natural, and, when the scene is not scary, is that of a tonic suspense movie. I guess this in-aptitude for conveying the supernatural must have disappointed those who dismiss the movie as failed; and this, I can concedeTHE RING is not a bad movie, but a failed one. It utterly fails to achieve a supernatural thriller. All the supernatural remains exterior and mechanical.Given the otherworldly plot, the movie's note is very mundane and basically secure and tonic. Like a wholly _movieish suspense romp; as I doubt that Verbinski meant otherwise, the movie is conventionally welldone. If confronted to its own premise, anyway, and not to the director's intentions, it's failed.Verbinski did not flop; he has skills, he is deft; and his mistake being as subtle as it is also obvious, I doubt he would understand what it was. His version is a 'desupernaturalization of the Oriental movie(s).'\n",

            "Review: 'I'll be completely honest, this movie was not as good as I expected it to be, even though it features a worthy performance by Naomi Watts. The acting really comes through and shines, but if you take the movie as a whole, then it doesn't quite measure up to my own personal standards of horror films. The plot is interesting, watch the weird/creepy video tape, you receive a phone call saying \"7 days\" in a very low hushed creepy tone of voice. And this of course means that you will in some way die when those next 7 days are up. Naomi Watts's character is trying desperately to figure out why people around her have died from watching this tape and where the tape originated from, what it's background is and how it has these powers to kill. The movie drags in some places, and then it can be thrilling in other places. The big issue I had with the movie was that it just wasn't scary. There wasn't a single moment I thought what was happening was frightening, and that of course is not good for a horror movie. But the reason the rating isn't lower is really just because the lead performance by Watts is so good. 5/10 overall for The Ring (2002). There are better scary flicks out there.'\n",

            "Review: 'I haven't seen the original Japanese version of this film, so i was able to watch the film without having to compare it to Ringu. As a result i quite liked this film. I found it to be genuinely scary and well acted. Unlike most horrors that are produced in Hollywood nowadays this film turns its back on \"teen horror\", and the opening sequence can perhaps be seen as a kind of tongue in cheek rejection of teen based horror movies. The storyline in this movie manages to captivate you into the film; you find yourself caring for the main characters as well as feeling a fascinating mixture of pity and horror for the family featured in the video tape.Overall therefore the film comes across as a decent horror movie, with the director Gore Verbinski wisely using suspense over blood to scare the audience. Verbinski is triumphant in so far as he has created a film whose dark mood manages to leave an unsettling psychological effect on the audience by the end of the film. The main actors too are in good form, in the shape of Australiasians Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson. Another major plus for this film is the cinematic use of colouring. There is a distinct use of dark greenish imagery throughout this film which greatly heightens the gloomy atmosphere that Verbinski clearly wants to create.That said this film is not without criticism. The ending is unsatisfactory and damages much of the good work of the film up until that point. There is also little attempt made at making sense of just who the little girl really was, and why she was doing what she was. The boy too is a bit tedious, his character almost seems to be saying to the audience \"we wanted Haley Joe Osmond but he is now too old and too expensive.\" That aside this is a decent horror movie, though had i seen the original, like with so many other Hollywood remakes i suspect i would have been disappointed with this film.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'm tempted to be as harsh as possible, on principle. This film cost $US45 million to make. The cost of striking, say, 3,000 subtitled prints of the original Japanese \"Ringu\", which had already been made and paid for, would have been, effectively, nothing, since distribution costs aren't included in that $45 million figure anyway. It would have made as much sense to have paid $45 million in salaries to the hundreds of people who served on the cast and crew making them shuffle around in aimless circles for three months.I'm not saying this because \"The Ring\" happens to be a remake. There's nothing wrong with that. I don't think Francis Ford Coppola should have been deterred from making his 1992 \"Dracula\" by the existence of John Badham's 1979 \"Dracula\". Clearly, Coppola felt that he had his own approach to the material, and he was right. It was, admittedly, a stupid approach, and he bungled it even so, but you can't blame a man for trying. The 1979 \"Dracula\" was itself an nth-generation remake, and IT was an effectively different movie from ITS predecessors ... and in at least some cases, a better one.But a mere four years separate the Nakata's \"Ringu\" from Verbinski's \"The Ring\" (less, if you count from when the original was released to when the remake commenced pre-production), which is hardly likely to be enough time to come up with a distinct viewpoint - and Verbinski seems to have one out of his way to avoid doing this. Even the locations seem to have been chosen so as to duplicate the original Japanese locations as precisely as possible; they've also been shot in almost exactly the same manner. When we get our first glimpse of Anna Morgan it came as a shock to me that she white, not Asian. What was I expecting? I don know, but I probably forgot, for the moment, which movie I was watching. (By the way, the fact that the villainess isn't Japanese is actually a problem. The thick veil of black hair that covers her face - this, too, Verbinski has slavishly copied - looks far more like the work of make-up artists trying too hard.)Since it's been slavishly and competently copied from a brilliant original, there's no denying that \"The Ring\" is a good movie. Everything that worked in the original also works (to some degree) here; it probably also worked in the Korean remake, and if the film's ever made in Germany, it will probably work there, too. But a director who binds his fingers in this fashion and forces them to trace the outlines of someone else's work is highly unlikely to be able to command as much power. The most extreme example of this effect is Gus Van Sant's remake of \"Psycho\", scene-for-scene identical to a masterpiece yet bordering on being downright bad. And when Van Sant DID have the nerve to change something and strike his own path, the result was, to put it kindly, unmotivated; to put it more accurately, breathtakingly moronic. The same happens to a lesser degree here. Nakata's \"Ringu\" had an admirable simplicity. Verbinski, aware that he's contributing nothing of substance, can't help gilding the lily here and there, which does only mild harm, but cetainly no good. For example, there's too much STUFF on that cursed videotape. The heroine in this version has at least a dozen different premonitions of her impending demise - nosebleeds, horses, water, dreams, scars, coughed-up wires, ladders, blurred photographs - where two or three would have been more than enough. And the added digital effects serve no purpose other than to let us know that there are digital effects.In this fashion Verbinski ruins Nakata's scariest scene.Spoilers follow... The scariest scene in the original was the one in which the villainess crawled out of the well in the videotape... and then proceeded to crawl out of the television, and across the room, as well. This took place in a small, closed, sparsely furnished apartment, in the dark, and we saw it in a single, unblinking, front-on camera shot. Verbinski sets the sene in a a more open place with plenty of windows and he keeps CUTTING: showing Samara crawling out of the television from the front, then from the side (in the kind of effects shot designed to make the trickery of the special effects people look more imressive, at the expense of everything else), then from a long shot, all the while jumping back and forth between this and action taking place elsewhere.I could forgive Verbinski these missteps on the grounds that he has, after all, made a decent, involving, atmospheric, and mildly terrifying film. But it really is the original all over again. The only difference is that it's not as good.'\n",

Her son Aidan (David Dorfman) has been drawing strange pictures that end up being part of the mystery.

More investigating leads them back to the cabin and they discover a well under the floor where they think Anna's dead daughter may lie.This film was directed by Gore Verbinski who is a very talented director and he would end up making \"Pirates of the Caribbean\". This is a very good looking film that keeps a dark and hazy atmosphere throughout and I don't recall one scene that has sunshine in it. Every shot that takes place outdoors is either rainy or overcast and it helps create an eerie mood to the film. I enjoyed the pacing of the film and it keeps your interest throughout although there are a few changes in the script from the Japanese version to make it more Americanized. The one problem I had with this film was that it didn't seem to want to end and there were probably three different times that it could have. It just seemed to go on and on and I have to admit that I can't really explain everything I watched in this film. It is a complicated story and to it's credit this film never ventures into typical Hollywood cliche's but I wish this could have been wrapped up better. I do recommend this film and Watts once again proves she's a solid actress but the script sure could have been tightened up. The original is definitely better but this isn't a bad effort.'\n",

            "Review: 'Most horror movies seem to use either unique or unoriginal ideas and use strong horror violence to scare you. The Ring is a well-made remake of a creative Japanese horror film that's genuinely frightening. To all horror creators and producers out there, movies like The Ring is what true horror fans are looking for: smart, scary and disturbing ideas that do not rely on heavy blood and gore. The best thing about this film is there's barely any violence and it's still super creepy, unsettling and frightening.Why do the majority of horror movies rely on bloody violence for scares? A scary film can be gory, but it's annoying when that's the only \"scary\" element. What makes films like this one scary is the unexpected flashes of horrific imagery, dreadful sound effects and usually the style. The Ring is basically a reptile; it's cold blooded as in the visual colours are blue, dull and cold and it's extra psychological that way.The film's producers and the crew who made some of these great ideas need at least 50% of the credit. It can be a slow-burn, but is usually able to entertain audiences with its psychological mystery. Plenty of horror movies are still decent with \"happy endings\", but some need twisted closings and other questioning elements to leave everyone like they've witnessed a real horror flick. No need for gory slashings and average characters; creators need to start using chilling visuals, unique stories and unsettling soundtrack.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.'\n",

But not the \"scary\" that most American audiences expect, with decomposed-faced ghosts popping up, grabbing your ankle, weird noises in the wall. Nope, this ghost hardly makes any appearances at all. There are one or two jump scenes, but nothing that will really freak you out. What makes this movie so scary is the sense of impending doom, like a black raincloud hanging over your head, ready to burst any minute. It's the kind of fright that hasn't been successfully made since The Sixth Sense or even Psycho. Hardly anything is shown, but everything else is shoved in your face to make you think that you saw everything that you didn't really see. And that's what gives you nightmares.What's also creepy is that it's not your everyday plot: psycho killer on the loose, or even boy who can see ghosts. No, this plot has been weaved and woven to the point where only those with enough patience are able to sit down and unknot the plot until they can go \"oh! now I get it....\" but just like fractions, that's not the end. There's back story and after story and clever twists and turns and meatballs every now and then.So if you're interested in a good psychological ghost thriller, grab a trustworthy pet to cuddle and a glass of water and, contrary to what many critics say, watch it alone! It's juicier that way and will have you leaping backward away from your television set faster than you can say \"seven days.\"My take: 8/10'\n",

            "Review: 'God, now they're looking to remake films within four years of release! Well, if nothing else, THE RING has generated polarised opinion. Is it or isn't it better than Japan's RINGU (1998)?  My opinion is that its pretty line-ball. For 4/5 of the movie the American version has arguably the edge, but production values and a dodgy last 10 minutes detract.Many images from THE RING are just superb. As creepy and as disturbing as anything I've seen since THE INNOCENTS. Clever SCREAM type opening which broadens into an intelligent and articulate tale of distinct horror. Aussie Watts turns in a blinder of a performance that leaves Kidman's turn in THE OTHERS a work of almost mediocrity. The film follows the Japanese version very closely, diverging principally with the central players and the plot-line variance. There is nothing to be gained re-hashing the story, any interested party will be aware of it.Certain aspects to the film are quite memorable. The cinematography for one. This is is a class of its own. The scenes with the horse aboard the ferry are as striking as they are horrific. The unfolding of the mystery is where THE RING becomes unhinged. Having been far to manipulative and clever for its own good, the makers were only ever left with a narrow window of credibility and backed into a corner the thing doesn't gel, with far too many unanswered questions and riddles. The greatest horror was in what you DIDN'T see...thus when poor old Noah finds himself watching the absolute last film he ever needed to see, the audience is suddenly handed a total rip-off of Dario Argento's DEMONS which wrecks both continuity and credibility. As many have pointed out also, the incessant appearance of the boom-mike is just inexcusable in a film of this quality and totally wrecks the tension and mood.Many were the good things to be had but 7.9 is an insane rating with regard to many other classics of film I could name that have rated far less in the IMDb. 6.8 perhaps!   I would be lying if I said that I did not enjoy this film..it COULD have been one of the best horror/psychological films of the past 30 years.

This thing has virtually no acting whatsoever.  I was not impressed.  This movie couldn't scare a mouse even if it wanted to.  It's also emotionless.  It's basically and truely an americanized version of Ringu.  And it goes with all the blame.  Blame the parents, blame the parents.  The original movie put the blame on mistreatment from the mother perhaps, but mostly the doctor who killed her.  But in The Ring, the father is at fault, the mother kills the girl.  And the movie doesn't end all that good.The pace of the movie is poor.  Takes 55 minutes to go thru 6 days and 60 minutes to go thru 1 day.  Alot of the movie doesn't make sense.  The video is totally stupid. (the one we ain't supposed to watch)The timelines are rediculous.  That cabin is far older than 40-50 years.  It looks like it was built in the late 1800's.  And even at that, I grew up going to this cabin that was built in 1910 and it looked far nicer.  (yes it was a cabin.  paper thin walls built on bricks type thing) \n",

Which for a good chunk of the movie the mother could care less for.My recommendation.  Watch Ringu first.  Then watch this movie at your own risk.  Ringu is very deceptive.  Certainly it won't make you jump watching it, but don't walk round in the dark for awhile.The Ring will make you want these people to die.  Especially that stupid brainless mother.

            "Review: '\"The Ring\" is the Hollywood adaptation of the 1998 Japanese film \"Ringu\", which was itself based on the novel of the same name by KÃ´ji Suzuki. I haven't read the novel, nor have I seen the original film, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of this adaptation. My only point of comparison for this review is other genre films.In that regard, \"The Ring\" is a cut above the usual horror fare. Relying more on atmosphere than cheap shocks, the movie engenders in the viewer a keen sense of unease. The central mystery of the story is absorbing and creepily presented.The story revolves around a videotape that somehow causes the death of anyone who watches it. When a young female journalist (Naomi Watts) sets out to uncover the mystery of her niece's death she ends up being exposed to the tape's malign influence. With just a week before her appointed death, she frantically attempts to unravel the mystery in an attempt to escape her fate.While the story is interesting, the cast isn't especially impressive; that is, apart from the beautiful and talented Naomi Watts. The male lead, Martin Henderson, isn't too bad but he seems to have been cast more for looks than acting prowess. Young David Dorfman contributes a pretty good 'creepy kid' performance but his character is a little underdeveloped. The always reliable Brian Cox is a welcome addition in support but most of the remaining players are satisfactory but nothing more.Gore Verbinski's direction is nicely handled with a good understanding of building tension and sustaining mood. The visuals are often creepy and the cinematography is appropriately gloomy. The score by Hans Zimmer is also a key part of the film's foreboding atmosphere.However, while the movie does several things right, it isn't perfect. There are at least a few scenes that are like something out of a more conventional, teen-oriented horror movie. The central mystery of the story also may be a bit too obscure for some viewers. The ending also seems a bit forced to me, coming from a time when last minute twists were particularly fashionable. I also feel that the final act extends the movie a bit beyond its ideal running time.Ultimately, though, \"The Ring\" is definitely one of the best horror movies of the last decade or so. The PG-13 rating shows that the movie's impact comes from carefully managed suspense rather than gratuitous gore. So, this movie should appeal to more than just horror fans.'\n",

The plot, from what I can figure out, is that a woman tries to solve the mystery of a video tape that causes anyone who views it to die within seven days. That is an interesting plot but it was hard throughout the movie to understand what was going on. It also stretched out and got very boring at some parts. I might re-watch it because I'm not sure I got all the details. It's not a bad movie, 2002 was a great year for horror movies, but my friend and I watched it together and neither of us could really understand much in it.You've gotta give them credit for that scene with the poor horse going under the boat though, that was scary as heck and really disturbing.'\n",

            "Review: 'When the niece of investigative reporter Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts,beautiful and intriguing as always)dies under strange circumstances related to a video cassette and her quiet,shy grad school-age son(David Dorfman)seems to know more about the situation than he should,she decides to investigate what at first seems to be an urban myth.What she uncovers is something of a dark and disturbing riddle that traces to a small island community off the coast of Washington state involving a horse stable owner(Bryan Cox),his wife and his other-worldly daughter,now both deceased. With her ex-husband (Martin Freeman)in tow,Rachel tries to stop whatever it is that's been cursing the video tape before it goes for it's next victims:namely,her ex,her son and herself. This is supposed to be a shot-for-shot American remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu,but since I've yet to see the original,I can only truly judge this film for its own merits. Director Gore Verbiski(spelling?),who would follow this late fall of 2002 hit with another pay-dirt movie in Pirates of the Caribbean,Curse of the Black Pearl,is very good about keeping the scenery and images as gray,rainy and gloomy as possible throughout much of the film(Setting it in Seattle and near Vancouver was a very deft move). This film never strays too far from the concept of imminent peril hanging over anyone unwise enough to mess with the tape. I'd suppose that my problems with this movie mostly stem from the ending,which I will not spoil to you here,only to say that it seems to not tie together the questions of the movie as it would like. In other words,it,to me,seemed to only open up more plot gaps and questions as it sewed up. I will say that might have had to do with the producers wanting to leave room for a sequel,but somehow it feels like that could've been done more cleverly than it was.Still,a good watch for someone who appreciates the more visceral side of scary,tense,compelling movies.'\n",

This one is not a complete copy, and there were surprisingly a lot of changes.In the original, the ex-husband character was a smarter and more intriguing character because he had a special ability. In this one, however, he became more like a dumb cop type of character that didn't believe his ex-wife at first and also teased her. So that change wasn't an upgrade.The young son character was given more time to shine in the remake. He was quite a creepy one.The main story behind the tape was changed quite drastically. In the original, the ability of the husband character helped solving the mystery. For this one, since the ability is not there, the characters had to explore the story more, and that improved the storytelling because there's much less exposition.Also, the infamous tape had better content in the remake. With improved technology, the visuals in the remake tape, albeit slightly similar to the original, were more disturbing and creepy. Even more, the details in the remake tape provided more important clues that the main characters had to use to understand the complete story. Because of this, I felt more intrigued into the story and more on edge whenever I recognized the clues in the tape.Another interesting change was the color and atmosphere of the movie. In the original, the quality was purposefully low to provide a raw and uncomfortable atmosphere. In the remake, however, the quality was good, but the color was mostly depressing blue. This made me felt like sad and melancholic. I prefer the original for this because it made me feel more uncomfortable.Lastly, the ending was changed a bit. I definitely preferred the original ending, which was more disturbing and consequential.Overall, it is a slight upgrade over the original. The story and the creepiness was better, but not every change improved from the original. 7.5/10.'\n",

            "Review: 'Taken at mere face value, The Ring, has much going for it, in spite of some small minuses. It's no secret, of course, that it is a remake of a Japanese film based upon a Japanese novel, which is in turn based upon an obscure text about people dying after reading a book. So while it isn't quite as original as it appears, it deserves major kudos for not going down the same road as almost every other Hollywood cookie cutter horror film of the past fifteen years.I'll deal with the negatives before I go into the positives. They won't take long. First of all, there's people who compare this film to The Sixth Sense simply because it has a somewhat spooky child as one of the main characters. The Sixth Sense was a copy, and not a very good one at that, of the Richard Matheson novel A Stir Of Echoes, out of which a far superior film of almost the same name was made. The reason Stir Of Echoes was far superior to The Sixth Sense, ability to acknowledge its source material aside, was that the child character was actually likeable. In The Ring, the child character is tedious and unsympathetic, a major problem that occurs in nearly every Hollywood film where children take part.Second, as has been mentioned before, the equine deaths mentioned in this version are unnecessary and pointless. They add nothing to the character we're supposed to be afraid of. The screen time used to detail this element could have been put to better use in linking the episodic days together with more strength.The strengths of this film can also be mistaken for weaknesses. For one thing, it is good that we know next to nothing about the little girl whose voice we hear after the video is watched. All we need to know about her is that she has had a harsh, tragic life, one that she is none too happy about. The tagline that you see a ring before you die is pretty literal, but it's learning why one sees a ring that makes this part of the film interesting. In essence, the film knows what to tell the viewer and when, which is essential in making any horror film work. This is one of the few Hollywood films that gives our imagination something to do.Another high point of the film is the special effects, or the restrained usage thereof. So many horror films rely on numerous effects to paint this or that character to be the most horrific thing you'll ever see on celluloid. The problem is that the viewer winds up drowned in so many effects that they become numb to what they're supposed to be horrified by. In The Ring, videotape viewings aside, the special effects are sparse and, at least by appearance, mostly practical. The points when it stops looking \"real\" are those when it suits the story not to do so. Which only helps the situation. I'd rather have five minutes of \"bad\" special effects in a two hour film than two hours of being drowned in \"good\" ones that only seem to remind me that they are effects.If original ideas, or at least ones that don't resemble every other that is coming out at the time, were more frequent in Hollywood, it would be safe to say that The Ring would not be getting as much praise as it is. However, since there's no jingoism, propaganda, or feel-good crap to be found here, The Ring is indeed a rare product from Hollywood. The absence of any obvious pandering to focus groups alone makes The Ring worthwhile. In all, I give it an eight out of ten.'\n",

            "Review: 'The Ring started what became a wave of horror remakes from Japanese cinema, and while other tales such as The Grudge were not as critically well received, The Ring truly earned its merit among audiences. The movie starts out with Seatle reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) aiding her sister after the mysterious death of her niece-- a death that was provoked by watching a mysterious videotape and not following the rules in order to save one's life. After seeing the tape herself, Rachel is horrified to learn that those who see it have seven days until they die, unless they somehow manage to avoid death, by performing the task that the spirit haunting the tape wishes the viewer to do; if you're not familiar with the full plot by now, keep yourself unspoiled and discover it for yourself! As the film progresses Rachel seeks the help an exboyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) in order to discover the origins of the mysterious tape before it is too late. What Rachel discovers is a dark, hidden story from one of the Pacific Northwest's many small island communities, where a small girl arrived with her adoptive parents, only to cause grief that they could have never imagined. Has she young girl returned to seek her revenge? The visual style of The Ring is arguably its greatest asset. Imagery is both creepy and alluring, with the film's dark color palette adding to the cold, wet climate of The Pacific Northwest. While certain aspects of the film are a bit far fetched or not fully developed, The Ring stands out as one of the better psychological horror films in recent memory, aided by a unique story, strong performances and haunting visuals. Highly recommended for all, and enjoy looking for a hidden DVD extra!'\n",

Sadly, it proves what I've always believed: no matter how good the original story is, the final product will still be less than great in the hands of mediocre talent (see also Brett Ratner and Ted Tally's Red Dragon, they totally missed the heart of the story. Hint: The heart wasn't Lecter's conversations with an FBI investigator in the asylum-like it was in Silence of the Lambs, and it wasn't ALL Dolarhyde, OR the investigation...)The movie is overpraised by people (I think such praises reaches its nadir in the review that's currently on the main page for this movie. The guy sounds like a publicist, with delusions about the power of film. Sorry to break it you, but you don't hover above the masses, and the masses aren't stupid enough to throw away their VCR'S after watching, what is afterall-A MOVIE, and not a very scary one at that), but it does have its merits (however I give Gore Verbinski very little credit, even if he feels he's made the story he's own. Sorry, director boy, you OWE EVERYTHING to the original story. Try NOT making a movie that's a \"sure sell\" like the horrible movie \"The Mexican\", and that isn't reverently faithful to something which is pretty good to begin with-i.e\"Ringu\"). The movie has an great first third (seeing how the first victim's body ended up was pretty freaky), very low key and creepy, and you think its setting you up for a good slam bang finale.  It isn't.  Maybe I shouldn't have expected too much from a PG 13 movie.  Simply put, the movie lacks tension; Rachel's investigation lacks urgency, and the dates that are VERY frequently flashed across the screen give the movie an episodic feel that doesn't help matters at all. It goes NOWHERE, and the open ending is HIGHLY anti-climatic. Imagine getting on board a rollercoaster that sputters to a stop midway and you'll get an idea of what watching this movie is like.I love the concept though-a video tape that kills is something only the Japanese could concieve of (their love affair with technology and their personalization of it is apparent yet again.

The photos of the lighthouse, the horses, Ann Morgan, the snippets of text in the articles were haunting.  The music adds to this.   This reminds me a bit of \"Blowup\" where a photo is searched to find a killer. Another eerie investigation takes place in \"Angel Heart\".   Also in The Shining, Nicholson discovers the history of the hotel by looking at old articles in the basement. The viewer becomes as obsessed with the history as the characters in the films do. In The Ring, one is left wanting to see more of the history to explain what has happened.  I could have had another hour or so on this investigation side of the film.

Secondly, part of the reason that I have not seen that film is because just the trailer for Ringu terrified me while watching the DVD of The Ring.It took me a long time to see The Ring.  I am notoriously a lightweight when it comes to horror films, a trait that still baffles me as I was a horror film junkie when I was in my teen years.  Having heard the premise of the film, I was intrigued - I thought it was an interesting idea, an urban legend in the making.  However, finding someone to watch this film with me proved an impossible task - they had either seen it and were freaked out enough by it to wait awhile, or they were so offended by it's very audacity to try to compare itself with the original.  But, see it I finally did, and I'm glad that I did.From the start, Gore Verbinski directs the film with immense style.  The cinematography is the visual embodiment of despondency, and it works.  The atmosphere is incredibly dreary (you never see the sun shining, and rain is the forecast for much of the film) but it *should* be as such.  These elements, added to some incredibly disturbing imagery made me feel like I was in a dentist's chair waiting to have a tooth pulled:  The tension was palpable.**Spoiler Within**This is not a `fun' horror film to watch, however.  Perhaps if I had watched it in the theater it would have been different, but I remember seeing House of 1000 Corpses and having a great time because the audience was getting into it.  This was a horror film that kept me at rapt attention, and I didn't laugh once, even nervously.  It did, however hold surprises for me: There were not a lot of `BOO!' type scary scenes, I can actually only think of two where I jumped, rather the imagery itself was extremely disturbing. The actual `video' is comprised of several frightening images with jump cuts that at first made me harkens back to my student film days, but became more disturbing as I thought about said images.  Additionally, the movie was a surprise to me in that it wasn't just a horror film; it actually could be deemed a mystery/suspense film as well - with life and death depending on its resolution.  It also contains one of the scariest sequences I have ever seen, when Samara is crawling out of the well and out of the television. This was the second time I saw the film, and I was just as scared during this part, if not more. There are few people I have encountered who saw the film who did not acknowledge that this scared them, just a little.The Ring is far from a perfect film.  The acting is wooden, the characters have no substance and I'm getting a little tired of the cliché creepy kid with a `sixth sense'.  It also had a pretty weak ending.  However having said that, I feel that some of the most common complaints regarding The Ring are a bit unfair, and most of those complaints are those that say that Ringu is the better movie.  My thoughts on this?  Then watch Ringu.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with remaking a film that has been recently produced.  It is obviously a good story that Hollywood deemed worthy to put their own spin on, like it or not.  I can't make my own comparisons until I have seen Ringu myself, and I won't deny that I relish in the fact that foreign films are more liberal with `unhappy endings' than Hollywood films, but I feel that The Ring was a decent film on its own merits.  If anything, Ringu loyalists should be delighted that The Ring gave Ringu so much press that it is now available to buy or rent just about anywhere.  I heard rumor that a sequel to The Ring is in the works, and if it does half as well as Ringu 2 and Ringu 3 did in Japan I think we are looking at a franchise here. Hopefully it won't follow in the tradition of most franchises and sacrifice quality for quantity.'\n",

Sure, there is suspense and it gets a tiny bit spooky, but most of it is only from all the morons you know telling you \"oh my god, THE RING made me p*ss my shorts!\". This ain't scary. Now, on to something else...The story is good, but it so closely similar to FEARDOTCOM, you wonder if the same writer didn't use a different name and write FEARDOTCOM as well. Speaking of writer, the film is written by Ehren Kruger, the guy behind the writing of SCREAM 3 (a film which I probably gave far too low of a rating, it was quite good)...yeah, he returns to write THE RING. He is getting better with time and he is beginning to grow on me. He *almost* scared me with this one. The film is at times tinted a gloomy greyish color which also mimics FEARDOTCOM and David Fincher's masterpiece SE7EN. And, speaking of story...the film is based on some movie called RINGU, apparantly one of Japan's biggest hits in like, forever. Uh, well they must have some pretty bad movies over there, because out here in USA-ville, we had a couple tons of better movies than THE RING. I can't judge as to how good that film is, but I will soon see it.As for THE RING, the cast is not very big, there are not very many characters. Brian Cox's (25TH HOUR) character doesn't come into the film until practically the very end and Naomi Watts I have never heard of before in my life. Also, I don't know about anyone else, but I was a little confused with this film. The whole thing moved fast and moved along quickly, but there were certain things that I just didn't understand. There are certain portions of the film that really don't make a whole lot of sense, and I was getting a little agitated towards the end and I even began thinking \"okay, what just happened?\". This film was a lot more thriller-ish than FEARDOTCOM was, only because FEARDOTCOM went more for a horror approach on the audience, and horror films usually don't scare people too much. Thrillers are mainly the types of films that make people wet the bed. THE RING is a thriller. The whole thing with the 'ring' is also another one of those things that after you're done watching the movie, you kinda think \"ohhh!!\".Overall, not the best film ever made, but then again, I have seen a slew of films that sucked terribly. This is one of the bigger and better hits of 2002, and I recommend that you see this movie, because overall, it may not be very perfectly constructed, but at least it is entertaining.THE RING: 4/5.'\n",

            "Review: 'I've always felt that the most effective horror films are not the ones that have tons of blood and gore, or ones that just give you scare after scare, and the effect wears off when the lights come up.  The truly effective ones are the films that leave you shuddering for days after.  THE RING is a case in point.Naomi Watts stars as a Seattle newspaper writer who delves into the mysterious deaths of four friends of hers who apparently died after watching a strange videotape on a TV at an isolated mountain cabin.  When she watches it for herself, she sees the tape's grainy, nightmarish black-and-white images, beginning and ending with a mysterious ring.  It is immediately followed by a phone call, where the mysterious caller intones \"Seven Days\"--implying that she too will die, like her friends, within a week of having seen that videotape for herself.  She and her boyfriend (Martin Henderson) begin a search for how the tape was made, who made it, and why it was made.  The result is an unsettling mix of psychological and supernatural horror, with implications of Satanic imagery scattered throughout.Though it is a reworking of a 1998 Japanese film, THE RING manages to succeed on its own.  At first, it seems to start out as yet another teen-horror slasher film; but as time goes along, both director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger fashion a heart-pounding, chilling, and disturbing thriller.  There are a number of great shock effects, but none that are particularly gory.  THE RING is largely fashioned as a horror mystery.  In that case, it is much like THE SIXTH SENSE, even down to the details of Watts' son (David Dorfman) who knows more than what he's telling.Watts gives a very effective performance as the reporter; and the suspense is well-handled by Verbinski.  The score by Hans Zimmer is equally chilling, and at many points uses a variation the celebrated \"Dies Irae\" (Day of Wrath) theme, one that had been effectively used before in such films as THE SHINING and POLTERGEIST.  THE RING is not a scream-laden fest, but one that gets under the skin and into the mind.  On that count, it is extraordinarily effective.'\n",

It's straightforward and will leave audiences squeamish.Leave it up to Gore Verbinski to keep true to the original RINGU film in the atmosphere, plot, and all. Yet, I found the dedication a bit closer to copying rather than an emphasis on innovation. Reworking something more suitable for a western audience or simply plagiarism?Also, I found the green, static filter over the entire film somewhat annoying. I can forgive low budget horror, but at least make it look good.3.5/5. Original (in Western horror films) and focus on suspense leaves this film above average in my book.'\n",

            "Review: 'This is a good scary movie if you like stuff like \"The Twilight Zone\" or \"The Mothman Prophecies\". Everyone knows the plot, as this movie has become quite famous, but i'll tell it anyway: A reporter investigates the circumstances surrounding a videotape that causes your death in seven days if you watch it.This is a very entertaining and well-made movie, but there are a few problems.1. The dialogue in the first scene has to be some of the WORST dialogue I have ever heard in a movie in my life. It is lousy, unrealistic, and just plain atrocious. Luckily along came \"Scary Movie 3\" to make fun of it.2. There are some parts during the movie where the dialogue is also a little weak, although not as week as the absolutely dreadful first scene.3. There are some parts where Naomi Watts' character acts so dumb that its unrealistic. I mean, the character acts really stupid for no reason. I am keeping this review absolutely spoiler-free so I won't reveal any of those moments.That's about it. Other than those problems, the movie is quite fascinating. The acting is top-notch, its interesting, there are very entertaining elements, and its just plain fun to watch. Its also one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get sick of (well, for a while at least). In fact, the movie is so entertaining and good that it automatically makes up for all the flaws.ALso, the directing by Gore Verbinski is outstanding. Best part of the film.I said it once and i'll say it again, if you like Twilight Zone or Mothman Prophecies or anything like that, then this is the movie for you. If not, then this is still the movie for you.Its a scary, fun, interesting, and outstanding ride.I give it a 10 out of 10.'\n",

            "Review: 'I first watched this movie when it came out, then I was still in school, and it was a scary horror to me. Now I see that this is more of a mystery / thriller with elements of the supernatural and horror. The effort is invested in a quality story, but also in the characters, I mean primarily the main actress and the little boy who plays the son. The main character is a journalist who is practically forced to solve a mystery that has been imposed on her in life. We follow as spectators and try to figure out what exactly happened. The atmosphere plays a big role in the film because the weather is always gloomy, it rains and the colors are almost non-existent. A few things in the film were not explained to the end, I was not happy about that. I'm sorry I watched the movie before so it didn't surprise me. I also didn't like the ending and that's why it gets a worse grade.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'm not really sure why The Ring was the huge success it was. It's not exactly a horror original as many feel it to be. Besides being based on \"Ringu\", how about a similar urban legend such as \"Candyman\" from 10 years earlier? And the distorted faces on photos & video, we've seen that before. There's even a similarity to the doomed characters in \"The Omen\" way back in '76, whose deaths were foretold in photos. But all this may be irrelevant as The Ring uses the best elements of horror and makes them its own. Perhaps the most frightening element, at least on first viewing, is the suggestion this could really be; the viewer even notices a slight video static before the movie proper, on the FBI warning note on the DVD, for example. It's a clever tactic to send a shudder early on.The main power of the story is that it's a journey of discovery - some dark discoveries, to be sure, but compelling nonetheless. You're drawn to be a witness to the main character's journey. It's almost playful at first - rumors, gossip; she listens, a bit bemused. It's a slow, gradual rise in the dread. Naomi Watts has the task of tugging us all along with her and she's very good. You see that slight terror and disgust in her features when she first views the tape and you feel sympathy; you know things will continue to get worse. The countdown to doom, day by day, is also nothing new, but that doesn't mean it can't be effective. And it's strengthened by the increasing knowledge that this is a doom one cannot escape; no running away, no weapons will help. The photography also helps in creating a very oppressive atmosphere. Some of the scenes also remind of Kubrick's \"The Shining\" from 1980; it's a mood of steadily oppressive horror. All this works when you first see the film; on 2nd viewing you know who will or won't die and the viewing experience is rather empty. So watch it a second time. It'll get rid of the shudders.'\n",

            "Review: 'Aren't you glad that they have DVDs now? In Gore Verbinski's The Ring, viewers of a special videotape of seemingly unrelated shots get a phone call saying \"seven days\", meaning they have seven days to live. That's right. Mr. Budweiser Frogs and Mr. Mouse Hunt made this movie. Quite a transition.Naomi Watts, fresh from Mulholland Drive, plays skeptic newspaper reporter Rachel Keller. She hears about the videotape at a niece's funeral, and decides to investigate. And what does Ms. Smart do? She watches the tape and she gets the phone call. Oy, she'll regret that.The Ring, put in one word, is scary. It checks off the four ills: chills, thrills, spills, and yes, even a few kills. There are many, many tense scenes and scenes that make you jump (or scream, whichever type you are). I'm the jumping type, but in some parts my mouth was open. That's how scary it was. On the downside of the creepiness, Verbinski made too many jump scenes. If he had concentrated on putting on a few more sustained thrills, that would have helped.Watts wasn't super or anything, but she was serviceable. Martin Henderson, as Noah, a partner, was the same, nothing to write home about. Their son Aidan, played David Dorfman, made me think of him as a cross between Haley Joel Osment and a Disney cartoon. He had the look (and at the funeral, was exactly the same way) and he had huge eyes. And speaking of cartoons, I just noticed that Daveigh Chase, from Lilo and Stitch and Spirited Away plays Samara, a very important part of the movie.In a small but important role, Brian Cox plays Richard Morgan, Samara's father. He seemed to do like Donnie Wahlberg did for The Sixth Sense, playing a small part but obviously working hard to perform it. Cox seems to be the hardest working man in showbiz now.The runtime could have been trimmed by a little, but The Ring still kept engrossed me for two hours. It is the type of movie that will either keep you up at night or give you nightmares. Or both.The Ring doesn't really give you any characters to connect with. There aren't many, but some of the time used unnecessarily could have been used with characterization or time to feel for and with the characters.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for scares, violence, ickyness, and some language.'\n",

This one I thought might be a thriller but it turned out to be pure horror. My experience with this genre is limited, because I've always thought I've got plenty of nightmares and problems in my own life. I don't need to spend $10 to see a film that tries to emotionally scar me for life.However, since I did see it -- I must say it was thoughtful and well-done. Unlike films such as Halloween 3 or Poltergeist, where the story is basically \"Oh, they're magic so they can pretty much do anything,\" the mysteries of The Ring are partially explained and the story actually goes somewhere rather than consisting of a lot of running around.The acting, cinematography, were powerful and the film was quite scary. There is only a little gore in the film; it was definitely more cerebral and less hack-n-slash.Who should see this film:-- horror fans only, but it's worth your moneyI'll give this film a 7 out of 10, even though it really deserved an 8, just because it's not my thing personally, and for the ending which worked but created more loose ends than it tied up.'\n",

            "Review: 'I returned to The Ring franchise to prepare for the newest entry: The Ring 4. In 2023, I have a vision of whether the first three films in the franchise will stand the test of time, starting with 2005's The Ring.This film is the American adaptation of the Japanese adaptation Ringu, which in turn is the adaptation of the book Ring by Koji Suzuki. The premise is the same in all works: a curse falls on people who watch a cursed video cassette tape. Seven days is the remaining lifespan of the cursed.As much as these are the best known adaptations, there were others, but I didn't watch them to be able to do a comparison.I think the negative point of The Ring, as well as Ringu, is that the film fails to capture the essence of Suzuki's book, which is the investigation. Suzuki's work deals with dark and prejudiced themes that would certainly not make it into the adaptations, but the essence of the investigation that Suzuki discusses in his book is lost in The Ring. Same as in Ringu, in The Ring, the curse of the videocassette tape already exists in urban folklore, facilitating the beginning of the investigation into the origin of the tape.Another element that film adaptations have failed to translate is the tape's message. In The Ring, the tape is just morbid, whereas in the book the tape exists for an elaborate reason.Now, if we remove the comparison lens, is The Ring worth watching? The film uses good visual effects for the time. The atmosphere is dark for the entire length of the film, yet the film uses some cheap tricks. In 2023, The Ring is a horror classic that, like most classics, suffers from the fever of being a good movie that perhaps no longer caters to younger audiences.However, perfection is just a wish. The Ring struggles with forced exposure due to the inclusion of Aidan in the story, a child prodigy with psychic tendencies. Aidan moves the plot without apparent explanation, just because he feels things.The ending is as expected if you've read the book.The Ring does not reinvent horror by focusing more on the spooky factor than on the pseudoscience proposed by Suzuki, but the film is a horror classic. Recommended for nostalgia.'\n",

Though compare to the Japanese it might not be that creepy (but don't think it is not creepy, because it is). And overall it is much watch able than the original, more enjoyable since you don't have to read the subtitle; bigger budget and makeup make the movie even more enthusiasm to watch.Reason To Watch: · Naomi look really great, · Brilliant acing by D.Dorfman · Amber Tamblyn, after all it is so hard to see her. · Very satisfying and money worthy. · Good remake and the director did capture Japanese style very well.Reason Not To: · Might be disturbing by the video, · Why is this movie was made even though the Ringu is still a new movie.· Might be very scary for some people.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)'\n",

Also the fuzzy television was lovely, and killing people by scaring them, brings a new freshness into the movie world. I just have to say that no movie makes me want to be smothered and pushed down a well like this one!!! Samara Morgan will become one of the classic horrifying murderers with her counterparts: Michael Meyers, Jason, Freddy Krueger, and Leather Face.

Technically it is very good, clean straight horror, no hanging parts there. However there is an important difference. Sixth Sense speaks a powerful humanity, ghost or not, a palpable longing for living that is very sad and beautiful. The Ring has some good moments - the island, lighthouse, a mysterious pall reminiscent of Hitchcock's Vertigo. But it's mostly about a kind of pure, wantom evil, that after the paralyzed state I start to want badly to fight back, tooth and nail, come what may. As of the moment, millions of worms are squirming on my screen(in the DVD extra). My hair is still raising but the scare is giving way to rage, sort of. Strange to be so worked up. Rachel, handles herself admirably 7 days up to her scheduled doom, but the film detracts greatly with the end. It should be much better just with the scene in the extra, an unmarked tape beckoning ominously from the shelf.

Katie claims she watched the tape with three friends a week ago. Minutes later, Katie is killed by an unseen force, and Becca is institutionalized after witnessing it.At Katie's funeral, her mother, Ruth, urges her sister Rachel Keller, a journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel lives with her young son Aidan, who possesses a degree of mediumship. Rachel learns that Katie's friends Josh Turandot, Scott Conduroy, and Stacey Miller all died on the same night, sporting disfigured appearances. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn where Katie stayed, discovering the rumoured cursed videotape. Renting the same cabin as Katie, Rachel watches the tape, which contains disturbing, gruesome imagery. Once the tape ends, Rachel receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers \"seven days\".Rachel recruits Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidan's father, to study the tape, making a copy after he watches the original. Rachel begins to suffer supernatural symptoms as the week passes, haunted by a young girl with soaking wet hair. Investigation into the tape's imagery leads Rachel to Anna Morgan, a horse breeder from Moesko Island, who committed suicide after her prize-winning horses drowned themselves. Rachel catches Aidan watching the tape, and discovers Noah is suffering similar symptoms.Leaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel travels to Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard. On the ferry journey, a horse is spooked by Rachel's presence, leaping to its death. Noah goes to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Both separately discover Anna had an adopted daughter, Samara, who possessed an ability to psychically etch mental images onto surfaces and into minds, driving her parents mad. Rachel tries to speak with Richard about Samara, but he denies her existence.Rachel speaks with Dr. Grasnik, the island's general practitioner, who explains Samara was adopted due to Anna's infertility, recommending them to admit her to Eola, assuming Samara is still there. Rachel sneaks into the Morgan farmhouse, watching a videotape of Samara in a psychotherapy session, who claims she has no control over her abilities. Rachel confronts Richard, who electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a horse bridle upon learning Samara's powers are still at large. Noah arrives, he and Rachel go to the barn, where Samara was isolated in the loft. They find a burnt image of a tree, Rachel recognizing it from Shelter Mountain.They return to the cabin, locating a stone well hidden under the floorboards; the final image on the tape. Rachel falls in the well, experiencing a vision of Anna suffocating Samara and throwing her down the well, sealing her in, where she drowned seven days later. Samara's corpse surfaces after Noah tells Rachel that the seven-day deadline has passed.The next day, Rachel reassures Aidan that the curse has been lifted by liberating Samara. In a twist, a distressed Aidan tells Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara, revealing he is still cursed. In his apartment, Noah encounters the vengeful ghost of Samara emerging from his television, murdering him. Rachel, upon finding his disfigured corpse, returns home and destroys the original tape in a furious rage, asking why Noah was killed but she was not. She realizes that the difference is that she made a copy of the tape, which Aidan watched, thereby continuing the cycle that Samara wants to spread of duplicating the video and showing it to someone else to save oneself.Rachel shows Aidan how to make his own copy. He remarks that the curse will never stop and asks what will happen to the person who watches the new tape, to which Rachel does not answer.'\n",

Long have we waited for a movie to terrify us while leaving us scratching our heads.  Not since \"The Sixth Sense\" have I been so inspired by a horror movie.  The directing is pitch perfect.  Gore Verbinski did an outstanding job capturing shots that will stick in my mind for many years.  The acting was as well great.  You don't go into a horror film expecting good acting.  Sometimes, the acting is completely absent all together.  In this film, it was well above average. Bottom line:  not just a great horror movie, great movie.  Two thumbs way up!'\n",

In fact I was asking myself if it really should have been categorized as horror as most of the times director Gore Verbinski (the man from \"Pirates of the Carribean\") creates a sort of style in where some David Lynch-style is certainly there! The story itself is simple...there is a videotape around and once you saw it you will die within 7 days. Most of the directors would have made a sort of Friday The 13th with it but director Gore Verbinski let us investigate why such a videotape is made, where it comes from and it is here where the viewer will undersrtand some bits but not the whole thing, not that there is any need to understand the \"Eraserhead\"-like movie that will kill you once you've seen it. \"The ring\" is a Hollywoodversion from some Japanese cultmovie \"Ringu\" and Verbinski did a well job but only he should have chosen some better actors though, and not someone like Naomi Wats.'\n",

Case in point: I gave the original Ringu a 9; this movie I'm giving a 2. To be fair, if I had not watched the original movie before this one, I would probably give it a few more pointsSo where does this movie go wrong? I would say most of the fault lies with the director, Gore Verbinski, and his, well, chosen direction for the movie. He's taken one of the best horror movies out there, and art house-ified it. The result is a movie with luxurious cinematography but horribly inopportune splicing. In virtually every scene that's supposed to build to a scare, the movie ducks out before the payoff. And the montage that's on the cursed video simply looks like a collection of random shots, whereas the original montage looked appropriately like a portent of doom. The screenplay for this movie mirrors the original significantly. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the deviations the writer made. I don't recall too much of Ringu, having watched it years ago, but I'm pretty sure the horses weren't part of it and the boy wasn't psychic. I felt they were diversions that distracted from the main Samara plot. And oh yes, \"Samara\" doesn't sound half as creepy as \"Sadako,\" not to mention how much creepier Sadako looked too. The only thing I liked about the plot was that it managed to explain the aspects of the curse decently, including stuff I didn't catch in the first movie like the symbolism of the ring.It's terribly frustrating, trying to understand The Ring's appeal, particularly since most of the people who've seen it say it's scary. I reckon that if they ever watched Ringu, they'd have a heart attack.'\n",

Don't include low-budget B-movies here; they're all the same over the years. Now, films prior to the 70's were, in most cases, derived from old classics. Or, the stories were set in old times in old haunted castles. Films within 70's and 80's are mostly made up of gory violence, bloody horrifying spirits roaming around a quiet town or some deserted place at night and attacking young girls in candid conditions. Films after the 90's generally has a queer storyline and lots of visual and sound effects do the rest job, plus or minus violence. This is the general rule.... but of course, with lot of exceptions.\"The Ring\", a remake of the Japanese film \"Ringu\", falls in the last category and it, I must say, satisfied the conditions loosely. Well it has a queer storyline, good sound and visual effects, some instant chillers but the most important thing is, it has a fine seriousness over the story that is somehow scarce among the other modern horror films. The film never let the story get loose in any place. Though the plot is basically bogus, but the presentation of this plot is so fantastic and so realistic that when you are watching the film you are bound to take it seriously. That's where the success of this film lies.The content of the tape on which the story stands is brilliantly shot and presented... I must say. It is not really horrifying but artistic if you don't consider the fate of the viewers. Naomi Watts in her first leading role seemed very well. Dorfman as her son rather acted well but it seemed to me that his character is quite influenced by Haley Joel Osment in \"The 6th sense\" which was not a feature of \"Ringu\". However, locations of shooting were very well chosen.This film probably is one of the best in its genre and era. But the ending is too much overrated. There lies a little mess. Otherwise it is highly recommended. 4/5.'\n",

I was asking myself if it would be just another crappy horror movie, or maybe...something more. Well it's something more. Watching through the movie, I could not stop thinking of The X-Files or The Sixth Sense. The ending does make it rather special though.SPOILERSThe story starts with two friends, two girls. One of them had seen a VHS with a movie which is said to kill you one week after the day you had seen it. And, if you can possibly imagine, as the movie starts it's just that day! The start is quite tough and well made as it will most certainly thrill you if not scare you. The story from now on will follow the fate of three other people, who themselves have watched this wicked cassette. It will be a horror ride.The movie does have an interesting storyline and it does have the necessary scares to keep you glued to the chair(or to your partner). As it is a quality horror movie, which should sustain the \"damage\" it has caused, the end isn't all-telling. You would be the unlucky one if your phone rang just after \"the movie\". And if you didn't answer it, then you'd have to live with the scares for one week. Just what happened to a friend of mine. The acting goes well with what is happening and, as I've said(more or less), the couple really does remind me of the X-Files. And this is maybe a weak point of the movie. I mean, it's not that enchanting too look at something and say: Wait a minute! I think I've seen something like this before. It is a lack of originality.As a whole it's a very good piece of work. Not as thrilling as I might have wanted it and a little too unoriginal, but still very good. If you want to be in for some thrilling stuff, then just watch this piece of cinematography. 8/10'\n",

            "Review: 'Horror is my favorite genre, let me start off by saying that. With that being said, however, it is extremely hard to find good horror movies. They're often referred to as, 'horr-ible' movies, which a lot of the time, can be true of them, since a majority of the horror movies that come out are generally low-budget, bad casted, 'B' movies. But, this movie, was quite different. It captures attention right from the beginning, and doesn't let go of your fearful imagination, until the end credits role. There is non-stop intensity throughout the entire movie, and each puzzle piece, discretely and carefully makes its way into the film, without you realizing it until the end. Naomi Watts, wasn't exactly well-known before this movie came out, and it was somewhat of a surprise(at least to me), that after it came out, she became more prominent in the film industry. She was of course excellent in it, however it was the type of role, any mediocre actress could have played.The other big surprise that the film offered, was that it was originally a Japenease movie. Usually the remakes, either aren't as good, or don't do well, just simply because they were originally foreign. However, this movie definitely is much more different, and is on a completely different level then some of the others we're used to seeing, or hearing about.I loved it, and it's definitely one of the best, and one of my favorite, horror movies. It's not at all slow, just at the right pace, scary, yet more phsychological than bloody. And, although I loved 'Scream', and 'The Blair Witch Project', it's sort of a happy medium between the two. It's not as bloody as 'Scream', and yet not as mind-warping as 'Project'. It's again, in a league of its own, with scare tactics, and I give the film, and original creator of the whole idea, behind, 'The Ring' a standing ovation, for his efforts, in inventing the piece.Anyone who's a horror lover, will certainly take to this as well. But, I will warn the people who loved movies like, 'House of 1,000 Corpses'. This is not that kind of movie, and far from satanic, by any means. Of course, that always depends on each individual person's opinion on what satanic is. I feel, that it is not. And, I will let you know in other film reviews, what I consider to be satanic. Like, 'Corpses'...which I felt was satanic. But, again, this is not, and if you do like the other types, where all it would entail, is demonic possession, or bloody ouiji boards, and such...this is not that kind of movie.Check it out though, if you are a horror fan. It's a great watch, and it didn't do well, for nothing'.'\n",

So then you have Naomi Watts whose niece died from this tape and she is a reporter and decides to investigate. So it's a horror/mystery/thriller. She watches the tape and so the race is on against time to solve the mystery. She also shows it to the dead-beat dad of her kid (who also watches it on his own).There are a few criticisms I have. One is that there were too many B-movie thrills in it. Things like when the lady in the convienience store tells the dad \"You're going to die\" followed by \"from smoking too many cigarettes.\" Haha. Real clever there. Then there are dumb things like when Naomi comes home the babysitter is sleeping on a couch and it looks like she's dead. There are some stupid jokes thrown in also and it seems only for the \"well we need to correct the joke-to-thrill ratio here\"The other main criticism is the ending which was rather bleh. Apparently in the original RINGU movie it was the ending that made the movie but I think the ending ruined it here. Basically they spend most of the movie solving the mystery. Then after they solve it, they really didn't solve it! Wow. Then they use some lame claymation technique that looks like it came from \"Clash of the titans\" to scare you.

There's an air of dread hanging over it right from the beginning and any movie that has you feeling uncomfortable for almost two hours gets my vote.

I wasn't expecting to love it but it was impressively poorly written and silly.I'll start with what I liked then I'll talk about dumb things. Martin Henderson wasn't awful and Naomi watts was pretty good, not even close to her best performance but she was still decent. There are a couple jokes I thought were funny, though I can't think of any examples and I only watched it a day ago, not a good sign. Finally I thought the chocking on the ring scene was well presented I guess.Now for the stupid stuff. Spoiler warning from this point. Rachel decided to watch the tape even though she already knew that the people who watched a week ago died, she also already suspected the tape for being evil. The concept is the dumbest thing ever I couldn't take this movie seriously, you watch a tape you and die I week later, yep really. So much obvious foreshadowing which is definitely something I think is annoying. A lot of convinces, Noah breaks into the file storage room at the mental hospital and there are no guards or workers there and none turn up while he's looking for the file. it's the most conventional movie ever, me and my dad were predicting everything that happened before it happened. The horse scene on the boat is looked ridiculous and is ridiculously stupid, this was one of my least favourite scenes of the movie. Aiden is used so that the writers could do a bad job and still have the story make sense. Finally I'll end on one of my biggest problems with the movie as a whole, nobody who knows about that tape seems like they even care about dying in the next 7 days, everyone is way too rational in the face of death, nobody even raises their voice when they are just hours away from dying.Anyway the ring was not scary or interesting in my opinion.

Many watchers may have asked themselves WHO after all has made the mysterious video-tape with this \"freaky stuff\" in it (quotation). In \"The Ring\" I, Noah wonders in the presence of Rachel that their copy isn't a copy (because of the scrambled code-numbers), moreover, in the scene where the lady is combing her hair one does not see the shadow of the camera, which one would expect. Not even the filmed persons' shadows can be seen in the pictured mirrors, etc. The worst thing, however, is, that the fly that appears in the tape is mirror-inverted when Rachel sees her the first time. When she sees her the second time, she comes even out of the picture. It is clear, that the latter event is meant to prepare what will happen in \"The Ring II\" (2005), namely persons being able to transcend the con-texture-border between screen-inside and screen-outside reality. Actually, this phenomenon will be THE horror motive of the Ring II. But therefore, let us stick with the lacking shadows and the \"inverted\" fly. Another most interesting question is that obviously, Samara's father was not the film-maker, since there will be more films after his suicide, especially during the whole \"Ring II\".I therefore suggest as a solution that the authors of \"The Ring\" have used a seldom semiotic paradox, namely a sign without \"thetic\" introduction. Normally, every sign has to be \"thetically\" introduced, i.e. declared as a sign (the knot in your handkerchief, f.ex.). A sign is only a sign when there is somebody who declares it a sign. Sign do not exist in nature like eggs, boulders of water. Now, theoretically, one could think of a sign that consists only of a sign-carrier, an object, and, instead of the introducer of the sign, of at least one interpreter. Such a sign-model, at least in theory, fulfills the requirement of Peirce that a triadic sign relation is established. In other words: The mysterious video-tape in \"The Ring\" is a film that has never been made - but only watched. Consequently, what is shown on the tape cannot concern the past (like in normal movies), but must concern the future. And this is exactly what is happening in \"The Ring\": Rachel sees the lady, the mirror, the man standing on the upper level of the house, the burning tree, the worms ... and at the end the \"ring\" itself.If this interpretation of mine is correct - and I have no doubts that it is allowed to impute such a high form of metaphysics to whoever wrote the script - , then this movie deserves not only 10 points but needs to be welcomed in the exclusive club of those seldom products of entertainment industry which have truly brought forward scientific thinking.'\n",

Now, as time grows short, Rachel and Noah race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken horse ranch and a very strange little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase). The original \"Ringu\" was a work of art. it was scary...no, terrifying, original, creepy, and inspirational. When Hollywood wasn't doing so good, what was it time to do? remake it, except replace engaging characters with annoying ones, devoid any suspense and replace it with cheesy writing, and ruin what could have been a great remake completely. Thats not to say the big budget wasn't good for nothing, though.....the direction is stylish, the cinematography is okay, and there were 2 (yes, only two) scary parts: When they discover Katie's corpse in the closet and when the cursed tape is first shown. aside from that, it's quite boring. Just terrible. My rating for \"The ring\":1.5/10.About the DVD: Dreamworks has released an uninteresting DVD for the film. The 1:85.1 aspect ratio has lots of obvious edge enhancement and....surprisingly...some grain as well. The colors are ugly (The dark green cinematography certainly didn't help) and skin tones are bland. The audio, however, is excellent. The surround sound effects are quite good and make the film more jumpy than it really is. For extras we get exactly two crappy features--the first being billed as a \"Documentary\", when it is really only a slew of deleted scenes woven together seamlessly. The second feature is a trailer. The DVD's respectability is only a notch above the film itself. My rating for the DVD: 3.5/10.'\n",

            "Review: '\"The Ring\" was a tragedy and a triumph in my opinion.  Although I hardly feel that it was the scariest movie of all time (\"The Exorcist will always hold that record in my opinion) the story was spellbinding at the very least. Those who love a thrill ride, or simply a film that will keep them guessing and guessing to the very end will love it.  Much fresher and innovative than those of the likes of The Scream trilogy, this really is unpredictable.  Those who enjoy Hitchcock will enjoy the guessing, again and again about the ending.  High marks for this film.  Who doesn't need a decent scare once in a while?'\n",

            "Review: 'As you all sit there, scratching your head in wonder over who made the video and who was on the other end of that dreaded phone call, I sit here in all my slumber, merely a day after viewing this film and wonder how such a beautiful looking piece of cinematography could be so bad. This film tenders on the brink or ridiculous and seems content on explaining to us what is going on while never giving us anything to even remotely attempt to fathom what has just happened on the screen before us.  Mulholland Drive bombshell Naomi Watts stars as Rachel Keller. She is a single parent who lives in a high rise apartment and works as a journalist. When her niece faces sudden death (seen in the films prologue) Rachel fins herself out to investigate a mysterious video tape that, when watched will kill you in seven days. Rachel stumbles upon this video and after watching it runs around in a frantic panic to find out what is going on before her seven days are up. Yet after being viewed by her son and his father she is still running around in a stupor and we still have no clue what is going on. This film has some sort of hypnotic grip surrounding it that will either hold you until the very end or release you very early on, if you haven't guessed it released me. The film runs just a minute short of an hour, a time that makes it so tedious you will end up wondering when this thing will finally end more than what the heck is going on. The film was beautifully directed by Gore Verbinski who adds a certain aura of demented beauty into the repulsive images that plague the screen and rob the film of any real scares. The mixing of bright colours set upon the tone of a grey backdrop makes for a haunting images and probably the films only artful image (I am talking about a lone tree that stands atop a dying plain that slips from grey to bright red was the sun slowly glazes over it). The best part of the film by far is the video itself. Verbanski was reading heavily from the book of Lynch while he was dreaming up this video that sees pools of blood, swarms of maggots, a mirror that shifts positions, a musty old well and a women falling off the edge of a cliff. In fact Lynch's stylized weirdness pops up often in this film. In Lost Highway (Lynch's most abstract work), nothing makes sense in its pure irony. Weird things happen by never without reason or cause. Here weird things happen for the sake of having weird things happen. We see unexplained flashbacks; irrational explanations and pure amazement at how much more illogical on film can stretch itself to be. The film starts off creepy in theory, things happen that are not explained or are cause for explanation, wasn't that half the fun of The Sixth Sense? Then after seeing the video, Rachel goes on the hunt for the creator. She searches for a woman only to find she had committed suicide. She the gets caught up in a strange triangle involving horses going buck wild and then dying. She then meets and odd character who works at a horse ranch who refuses to discuss the video and finally begins her search for a little girl who may or may not be dead. The problem is that none of it interconnects for form and sort of opinion of explanation into the motivation behind neither the video nor the killings. *If you have not seen this this, this is the time to stop reading* This film left me with so many questions to situations that can't possibly have simple answers that I have to wonder why such a film would even want to evoke such questions. First who made the tape and what is its purpose? What relevance did the tape have to the dead horse rancher and the little girl? If the ring itself is the light the reflects through the opening around the stone barrier that sits on top of the well how can any light get in when the stone goes to the very edge on both sides of the well? What did mass horse genocide have to do with anything in this story? Finally if the little girl didn't want to be helped then why was Rachel led to help her? The ending of the film closes in an abrupt halt that again pays homage to Lynch but doesn't execute the technique right. Lynch can end his films like that because his stories have no beginning or ending. We open in the middle of someone's life and we close in the middle of someone's life. This film clearly established a beginning during the opening, possessed no real common ground that you could call a middle and exits without an ending. This film also never wanted to end; it had so many false endings that you almost need a spreadsheet to keep track of them. Instead of clearing up any unwanted confusion the film tries to prove itself to us by throwing in loads of new facts that only make the proceedings make even less sense. When you start your career at the very top of the heap where is there to go? That is a problem that Naomi Watts faces in this film. She is a great actress but with all the glory and pure emotion awe that was presented in Mulholland Drive it is usually not smart to follow up with a film that is of the same style but of a lesser grade. Although knowing not what this film was about I will still give you my honest thoughts on what I felt was presented. We are all reflections of what we see on television. The TV is a tool used to create false awareness and manipulate our minds into seeing ourselves in different light. I believe that Rachel was a reflection of the little girl. You will notice that almost every time we see the water we also see Rachel's reflection in it. Yet that is a contradicted thought because it is my belief that this is nothing more than an attempt to shock mainstream audience with a style only made popular in cult fashion. In all of my honest glory I must say that this film did nothing for me. It never once scared or intrigued me. I felt no emotion for these characters as they themselves had none, I really must stress that weirdness is not a good substitute for characterization and ever more so, logic. If it were up to me the cover of this film would not say `the scariest film since The Sixth Sense.' It would say `the biggest disappointment since Unbreakable.''\n",

Since she is a journalist the oddity of the kids' deaths (as well as the rumors) her looking into it would have been justified.  Maybe later on have a close relative of her's get killed.3.) Their should have been more victims that she ran across in her investigation to build up tension.4.) The relationship between her son and the girl was okay but it needed to be fully explained.  As it is it's weak.  The kid could be presented as the strange young lad that he is with an imaginary friend.  Then as the plot thickens we find out who the friend really is.

One great comment I have about this movie is how it leads you on that it's over. It makes you feel comfortable by giving you that warm feeling of seeing the kid's mother and father holding hands and then cuts to the scene with the kid's dad. The ONLY gripe I really have about the movie is how open-ended the ending is. It just leaves too much out and doesn't even really give you a solid clue of what happens after the end. It doesn't even really give you enough to think about to try and form your own hypothesis. I probably would've given the move a 9 if there was more closure at the end. Still a GREAT film and I highly recommend it to anyone.'\n",

            "Review: 'There are three main types of horror in the film world - gory horror, jump-out-of-your-seat horror and just plain weird horror. Though The Ring contains elements of all these three, the reason why it's so scary is because it's just so weird! I mean, even the tape alone had me freaked out - and when Rachel watches it in an empty cabin on an old TV on her own, it really builds up an atmosphere of true terror that no amount of disfigured corpses can do. Some scenes from this film are so strange and disturbing that they'll linger in your mind for the rest of your life. This was the film that inspired me to sleep with my bedroom door closed - creaking doors in the dark are the most haunting things horror has offered us. Samara is one of horror's most unorthodox villains - the bit where she comes out of the TV at the end is scary. And the ring left by the cup of tea on the newspaper - everything starts to come together. I personally found the conclusion hard to understand - I don't see how it brought everything together, and the sequel didn't exactly do a great deal of justice to any of it either. It is evident that some scenes were just put in the film for fright-factor rather than any real use in the plot, but this is one of the main problems of horror films. And as long as you've got a horror film with an original premise (a tape that kills you a week after watching it) and a few genuine frights (or, in The Ring's case, a lot), you've got an interested audience. There are some disfigured corpses and jump-out-of-your-seat frights, but The Ring is best in the sense that it is just spooky. And, in spite of what I said earlier, everything DOES kind of make sense - everything we see on the tape is later revisited. And when you see those places again, it feels very strange indeed... 9/10'\n",

The ideas presented in it can certainly give you a jump when your phone rings. Definitely watch it, at night, alone (or with a member of the opposite sex), and you will enjoy it. It might also be enjoyable for groups of young friends. As with most serious scary movies - you don't want people who lighten the mood. Stay in the right ambiance and you will be frightened.Not a recommended purchase (DVD/VHS) for most.'\n",

Before watching it, people told me how there were deeper meanings, it was about rings and circles and all sorts of gibberish. Nope, it's not that complex...-====Spoilers====-The movie is about a demonic child that is mysteriously adopted by a couple that raise horses. It is implied that perhaps they made a pact with the devil. The little girl makes everyone's life a living hell, especially her mothers, finally driving her mother to throw the little girl down a well and seal her in, leaving her to die. The little demonic girl exacts her revenge by leaving 'haunted' images on a video tape, anyone watching the tape will die 7 days later, presumably because that is how long the girl lived inside the well. Naturally there is a way to save yourself, but I won't tell how. The ending is way too long and you are left watching the clock wondering how much longer this movie is going to drag on.The movie overall isn't bad and I think it is the general lack of quality horror movies that makes people believe this one is so good. It is worth watching, just don't take it too seriously.'\n",

            "Review: 'One thing gave me hope. As I sat through Naomi Watts' first few scenes, I knew she was playing the character wrongly, too strong, too directed, too much the antithesis of fearful. I think she could handle the Sigourney Weaver role from \"Alien.\" But, thanks probably to the magnificent transformation Lynch gets out of her in the audition scene in \"Mulholland Drive,\" I kept waiting for her character to change, to learn fear and grow in it, especially to show the effects of the social responsibility \"Ringu's\" tape forces onto each it touches. She ever does. Maybe these things are in \"The Ring's\" too-faithful script. But they're never in her eyes.Hideo Nakata I consider a clever hack. \"Ringu\" is neither as visceral as \"Evil Dead Trap\" nor as cerebral and horrific as \"Kairo.\" Even so, my comment at \"Ringu\" manages to back into some strong praise. No one who has a chance in hell of seeing \"Ringu,\" even on a small screen, even your computer screen, should see this remake.What if Lynch had directed Watts in \"The Ring\"? If only he had! Maybe draw a rule of thumb, something like this: Great directors can remake the works of hacks. Look at all the trashy mystery novels made into great films. Maybe hacks can remake great works. Roger Corman's Poe series. (Lucas' trashing of \"Hidden Fortress\" must be the exception that proves the rule. Oops! No! Here's another one: Besson doing Jeanne d'Arc.) But hacks probably shouldn't remake the work of hacks. \"Ringu\" simply doesn't support a careless, overly faithful remake like this one.'\n",

Why? because once you see one of them you begin having expectations for the other. Once one scares the crap out of you do you really believe the other one is going to scare you as much?? For those of us that did not see Ringu first, this was the horror movie we have all been waiting for. No pyschos with knives. No blood/gore. I found in some of the comments that this movie was unoriginal and in some of the other comments the movie did not follow the horror guidelines...well those two statements are pretty much contradictory which means those people are just blabbing for attention. If you are looking for an original horror movie i guess you can count out scream 1, 2, and 3, all the Friday the 13th and Jason movies, all the psycho movies ie. Silence of the Lambs, etc. Is it possible for a horror movie to be original?? The Ring is about as close as you can get to original.And now to blast away the people who gave negative reviews even further. Most of us know that what we fear the most is the unknown. The origin of Samara and her powers are not revealed to us. But honestly do we have to know? Many things do not need explained but will still scare the crap out of people. If you ever thought you saw a ghost you would neither care or think about how it got there and you would be scared out of your wits. Why are you scared? Because most supernatural phenomena cannot be explained and you cannot possibly understand it. Samara is pure evil...that is all we need to know to be scared of her...the most dreadful sadistic girl you can imagine. She has the frightening ability to burn horrific images into your mind and drive you crazy, all the while you feel your death approaching. This is how scary Samara is...and how scary the movie is. And you don't even need to know a thing about Samara to be scared.The story of this movie is actually well thought of. Contrary to what you may read in some of the negative reviews, this movie does have a great story and is not exactly difficult to follow. I saw one review where one person said that the movie never explained the chronology of events about the horses and how the child, Samara, affected the horses. Are you kidding?? This was fully explained. Anna Morgan was driven insane by the images Samara was revealing to her in her mind. Anna and Richard Morgan decided to banish Samara to their barn, hoping the separation would help stop all of it. While Samara was in the barn, she grew annoyed of the horses and decided to drive them insane. This was an act of revenge for being put in the barn.Now lets talk about the two things that make up a great movie...story and acting. The story is pretty much original, especially the scare tactics. Some of you say they are cheap. Cheap????? They scared the crap out of me. Quick flashes of distorted faces and horrific images do not allow the brain to settle/desensitize. Seconds or Minutes after each \"scare\" that one quick moment is etched into your mind...the summation of all these moments is the main reason why many of us are still scared of this movie even 10 days after we first watched it. The split-second shots of katie's face and Samara's eye did it for me. The storyline is understandable. Some of these people comment about how the story just doesn't make sense. Well I'm sure if they popped in the movie one more time and stopped whining about how this isn't a Friday the 13th or Scream Stabber movie, they would be able to follow the story pretty easily. As for the acting...well Naomi Watts was perfect and the others, while not being excellent, did an good enough job to where their bad acting did not take away from the film.Because this film has the originality that most horror films do not, and because this movie scared the crap out of me, i have no choice but to give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating'\n",

            "Review: 'This American remake of a Japanese inexpensive but ambitious horror, Ringu, shows what Hollywood can do in order to give a film production a better surface. The U.S. version, The Ring, arguably has a better content of the cursed videotape, with an apparent influence from the surrealism. The viewers may be more easily identified with The Ring's Noah (Martin Henderson), who is skeptical about supernatural phenomena, than with Ringu's Ryoji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who possesses an ESP. In The Ring, the protagonist's son Aidan (David Dorfman) has more significant role, in both storytelling and creating the atmosphere (wearing the archetypical Hollywood's horror-flick makeup), than the Japanese counterpart does. Several details added in the American version (e.g., a horse jumping into the sea from a ferry) deepen the backdrop, while the post-production that manipulates the pictures into a blue tone generates a chilly mood. Overall, in this case, what Hollywood offers works, resulting in making a more polished entertainment.'\n",

Naomi Watt's son in the movie was very creepy however and he really stood out in my mind. The creepiest and positively the coolest aspect of this movie was the contents of the video tape like a woman brushing her hair, a ladder and a girl in a mirror. Only the ring can make the nicest things seem so horrifying. The girl popping out of the video tape and the phone ringing saying \"seven days\" helped the movie a lot too. The very beginning and the very end were the coolest parts of the movie. The only downside to this movie was that the entire movie wasn't plain horror and suspense.

The Ring has one of those great moody plots that is never resolved and is filled to the brim with dark images, shriek-inducing scares, and almost no time to breathe. It revolves around a reporter who investigates a VHS tape that kills anyone who watches it after 7 days prior to the viewing. The actual tape makes no sense the first time you watch it in the movie, with avant-garde shots of a ladder, a woman brushing her hair in a mirror, and much more. But as the mystery unfolds everything starts to fall into place, but will our heroine have time to uncover the biggest secret of all before her 7 days run out? Tension is raised with some help from a 'cinema cooking timer' of sorts that tells you how many days she has left. The only thing I have to say about this movie, and it isn't really negative, is that it tries to be a lot like The Sixth Sense. Think about it. It has a somber, depressed tone where everything is a dark black or blue, an eerie little boy who hears voices, and an ending that tries to be shocking by revealing the clues we might have missed. I think The Sixth Sense definitely had a better ending, since The Ring confused me somewhat before the credits finally rolled, but it still succeeded in making me think twice about shadows in the corner or strange sights at the corner of my eye. It doesn't take much to creep me out, and The Ring sufficiently scared the bejeezus out of me. I give it 4/4 stars.'\n",

            "Review: 'After her pitch perfect emotionally devastating performance in 2001's \"Mulholland Drive\". Naomi Watts comes up with another triumphant film, which is \"The Ring\". Although \"The Ring\" is not as powerful and inspiring as \"Mulholland Drive\". \"The Ring\" deserves the highest possible accolade as well.The direction is simply superb. Once you see this movie, it gets its hooks in you. I saw it at midnight about two months ago, and I thought I'd fall asleep, but I didn't. The story was so clever, that it doesn't let people close their eyes for a minute. The opening sequences are excellent; you really understand the story once you see them. You see two young girls kidding each other about the videotape that supposedly kills people, and they find out it's true and then they get killed. Then, Naomi Watts' presence in the film makes you watch without getting bored or annoyed for a second. The surrealistic video is so interesting, as well as the whole story. It's not a movie in which monsters kill others, but a psychological horror story that'll make you think a great deal about the complexity of Samara's personality.  It also has the most unpredictable and brilliant scenes in film history. For instance the scene where the horse is chasing Naomi's character is great. You'd never expect that. You say in your mind, \"Wait! It's not her time to die yet\". This scene is so full of horror, mystery, seriousness, etc. Another excellent scene is when she tries to find out about Samara's life and then a man kills himself in the bathroom. However, the best and scariest of all is when Rachel falls into the well and also when Samara gets out of the TV. What scenes! Besides its wonderful and dark photography, and strong acting by the majority of the cast, this shows the dark side of a little girl who could be so tender, but has reasons to kill even the nicest person. It'll make you think of how far a person can go because of being ignored by their family or other people. The final scenes are very unexpected, and understandable. If you really pay attention to this movie you'll understand the whole thing. Without a doubt \"The Ring\" is one of the most interesting and clever psychological horror movies ever made! I could say it's the best movie of 2002, since most of 2002 movies are very bad. An example would be the corny \"The Hours\" and the overrated \"Lord of the Rings\". Naomi Watts has become one of my favorite actresses. She's reached perfection and respect with \"Mulholland Drive\" and \"The Ring\". She's given the roles of a lifetime, and she'll be getting fantastic offers, which she obviously deserves.  8.5/10'\n",

It's difficult to describe the plot without giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that the story of a reporter named Reiko who investigates the mysterious death of her cousin, only to discover a videotape that kills people seven days after they have watched it will scare the pants off you. The American makers of the The Ring wisely chose to retain the best elements of the original story, but what they forgot to include were the thrills and chills. There are some minor shocks, and one sequence that will upset horse lovers everywhere, but the overall sense of tension that is so pervasive in the original is lacking. Naomi Watts (last seen in Mulholland Drive) is the best reason to see this movie. She's natural and believable, and even though she is in virtually every scene, seems underused. This whole exercise might have been more interesting if a director who specialized in making horror and suspense films  like M. Night Shyamalan or David Cronenberg  had been given a crack at the material.'\n",

Naomi Watts is not that good of an actress and every scene that she is in, she seems rather snobby and stuck-up acting, even around the little boy (who is not like the kid in Ring Virus, more like the kid in Sixth Sense). While Korean actress Eun-Kyung Shin did a lot more better job and seemed much more emotional and caring.Another thing, though I think Daviegh Chase is a cute actress, she is just way too young for her role in this movie as Samara. Usually, the actresses whom played Sadako/Eun-Suh have been at least in their young adult years, but Chase was only 11 or 12 while playing this role. Does anyone find that a little disturbing besides me?And then there is the video. In \"Ring Virus\", it was made out to look sweet and innocent on purpose, because sometimes the scariest of things can be something that can look cute and innocent at first, but then lash out at you later. In this version, the video is just about as \"chilling\" as a Marilyn Manson music video.And the idea of a sequel and never crediting the original creator is quite a crying shame....'\n",

It is just a good story that is very supernatural  dark and brooding.All and all the audience was riveted to this film.  The second viewing of this film most of the loose ends can be figured out.  Slight spoiler: The film has an excellent payoff, better to me than 6th Sense or the Others. But I would have liked it to go on longer perhaps for a final confrontation if you know what I mean!  I hope the sequel doesn't ruin it.  One thing: the seven days to death after seeing the video tape may also refer to those of us who rent the Ring.  Chill!'\n",

            "Review: 'I absolutely hated this film. First off, the acting was atrocious. I have not seen such a miscast group in a very long time. The children were overly cute, the female lead spent more time worrying about her hair than studying the character, and I'm pretty sure the male lead was a model. They were stiff and wooden, and entirely unconvincing. Every emotion was overdone; I felt as if I were watching theatre (and not in the good way). And the lead female character was a total monster (which was a complete departure from the original). That actress butchered that part, being calm on second, hysterical the next, flirting with her ex-husband and showing no real personality under the surface of classic modern sarcastic bitchiness.The direction was brutal. A good director could have at least made some improvement in the acting, but sometimes I got the feeling that no one had even screened the film after it was made. In on scene, the mother enters her son's bedroom, looks at his bed, and the shot of what was supposed to be her line of vision was actually at ceiling height looking down. And oh my God the dialog. I wrote better dialog in stories when I was eight. Predictable, simple and completely lacking any flow. It was also overly flirty and sarcastic a la Dawson's Creek, that distracted the viewer from even the possibility of setting a suspenseful mood. Which then brings me to the unbelievably annoying subplot of the rekindled romance between the two leads. Totally unnecessary and so nauseatingly Hollywood. Once again we find a director who falls back on ridiculous notions of sexualization for the sole purpose of fattening up weak material, and subsequently failing miserably. Then we come to the plot problems. While the film overexplained a million tiny details, it ignored numerous necessary points, such as the chronology of the horse family's events, and the girl's psychic abilities. She obviously could control events/actions with her mind, yet there wasn't even an attempt to explain how. Also there was a complete lack of explanation of where the girl came from and/or why she was evil. Yet the film spoon fed certain details to the audience, to the point of choking. Us hearing the voice on the phone, the extended first death scene, the water oozing out of the television, what was up with that whole Before you die you see the ring nonsense? Which was, incidentally, totally inconsistent as the boyfriend was not drawing on magazine faces or scribbling circles before he died! And what was with that stupid female lead getting knocked into the well? Most rediculous scene ever! And then we come to the ending, which was so obviously complete left open for a sequel, and in doing so, dropped all moral implications of the tape. Instead of the ending in Ring (where the mother asks her father to watch the film and die, giving up his life to save that of his grandchild, and effectively ending the cycle), in the remake, they imply that all that matters is saving the son, regardless of who sees the film and if the cycle continues. It is appalling that this film was able to be made.'\n",

            "First off I would like to address what most anal movie watchers on here have. Yes this is an American remake to a 1998 Japanese film. But why are we complaining? In Japan the made a prequel and a sequel in no time to that movie, and Korea made their own remake of it, so America isn't \"evil\" for remaking it. Why don't you people grow up and quit complaining if a movie is remade? A movie is a movie is a movie, it's either good or bad, no matter where the plot came from.The Ring is about an urban legend of a tape that after you watch it, you get a phone call saying that you will die in a week. And then *drumroll* a week later you die. Of course the characters in the film try to unlock the mystery of the origins of this tape.The contents on the killer video are an array of haunting images, all of them look like they were inspired by surrelist movies. The rest of the movie has a very isolated look to it, adding to the eerieness of the film. All of this is shot beautifully, crisp, clean you don't want to take your eyes off of this movie. The best thing about the movie was the ending. There is a point in which events happen to make you believe that the movie is over and will end with a typical PG-13 horror film ending, but no...it adds a little more...and those ending scenes took me by surprise (I could tell by audience reaction, it took them by surprise too).If you're looking for a beautiful looking, well crafted, well acted, damn scary movie, then I suggest you go see The Ring...you may never look at VHS the same way again.'\n",

However, it can't escape the cliches by touching all the twisted imagination buttons ever created throughout the movie history. As a person who has done with supernatural crap long time ago, I expected some intelligence after seeing Naomi Watts on the cast. Indeed, she was the reason for me to spare some time for this genre but the end result was total disappointment. The part involving the research about Anne Morgan looked promising for a while but towards the finale, nails coming off the walls by themselves, a zombie girl climbing out of a well and then coming out of a CRT screen to scare people to death... Those were all too much occults marring a flimsy story which was struggling to be coherent up to that moment anyway. I also read that the director initially wanted to avoid big names from the cast with the idea of movie being discovered by itself (well, if you believe it...) Sorry for dashing your dreams pal, but this is just another run off the mill horror flick who'd never find this much success but for Watts. As for the movie itself, the storytelling is patchy and lacks cohesion. Some reviewers complain about the lack of character development but I guess this would be too much to expect from a horror movie, anyhow. I should finally give the director some credit that by using blood and gore sparingly, he acted wisely enough to jack up the creepiness level a notch high.'\n",

            "Review: '\"The Ring\" has acquired a reputation.  When you watch the commercials on T.V. with these teenagers wearing the \"cool & hip\" brands of clothes, that have spiky hair, and that look like clones taken from the legion of main-stream teenagers of America saying: \"It's the scariest film I've ever seen!\", you should know what \"The Ring\" really is.  This is a remake of the Japanese film entitled \"Ringu\", released in 1998, so if I counted well, four years ago.  And they do a remake.  But wait, the word \"remake\" is not really appropriate here.  I would say Amercian version.  Americans (in general) are not very opened to difference...and let me tell you that, for those who've seen some, a Japanese film is totally different from an American film...the acting is completely another thing, as well as the directing.  Personally, I haven't seen \"Ringu\", but I don't care.  I've seen \"The Ring\", and that's enough, even though I would have preferred to see \"Ringu\" instead.Here's a little overview of the movie: A woman investigates on the mysterious death of her niece, who apparently died after watching a video cassette.  She watches it, and it contains several successive images that don't really seem to have a meaning.  But, going further in her investigation, she discovers the origins of the tape and the meaning of every image.  But things get more complicated (and confused!) when she learns that she only has seven days to live after the viewing.  So, that gives her seven days to find the solution.  Original? A little.  Scary? Unfortunately, a little.  The only scary part of this film lasts about one minute and a half, and it's the viewing of the tape.  It's mysterious, creepy, and great.  THAT part was nice, and it somehow gave me shivers. But that's it.  Actually, that's the only creepy part because that's the only one where we truly disconnect from reality.  The rest of the film keeps a tone that I would describe as too sober for that kind of film.  I mean, there are surnatural events, but they are either very ordinary (in horror films) or flawed.  (Spoilers) Yes, seeing a woman going out of the television is not such a bad concept, it can be used cleverly and give a good scare, but, first, we saw it many times in other films (and I don't really consider that as a problem, because any idea can be used dozens of times and still be original, it all depends on the way it is delivered) and also, in \"The Ring\", the directing is not good enough to make it scary. Another thing is the constant use of sound to make the audience jump out of their seats.  Okay, you can use it once, or twice, in very special occasions, and it will work...but in \"The Ring\", they overuse it, I mean, they always put a loud sound effect for any action the character is doing, that's gratuitous.  If I hadn't seen it in a theater, it would not have been the same film.  Those who will see it at home better have an excellent surround sound system, because in the opposite case, they'll fall asleep. The key of a great and truly scary horror film is the atmosphere.  It has to be constantly creepy, to keep the audience in the mood, and that's what I meant by \"a sober tone\".  Yes, one minute you start going in the mood of the film, but the first thing you know is that, thirty seconds later, you come back to reality, and the audience's progress is ruined.  The ending tries to mix up reality and the horror, but it seems like the reality tone is stronger, and that ruins the whole potential of the film.  Those who want to see the creepiest film ever, and also one of the most brilliant films should definitely watch Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\".The directing by Gore Verbinski is ordinary, except, once again, for that minute and a half of bizarre and creepy images.  He seems to like giving us fake scares (like playing a creepy background music and showing the heroin getting near a door and opening it slowly, making us believe that something horrible is hidden behind it and that we're going to jump off our seats when we see what it is (and, just a little comment, these days it's not even the image itself that scares, it's the sudden loud sound) and simply not doing it, so he fools us, creating mild suspense and trying to avoid cliches).\n",
            "The acting is average.  The little boy tries to scare us with his constant neutral facial expression, but fails.  Usually, a boy of that kind in an horror film is one of the scariest aspects of it, but in this case, he simply doesn't fit, and he simply has no importance.  He's not quite Danny Torrance (played by Danny Lloyd, in \"The Shining\"), let me tell you that. The other actors are okay, there is not much to mention about them.\n",
            "The plot is needlessly complex.  It tries to be complicated and everything, and in the end you realize it cannot explain itself.  Somebody explain to me the nosebleeds, why the boy can talk to the girl from the tape, the hose jumping off the boat...they put lots of weird things, explain some of them, and try to make us forget the other ones they can't explain. For a good plot in an \"horror\" film, see Bill Paxton's \"Frailty\", it is a hundred times better, and it really works!  It unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case for \"The Ring\".I've read the discussion forums for this film on IMDb.  One of them was \"The Ring is the scariest film of the last twenty years\".  That's ridiculous.  Those who say that have truly been hypnotized by Hollywood. \"The Ring\" happens to be a very overrated film that a generation of ignorants will find truly scary because they haven't seen anything else and have no cinematic culture...someone that says \"The Ring\" is the scariest film doesn't know anything about foreign or underground films...they only watch Hollywood blockbuster crap that is to cinema what McDonald's is to food...Last year, there's been a much scarier movie than that, and it IS a Hollywood film, I'm talking about \"Frailty\", from Bill Paxton...excellent film.  Anyone remembers \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" from Coppola?  That was beautiful and creepy...that was not junk...\"Interview With The Vampire\", from Neil Jordan, anyone?  Yes, it seems that these years (and I mean from 1996 to today) horror films have taken an atrocious turn into the category of SUSPENSE movies, which are a totally different thing....Wes Craven's Scream (an awful film, by the way) is a SUSPENSE, not an horror film! And, again, they had to ruin good things even worse, so they made awful suspense films with monsters or ghosts in them, and they wrapped it with leading actors and actresses with bigger chests than talent, and they've got a Box Office success that every ignorant North-American will find scary...congratulations...Anyone who thinks he or she loves horror movies has to watch \"The Shining\"...if you don't find it scary, then you don't know what a REAL horror movie is.  Before I see \"The Ring\" again, it will see mine, if you know what I mean.Overall, it is a very ordinary thriller, with some suspense, brief horror scenes, and it is a flawed horror film.  At least it really tried to be a horror film, and ruined itself.  It is average, deceiving in the thrill factor, but it still has better entertainment value than the majority of today's horror flicks from Hollywood...5/10'\n",

I'll give it the same those people gave it- they prefer it because: 1) The story line is more thought out.2) The effects are better in consequence to it being thought out more. For example, the victims rot as if being in the well. 3) After the deaths the movie cuts as if it was the end of the video, whereas the original had photograph negatives which many people found to be corny. I on the other hand, though I liked the remake's touch better, didn't find anything wrong with using the negative's effect. It rather suited the original.         If it weren't for such strange mutations of the storyline, I might agree this was the rare case in which the Hollywood remake was better than it's original. But the deal with the horses (especially the one jumping off the boat) didn't live up to it's original. There's no sign of a supernatural superstitious force, which makes the original much creepier. You don't know anything of the girl's father, and the mother was now talking english to her horse instead of another language to the girl's real father (from what I understood of it). So Samara just comes out as a normal angst ridden pre-adolescent who causes trouble. You don't see the hidden connection to the supernatural power which made her able to attack her victems through a video and make them suffer as she did.         And apart from that, the acting wasn't all that well either. The people were rude and unbearable (I'm certain not everyone acts this way in America). Part of the problem has to do with the dialogue. I'm sure Rachel wasn't meant to sound so rude when she said \"Excuse me, but what the hell are you talking about?\". She seems to catch on easily to the other clues in her way, surely she would be smart enough to catch on to what that woman was saying. In the original, her ex-husband gave her the clues. In this one he is just there and does very little.  You can't feel; the tension between him and his son either. Instead they talk about it- one of the faults of American acting. You should know what's going on by watching, not hearing.           But the worse thing is the failing attempts at comic release which certainly had no place in the film. Running with the hose and falling is one example. It just made the whole thing seem stupid.'\n",

            "Review: 'After enduring horror film after horror film from the 90's that paraded senseless violence and vacuous plots, I was severely concerned about the health of the genre.  From the late 90's until today, it's been even worse: we have films like _The Sixth Sense_ and _Frailty_ which purport to be intelligent but are little more than cheap cinematic jack-in-the-boxes that shout \"Boo!\" at the end.  Keeping that in mind, my standards for a horror film these days have been correspondingly low.  Now, along comes _The Ring_, and all that is blown away.Not only does this film have a fantastic story (for once, EVER, we have a ghost story that EXPLAINS the ghost's activity), but the acting is first rate.  The casting of Watts, whose intensity was integral to the success of _Mullholland Drive_, is nothing short of genius.  Such talent in a horror film is risky, but pays off in the emotional punch and urgency of Watt's performance.And of course, this movie would be almost laughable without the right look. Every person involved with the visuals audio here took the utmost care to get it in sync with the emotional tone of the film.  The result is that unlike _Rosemary's Baby_ or similar films, you never get a break from the mounting tension and sense of doom surrounding Rachel Keller.  Very effective.This should be a lesson to everyone involved with _Scream_, _The Sixth Sense_, _Frailty_, _I Know What You Did Last Summer_, and all that other crap: WE ARE ADULTS IN THE AUDIENCE.  WE CAN HANDLE IT IF YOU MAKE A FILM THAT IS ARTFUL AND REQUIRES THOUGHT.  Of course, this one has a surprising ending too, but (horror of horrors) it actually makes sense and clears up some earlier ambiguities in the movie that the movie goer had thought resolved (which, Mr. M. Night, is how surprise endings are supposed to work.)If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.  One thing though: don't go to the theater and then scream like a little girl every time something scary happens.

            "Review: 'This is a US remake of a Japanese remake of a Korean remake of a Korean TV movie based on a novel called Ringu.Right 4 perfectly healthy teenagers die on the same night after watching a weird videotape with a ring on it. A journalist who is an aunt of one of the teenagers who died investigates it, finds the videotape and watches it. Then she receives a weird phone call.This wasn't as scary as people made it out to be. Seriously there were a few jump scenes but nothing that would keep you from sleeping.The best performance is from the sexy Naomi Watts (Children of the Corn 4) who plays Rachel Keller the journalist. Her acting was outstanding though Martin Henderson's (that dumb aussie soap Home and Away) and Brian Cox's (Manhunter: Red Dragon) performances were also notable.If this film wasn't cleverly made I would have crucified it and made it out to be terrible. It has a good plot twist but that doesn't make great horror. 6 out of 10.'\n",

            "Review: 'Actual horror has become a lost art lately, probably drowned in the flood of teen slasher flicks with pop soundtracks.  It's become the norm that horror movies are out to make you laugh rather than scare you, as if the filmmakers don't want to be seen taking it seriously.  As happened when it was time to save the American action film, Hollywood looked to Asia, and here we have a remake of a Japanese film which has already seen a remake in Korea.I'd seen the other two before walking in on this version, so perhaps I'm not qualified to talk about whether the plot is inventive or surprising, being intimately familiar with the story already.  What I can say is that this version stacks up very favorably.  Whether consciously or not, it has taken some of the most interesting elements of both version, and added in a few little twists of its own.  The backstory has been fleshed out a bit more extensively as well.  The look of the film is excellent, using a washed-out, desaturated color pallette to create an oppressive tone (admittedly not difficult in Seattle in the winter).  Director Verbinski (director of MOUSEHUNT?!) does excellent work, allowing scenes to play out slowly, refusing to generate false excitement with jarring editing tricks like most modern horror directors.The bottom line, of course, is \"Is it scary?\".  Well, I knew every turn of the plot right up to the end, and it still had me nervous, creeped out, and on the edge of my seat.  This is a perfect horror film, a thing we see all too little of these days.  If you have any fondness for the genre, you must see this film, and let Hollywood know that this is how it should be done.'\n",

The horror was just fine for me-not too extreme like \"The Evil Dead\", \"Zombie\", and Biohazard-kill and eat them all kind of movies but rather mysterious and even cerebral. I have to say I liked it. It has its weak points, but it doesnft fail to hold your attention till the end.The film is about killer videotape: the one who watches it immediately receives a telephone call with a voice just saying \"Seven Days\". Seven days after this phone call, you die. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) after seeing the tape has to save her life within those seven days. Intriguing enough isn't it. And not just the plot but also the camerawork, photography and the whole decor were fantastic. I will just say that I was looking forward to see the content of this videotape and to my opinion it was awesome-one of the creepiest things Ifve ever seen. However, there were some flaws Ifd like to share with those who saw the movie already:***SPOILERS AHEAD***First of all, Who builds a house over a well? We don't where I come from that's for sure. But this is a small one. A major flaw is the reasoning behind who lives after seeing the tape and who dies. In the movie Rachel made a copy of the tape and destroyed the original. Believing that making a copy keeps you alive she made her son make a copy of his own. The last line from that movie was when he asked her what was going to happen to those they were going to show the tape to. If we conclude that in order to stay alive you have to make a copy of the tape plus show it to somebody else, everything could end very fast. They just have to show the tape to somebody (say with AIDS, cancer, 90 years old or just anybody) and then destroy it.\n",

It wasn't scary so much as it was disorienting- the odd bluish-grayish-greenish coloring of the backgrounds contrasted with the normal appearance of the actors and actresses, for example. I also liked the way it begins- a few strange happenings which, by themselves, were apparently harmless but which taken together indicated strange things were afoot. The film as a whole is actually a hybrid- part horror, part detective story.The ending was good, too- the mother and her son having been spared because she made a copy of the video, thus helping the vengeful spirit of the child to \"be heard,\" and yet with the implication that now they must show the video to others, who will in all likelihood become victims themselves.The soundtrack was another plus- the tinkling, slow piano seemed almost wistful and sad.One thing I hated: David Dorfman's portrayal of the son, Aidan. Rory Culkin already did this in \"Signs\" (a film I despise,) and Dorfman gives it to us again: yet another big eyed, nauseously precocious brat who talks like a grownup and possesses the secret knowledge of whatever is wrong. It's too bad a kid like this couldn't have gone to work for the Government years ago- he could probably have told us all about North Korea's nuclear weapons program before Kim Jong-Il approved it.'\n",

As is usual, it takes a certain type of person to appreciate it for what it really is, and those who were more than content with it likely didn't bother to comment on it here. So you can disregard just about ever negative post here, since you have to really go out and see it for yourself to make that judgement.Regardless, The Ring is an excellent flick with a winning idea behind it. It has a symbol (the ring itself, of course) and what has to be one of the most original plot lines anyone has seen. A video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it, subliminal hints at what will become your ultimate fait, and a truly unique character to be afraid of. Yes, it will leave a lot of loose ends untied at the end, but that's the point. You will remain affected by this movie long after you have finished watching it.This is a deserving addition to really everyone's home library, whether you thought it was just 'okay' or utterly fantastic. It's truly a one-in-a-million movie, much like The Sixth Sense, Titanic and Poltergeist. Don't pass this one up. At least bother to see it once before giving up hope.Anyway, to wrap things up, this instantly became one of my favorite movies and has all the fixings of a well-done theatrical feature. And I really, really hope they slap on a sequel to clear up some of the confusion that seems to be plagueing a lot of watchers. Excellent, fantastically done movie.Before you die, you see the ring.'\n",

I went to go see it in the afternoon so that I could have a good night sleep, instead of waking up horrified from a dream the involved a gruesome little girl coming out of a tv, so that's why I went to go see it in the afternoon!When you see the movie, at first you think: \"Wow, that was freaky!\" after jumping up from your seat, but then, the movie has this way of sticking in your subconscious.  I couldn't even go by my TV at home after watching \"The Ring\" withought thinking about that little girl!  And man was I terrified! Even looking in one of my mirrors at home ( which looks like the same mirror that you see Samara's (the little girl) mother brushing her hair! No joke, it's a crazy coincidence! I almost flipped after realising it!) just gave me goosebumps!Because of that movie, I also experienced one of the most scariest moments of my life, what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth, I not just saying it so that I can make the movie look good or anything, but it's really scary, and just goes to show that the movie was so well maid, that it had that much of an impact on me!Ok, it's not that long of a story, all that happened, was that I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night (approx. 3:00 in the morning) and had a nose bleed! This was on the same week that I just watched the ring, as if it was one of those signs that I was going to die.  No this was not a dream, my brother ask me the next morning what I was doing up in the middle of the night!So anyway, very freaky!

Lastly, the script needed more work. (SPOILER ALERT ON) What happens if you watch the tape and there isn't a phone around? Also the phone always JUST HAPPENS to ring after the tape was watched, usually it was just a fake-out. The used this too many times. My big question: what time period was the little girl living in? The costumes certainly make this very unclear. Another question: how did the women know that failing down the well or watching the other tape wasn't what broke the curse?

Some movies leave you scratching your head, but The Ring only leaves you scratching your derriere.  This is such an helter-skelter exercise in everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink screenwriting that you've quit trying to make sense of things long before the credits roll.  I'm tempted to call the writing adolescent, but that's a disservice to the adolescents in the audience whom I saw the film with: they were snickering at this ludicrous movie long before the adults caught on to what a stinker we were in for.Somebody poured a lot of money into this silly mess, though, and it shows on the screen.  The film is crafted with the care of overwrought appetizers served at an uptown art opening.  Every beam of light is in place, and the camera adopts stylish angles, almost none of which are relevant to the storytelling, but which fill the viewer with the same vulgar pleasure as watching a well-made beer commercial.It isn't all bad, though.  The dripping, creepy images -- centipedes, drowned children, and more -- can't help but effect you on a visceral level. It's just not storytelling.  It's cinema as a series of moody vignettes with the story as an afterthought to try to justify the endeavor according to classical moviemaking tenets.  The Ring is the horror movie equivalent of softcore:  a guilty pleasure that isn't.'\n",

I have to disagree with people who have said it relied on run of the mill scare techniques. The story was compelling. I was sure that the video was going to be some mish mash of unexplained ambiguous crap meant only to scare and disgust the audience. Instead it's like a map of clues, albeit deadly ones. They didn't come right out and mention psychic photography, but that is what I believe it was. You see that when they show the negatives from her file. In the beginning, the teenager says they put a tape in that was supposed to have been football. Instead a bunch of strange images appear. These were images from the ghost of a girl capable of psychic photography. That was compelling in and of itself. The reporter follows the visual clues which lead her to the body of the girl and you assume that once she's peacefully buried it will all be over. This is what most ghost movies end up being. I was sitting there thinking...why would she kill innocent people...when the woman's son drops the bomb about \"why did you let her out of the dark place you weren't supposed to\". A lot of people haven't understood why her son had to make a copy or why she lived because she did. It's simple she gave the girl a victim, her son's father. The chilling part was the question the boy posed of \"What happens to the person we show the video too?\" Theoretically the cycle can end by the woman being smart enough to say. Hey watch this and make a copy of it....etc etc. I was uneasy after watching it, but not terrified. It's well worth watching.'\n",

My curiosity, however, was piqued. My friend and I then rented Ring and Ring 2 to see how the Japanese versions stacked up. We watched them in her lounge room, alone, with the lights turned off, yet neither movie elicited in either of us the same response as the American version. To my, perhaps overly westernised view, each contained only one truly scary scene, in the first, the 'Sadako leaves the TV' scene, and in the second a scene where Anna appears as an oblivious ghost, but then turns around and looks at the main character.I then read all the information I could find on the net, and then one day in Borders I saw the book had finally been translated and published here. It was a great read, very different from the movies, and, apart from being incredibly sexist (all the women in it are either evil or insipid, the Rachel Character is, of course, a man) one of the best contemporary stories I have ever read.However, it opened my eyes to a plot hole I had ignored in the movies, which is; if Sadako/Samara wants everyone to know her pain and spread it like a sickness, why would she not SAY SO? In the book, the video is like a chain letter, featuring a \"If you do not pass this on within 7 days, you will die\" type warning, however, that part has been taped over by the teenagers as a prank. Apart from that, and the odd inclusion of horses, and the fact that the DVD has a trailer of Catch Me If You Can as a Special Feature, it is a very scary, well done movie with brilliant sound and lighting, and a breath-takingly chilling performance by Daveigh Chase. Some of the story changes, such as Samara's mother being the one who put her in the well, and of Samara being killed when she was still a child, were good choices for this film. Someone said here that the end is a disappointing sequel chaser, which is missing the whole point of any of the movies, and certainly of the original story- which was that \"it won't stop\". It will spread throughout the world like a virus, replicating a re-replicating itself until everyone has experienced the horror of Sadako.'\n",

            "Review: 'I have to say that I am a big fan of horror movies and when such a movie comes along that is done right, it gets really exciting.  THE RING is a great thriller that really gets your blood pumping.  Each scene is one suspense master after the next.A great thing about this movie is the fact that there is actually some thought in it.  The plot advances as the film goes, which is usually unlikely in horror movies and to my surprise this film did not base its scares on gore (for the most part).I have heard some people compare this movie to this years earlier release FEARDOTCOM.  This movie is nothing like FEARDOTCOM and to compare it to such a horribly made movie is an insult.  THE RING takes the audience and while proving to be an effectively scary movie, it really keeps you interested from start to finish.My only complaint about this movie is that there are a lot of questions that were never answered, or things that just did not make sense.  The movie ends with a great compilation scene however, you realize that there are a lot of holes that did not fill.  Although, it did make for great discussion on the way home.This movie will definitely be on my to buy list and is quite worth the price of admissionA great horror flick but because of the unanswered points to the movie I give THE RING a 8/10'\n",

The two main reasons behind me wanting to see the movie were :1) It was around Halloween & I wanted to see a scary movie 2) I had seen Mulholland Dr. and really liked Naomi Watts' performanceWith that in mind, I expected the film to be decent.But the film was much more than decent. It was downright creepy. Very creepy. It's important to understand the difference between \"scary\" and \"creepy\". Scary can be accomplished in a matter of seconds (someone jumping out from behind a wall with a knife). Creepy is something that takes a while to accomplish in a film. It takes a long time on the part of the director. It requires more attention and time on the part of the viewer. This film managed to accomplish creepy very well. It reminded me of the older generation of horror films, which managed to grab you in a way that was very psychological (\"The Omen\", \"Rosemary's Baby\", and of course \"The Exorcist\"). Those types of horror are the ones that always stick with me. They are the ones that endure. They are the ones that I inevitably have to watch for at least a little bit when I pass them on late night cable even though I have seen them countless times.creepy filmvery well madeone of the best films of 2002'\n",

I saw the Ring, and I was disturbed beyond belief. I still see the image of that little girl in my head.It seems that the Japanese are really imaginative. In fact, a few of my favorite movies originated in Japan (The Seven Samurai, Akira, and now the Ring). The writer of this story is up in the ranks of Stephen King.The actors were great, especially since this is the first movie I've seen them all in. That little girl is the creepiest thing in the world.What I like most about this movie is that it actually scares you. Unlike other supernatural movies (which usually end up as plotless gory bloodbaths), this one has a story, and scares the living feces out of you.This movie also plays with your mind a little bit, which is always good in a movie like this.The video sequence was the most disturbing thing in the movie. There's something about black and white freaky images that really engraves them into your mind.One thing I know. From now on, my entertainment comes from DVDs. I'm not gonna take a chance with a video cassette. If you have not yet seen this movie, you're in for the scarefest of your life.'\n",

Naomi Watts is intriguing as Rachel Keller, a journalist who investigates a scary videotape after her niece's death. When she receives a call after viewing the tape stating \"Seven Days\", Rachel realizes that this is no hoax, and that she must race against time before she meets the same fate. Uncovering a horrifying story as the days tick slowly away, Rachel realizes an unfathomable horror. Gore Verbinski kept this thriller's plot tight and the movie races satisfyingly to the unforgettable climax. \"The Ring\" ranks with \"The Exorcist\" as truly one of the most disturbing and scary movies ever.'\n",

            "Review: 'Standing on its own, The Ring is probably an above-average horror movie. Having said this, I'll admit that this review is biased toward the original Japanese version, Ringu. Believe me, I know that by reading most of the reviews on this film that a lot of people disagree with me. However, I tend to believe that the reason for this may be due to the fact that some of these people have seen the remake first which would kill the element of surprise in Ringu. The problems that I had with The Ring were its representation of the antagonist and some of the plot outlines throughout the movie. The whole aspect of the horse subplot was needless. Then, to add more to this, you have the horse and the ferry ride which still serves no real purpose to the movie except to add more time to the already overlong 116 minutes. And why are we always treated to the same \"I don't believe you\" to the \"you're right, something's going on\" scenario that seems to be always present in today's horror movies? At least with Ringu, the male role in that movie is smart enough at the start to realize that something out of the ordinary is going on, therefore, saving us from this cliché and moving us toward the rest of the story. And now we come to our antagonist, Sardona. This was a complete letdown for me. I know, again I'm comparing an original to a remake but it can't be helped -- Sardona doesn't hold a candle to Sadako's creepy demeanor.\n",
            "I'm not saying that this movie doesn't have its moments. The opening sequence really grabs you and made me think at the time that it could possibly surpass the original. Honestly, I would recommend The Ring if only for the fact of the beginning and parts of the third act. But I would also recommend seeing the original Ringu first in order to preserve the surprises.'\n",

I thought all the usual stuff you might think when a remake of one of your favorite movies is made... \"It'll never be as good as the original\" \"I'm sure they'll change tons of stuff to Americanize it\" etc, etc. Well now that I've finally seen it, the answer is yes and no.Yes, now we have a prettier version of the film and the story. For one thing, we have gorgeous Australian beauty Naomi Watts and her incredible big blue eyes, and even Samara (American version of Sadaku) is a little pretty little girl who can either charm you or kill you. But that is understandable, is America for Christ sake, you have to make everything pretty. For the most, the photography and the editing were just a little above average. And the horror scenes if not utterly excessive were faithful remakes of the originals. At the end, it reinforced the opinion the original gave me of television.For those who might not know by now, the story centers around a journalist who is investigating certain videotape that kills whoever sees it within a period of 7 days. So, she has only a week to find how to solve the mystery before she also dies under the curse of the video. Vengeance, despair, and children misunderstanding form part of what might as well become a new cult hit or one heck of a good contender for the golden raspberry.\n",

In this case, they tried to make the plot \"fool proof\"; I can't stand that even for the slightest little detail there has to be a sometimes stupid explanation or flashback and never leaving anything to the imagination, which sometimes is more frightening than actual visual aids (remember the Blair Witch?), and that is one of the beauties of the original, the mixture of suggestion versus visualization. And for the plot itself, the changes they made of the origins of Samara's evil were not convincing at all, I liked it better when Sadaku was more like a vengeance for what her mother suffered, over here is just a bad spawn.Overall I liked it, when the final climax came, my heart beat increased, and when I least expected it, I was at the edge of my seat even though I knew what was going to happen, and that shows how well it works.'\n",

Excellent acting, creepiness abounds, but it has problems.Why does every little kid in a horror film since \"Sixth sense\" have to be weird and creepy? \"Ringu\" drenched itself in some of the more obscure horror traditions, and resulted in a post-millenial update of Robert Chamber's book, \"The King In Yellow\". \"TKIY\" concerns a book so evil that those who read it, die. It's obscure these days, but it is highly regarded by the Lovecraft mythos afficianados. Along with this, \"Ringu\" dips heavily into the vocabulary of David Cronenberg, (more than any film since \"Demons 2\"!), and that really got me intrigued. This remake is easier to take, (no subtitles!), but it lacks some of the creepier aspects, and the adaptation of the original story seems foggy. I look forward to further remakes from this series, although the japanese have made several TV-movies tying in with this and that might be a bit much. \"Ringu 2\", and \"Ringu 0\" really fill in the story, and that would probably be a good thing. It's a good but somewhat confusing movie, with a fascinating history.

The Ring is an absolutely perfect film about the \"invisible\" which makes you scared. I think it has had a part in the movie-history with its innovation after the bloody horrors and own atmosphere which is the most depressing I have ever seen. Because you're afraid of something you cannot see.I was just 12 when I saw it the first time - everybody spoke about this film, how scary it is, and that it's a story about a tape which kills you when you watch it - and it was a memorable day for me. I had thought I would be afraid of it, but then I wouldn't. It was something else. With its blue-green hues and fantastic music has ever composed to a thriller, I just felt sadness and depress. And yeah, it was scary in an other way. But not in the word's normal meaning. It created such a kind of atmosphere that no movies have ever did and I think they won't. That's why it is a perfect creation. And this film is gonna be the movie like the X-Files which everybody saw and made them scared in their childhood.Having watched it I heard that it's a remake and years later I watched the original version. But I realized I don't care it's a remake. Who cares? The Ring is an excellent movie and to tell you the truth I didn't find the original film good. It was very different than the American version. It wasn't bad but the director understands the message in an other way than The Ring's. And Ringu is also based on a novel so it can be announced as a \"remake\" too. Two film, two messages.The most interesting thing about The Ring is that actually you cannot explain what you afraid of. Are you afraid of a tape? A simple object? Ridiculous. But it is the truth. A tape makes you scared. With its disturbing pictures, noises, sounds and elements. I think that this short movie is a kind of art work. Fantastic how the director can transform everyday happenings into disturbing elements. It could have won an Oscar.I like the actors playing. I think David Dorfman acts very well as a child, and I don't think we have to discuss anything about Naomi Watts. She is perfect too. Nothing overacting. And when I watched it years later when I became older I found another message about The Ring.I found it sad. It is a sad story. A mother kills her daughter. Why? Because the horses bear themselves nervous? That's not enough. It is a sad story because a mum cannot stand her kid and she feels the only way to be quit of is death. And then she commits suicide. A series of deaths. Because of a little girl. Lots of unexplainable happenings. And with them I've told almost nothing about the movie.And why is it scary? I have no answer.

As a result, I didn't know the story and so seeing this version of the story as my first view of the tale had the same effect on me (no doubt) as people who saw the Japanese original for the first time.I often believe that an original is better than it's remake ('The Vanishing', 'Yojimbo', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to name many). Let's not even bring 'The hitcher' into this discussion. In this case, however, the far superiour production values of the original make for a much scarier film than the original. I watched this version - the hairs stood up on my legs as I was watching it. I saw the original afterwards and it didn't have anyway near the same effect. Sure - you say - you knew what was coming! That's true - but then I watched this version again I had almost exactly the same sensation as when i watched it the first time.Why? That's easy. For a film to work you need to be willling to suspend your disbelief. For a horror film to be scary, this is even more important. The superior production values of the remake make it much easier to suspend your disbelief and therefore it is more effective as a horror piece. Compare one directly to the other and you;ll see that the story is in no way compromised - but that the characters are richer, the acting is better, the effects are way, way ,way, way better and the tension is even more drawn out.Simply put THIS is EXACTLY how to take an original film that used story to scare the bejesus out of you and then make a better film that has the same fundamental psychological effect. Those working on the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street' remake please, please, PLEASE take note.'\n",

            "Review: 'A combination of the visual chill of \"Stigmata\", the remote horror of \"The Blair Witch Project\", and the otherworldly, alien evils of H. P. Lovecraft, \"The Ring\" is a well-crafted, visually-arresting examination of how one act can inspire madness in everybody.  Naomi Watts is Rachel, a journalist who discovers that four teenagers, including her own cousin, have died a week to the day after watching a disturbing video tape.  Rachel tracks down the video and watches it herself. Immediately following the last frame of the video, she receives a phone call telling her that she will die in seven days.  Desperate to stop whatever is causing this, she enlists the aid of her ex-husband.  Her mission is fueled by the fact that her own son has also seen the video, and they are both being visited by a malevolent and insane entity.Watts is fantastic as Rachel, reminiscent of Nicole Kidman in \"The Others,\" a stable woman slowly losing her grip on the real world.  Gore Verbinski, a director who's previous work (\"The Mexican\") I could describe as wasteful, shocked and amazed me by the stunning visuals and sparse yet horrifying special effects.  The video itself is an emulation of the surrealism of Maya Deren and altogether disturbing by itself.  Other fine performances include Daveigh Chase (the voice of Lilo in \"Lilo & Stitch\") as a disturbed young girl who may be the entire key to the mystery of the malevolent video tape.I fault the movie briefly for David Dorfman's performance as Aidan, Rachel's son.  We have seen too many overly precocious, psychic children in horror movies since Haley Joel Osmont in \"The Sixth Sense.\"  Enough already.This was based upon an acclaimed Japanese thriller, and I would be highly curious to see what has been changed in the American version.  However, I would highly recommend \"The Ring\" for anyone looking for two hours of surreal, insinuatingly creepy horror.  9 out of 10.'\n",

            "Review: 'One of the few PG-13 flicks that actually managed to get under my skin! Adapted from Koji Suzuki's novel, a female reporter investigates the origins of a tape that supposedly kills you one week after watching it after her niece is the last supposed victim of the tape's deadly curse. This one is way better than its Japanese original, \"Ringu\", of which it was a remake of. For one thing, it's pace isn't as deathly boring and Verbinski directs the movie with more visual flair than his Japanese counterpart. There are some truly scary \"jump moments\" thrown in here and there that caught me completely off guard and the imagery in this film is top notch. The killer tape in this one actually IS unsettling, unlike the one in \"Ringu\", and Samara is 10 times scarier than her Japanese alter-ego Sadako. It's best to think of this as a supernatural detective story and I enjoyed not being able to predict where the movie was going, I was along for the whole ride, right down to terrific \"twist\" ending that is only one of few in recent memory that I didn't manage to see coming a mile away. An oppressed, dreadful and genuinely creepy atmosphere prevails throughout and is possibly the film's strongest asset...this one will get under your skin. Naomi Watts is excellent as well as everyone else involved in this. Often suffers from corniness however and the plot hits it's ups and downs along the way, but there is enough here to make up for it. Watch it...and be prepared to move the TV out of your bedroom before going to sleep at night!'\n",

But a few months ago, when it came out on HBO (or Starz, I forget which) I grabbed a bowl of popcorn and decided to watch. I personally loved it!! It's really such a scary movie but you can't get yourself to leave. Sometimes, I'd been grabbing onto my pillow and crying a little because I was so scared but there was no way I could go away and not watch it anymore. The acting is amazing and totally believable. And the story is very creative and is realistic and not at the same time. I mean, it's very unlikely for such a thing to happen, but at the same time...it could. There's no magic or monsters but rather videotapes and phone calls, which, when you're watching the movie, makes it all the more scary. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time, but be warned, you'll definitely have nightmares for a few days afterwards!'\n",

The trouble is, the more horror films I see, the less they manage to actually frighten me. And, to me, that's rather the whole point.Resident Evil got my vote not because the zombies were scary, but because it had some good shocks and nice action. The Ring is a very different type of movie, closer to horror than action.From the very first scene of the movie the eerie atmosphere is set very well. If you're actually watching the movie, it's near impossible not to get into the creepy mood. Even if you're just waiting for \"it\" to happen, whatever it may be. The movie makes it quite clear, it will happen, and you do not know what it is. It's a really refreshing take from recent films where the villian is obvious.I've heard numerous reports of people losing sleep over this movie and having trouble leaving it at the theater. I can't say I found it frightening to that level, but it still managed to send a good chill down my spine throughout the film and startle me a number of times. I was shaking a bit coming out of the theater, I'm hoping it's because it was rather cold. ^_^;The horror is broken up from time to time with interesting and entertaining exploration and story development. However, just when you think the movie is switching from a horror flick to an interesting mystery flick, the horror elements return, in force.Although parts of the movie are somewhat corny, and many reports of the movie are of course over hyped, you will indeed at least be creeped out and entertained throughout. It's certainly worth seeing, and I'd recommend seeing it with a friend. You'll have a hard time not giving away the details if you don't.And if you like to bring a gullible, easily scared girl to the movies with you, don't be surprised if you end up jumping a few times yourself. ^_^ Don't worry, your friends who have seen it as well won't laugh at you... too much.Rirath_com'\n",

You feel like you're about to be rewarded for the two hours you spend, and end up with a predictable finale that leaves you with even more questions.  The film is lazy.

            "Review: 'My only advice to anyone going to see The Ring is NOT to see the original in advance. It sort of spoiled my enjoyment of this as I was constantly comparing it, in my head, to Hideo Nakata's version.That said, The Ring is still a very interesting story and manages effectively to create a tense atmosphere- maybe not as tense as Nakata's, but certainly one of the most chilling US horror movies in recent years.Gore Verbinski's take on the original Koji Suzuki novelette 'Ringu' is interesting in its own right- this is not a shot-for-shot remake (like Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake) and it was enjoyable to get another angle on the story. The opening scene, for example, is more subtle in the original, but I like what Verbinski did with it: he extended the scene a bit and ended it very well, I believe. The revelation near the end, delivered by Aidan was also a nice addition that didn't appear in the original.While a bit heavy-handed (showing us a scene in the present then showing us the corresponding scene on the tape) I think Gore Verbinski's effort was quite good.However (comparing it to the original) there were a few things I didn't like during the film (besides it stopping halfway through, the lights coming on and that awful, awful Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi starting to play!). They are as follows [MAJOR SPOILERS]: I didn't like Samara in this one- they shouldn't have shown the face and made us sympathise with her- Sadako was much creepier. And what the hell was with A) Rachel coughing up that long piece of lace and B) the scene with the horse running amok on the ferry? (it was good from a supernatural point of view, but it was bizarre!) Still though, the TV scene was very, very good and the well being under the cabin was a nice twist.The Ring is definitely worth seeing- it delivers some good shock moments with an underlying tension throughout. Perhaps not as unnerving as Nakata's, but a good horror film in its own right.(BTW: I didn't like that they tried to tie in the title with the film. The ring in the original (to the best of my knowledge) referred to the video tape getting passed from person to person not a ring of light like in this one. So I thought that was a bit stupid.)'\n",

            "Review: 'If you watch the tape, seven days later, you die.  That's the tagline for one of the creepiest, most effective horror thrillers to hit the screens in years.'The Ring' is a remake of a Japanese film and novel, ably directed this time around by Gore Verbinski (best known for 'The Mexican').  It stars Naomi Watts as Rachel Keller, a journalist whose niece dies under mysterious circumstances exactly one week after having watched that cursed tape.  After tracking down a copy of the tape and seeing for herself what's there, Rachel finds herself drawn into a maze of mystery and intrigue mixed with the paranormal, working against the clock.  If the stories are true - she only has seven days to unlock the secrets of the tape.The key to this film lies in the visuals.  Obviously, in using a VHS tape to show this ghostly curse, it's important to have a strange, creepy look to the tape - it holds all the visual clues for the story to follow, as well as setting up the theme and mood for the entire picture.  Everything on the tape is grainy, black-and-white, and silent.  There is a definite foreboding to the whole thing, even though, as one character says, it looks like an art-school project.  Visuals are also important in the rest of the filming - most of the action takes place in gloomy, dark, and remote locales.  It's the Seattle area, so it's almost always raining.  Most interiors are gray and stark.  A rundown cabin in the woods.  A lighthouse and farm on a cold, barren island.  From the initial scenes, which are more vibrant and colorful, to the end sequences, things in Rachel's life are veering her closer to the secrets in the tape and the terrible answers she's looking to find.  Visually, the film grows darker and grimmer as the seventh day approaches. \n",
            "Watts handles this with a mixture of tension and unavoidable curiosity as Rachel's psyche is assaulted by tragedy and fear.  A lesser actress might fall into the usual scream queen traps - all stumbling and screaming - but Watts is better than that.  She shows fear, yes, but also resolve and a good sense of intelligence even as she draws closer to the end.  This is certainly her movie - she's the focus around which everything unfurls, and she holds her end together quite well.  'The Ring' is a ghost story, and a very tightly-plotted one at that. Everything in the tape is a clue to the mystery, and as it unfolds, more and more layers are evident.  The film does its audience the credit of not completely spelling out each and every detail, or walking through every step of the plot.  It reveals enough to bring gasps and shivers and even scares when it has to, and never resorts to manipulating the facts and motivations to achieve a cheap surprise.  There are twists, but there are seeds for those twists that fester in the background until they're needed - providing great chills along the way.This is a well-designed, well-executed thriller that has scares to spare, and a chilling backstory that will leave the audience in shivers even after the film is over.  Top-notch psychological horror here.'\n",

Well, I for one didn't.As the storyline develops the whole videotape business goes down the trash and the movie slowly turns into a \"What lies beneath\" or \"The sixth sense\" kind of film. I didn't like that one bit. By the end of the movie, and specially in the last sequence, you have to remind yourself \"Oh yeah, the tape! That's what this was all about!\". In short, the movie weakens itself progressively and finally collapses, just to have a little spark of life in that \"last confrontation\" scene. Still, the very ending, in my humble opinion, is nothing short of dumb. And Naomi Watts' performance doesn't help the story much either. It's just not convincing.I think the movie is worth watching for two main reasons:The videotape itself gives you goose bumps. As they say in the movie, it's something you'd only see in a nightmare. - The \"last confrontation\" I mentioned earlier contain some of the scariest images you'll see in any movie. The director chose many of those shots so that they would look like an individual point of view, and that has a big impact when you're alone in your room watching TV. But then again, most of this new wave of thriller movie directors do the same.Aside from this two sequences the movie does not contribute anything to the genre. Recent movies like \"The sixth sense\", \"The others\" or \"Signs\" have a much bigger impact on the audience using only the atmosphere built throughout the film and a few carefully selected shots and sounds; they don't rely in visual FX: just good directors and good performances.

All of the elements were there:  the bad acting, lame lines, and the cheesiness of the scene with the two girls just made me cringe.  Within minutes this movie rapidly showed its true nature.  DO NOT BE FOOLED! This movie is all bite and no bark.  Yes, it is formulaic and the acting is sub-par, but that does not mean this is not going to scare you witless.  Let me put it to you this way, when they show the tape for the first time, YOU WILL BE SCARED.  Even knowing that this would be the breaking point of the film, I was not ready for the tape.  The images on the tape are the essence of good horror: reality gone horribly wrong.  It has all the artistry of indie films and gothic horror the likes of which Poe and Lovecraft would be proud of.  The rest of the movie is just window dressing, but there is nothing wrong with that.  This movie shows us how the formula is supposed to work, and that is something worth seeing.'\n",

            "Review: 'I don't scare easily. Usually, movies that are supposed to be scary just roll off my back. That's not to say that I don't love a good horror film; I'm susceptible to a few shudders in a good horror movie, but generally I can watch one and be able to sleep at night afterward.Not so \"The Ring\". This movie scared the s*** out of me. I can't put it any less crudely than that; something about it just resonated with me more than with other horror movies. \"The Ring\" was the scariest movie I've seen in a very long time; not even classics like \"Halloween\" or \"Psycho\" approach this level of terror.I confess I've never seen the original Japanese film on which that was based, so I'm not in a position to compare the two; and I feel that it would be unfair to do so anyway. \"The Ring\" stands alone as a great movie just as a movie based on a book can stand alone as a great movie, and that's what's important. The cast is top-notch; Naomi Watts, as Rachel, gives the best performance I've ever seen her give. It's a career-defining moment. Brian Cox also stands out as the long-suffering father of the little girl, Samara, who as played by Daveigh Chase may be the most chilling movie villain of all time. That she could do such a terrible thing and feel no remorse at all, being a little girl, it's just scary because it's so unexpected. The climax, where we see her crawl out of the TV to kill Noah (Martin Henderson, who along with David Dorfman as Rachel's son Aidan is credible and believable in his role) is just the scariest thing I think I've ever seen. I remember when I was little, watching \"Carrie\", with this girl moving things with her mind, trapping all these people in a gym and killing them with an unholy bloodbath, being scared by that. I was not as scared by that when I was 10 as I was by the climax of \"The Ring\" at 27. I still get chills thinking of that scene, and that little girl.The idea of being killed 7 days after watching a videotape didn't seem that scary to me, and I confess that when it was in theaters I had written it off as just another dumb teen horror movie along the lines of \"Urban Legends\" or \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". Obviously I was way off, and I'm glad I gave into all the people who told me I had to watch it. I'm not sure if I can actually say that \"The Ring\" is the scariest movie of all time, but it's definitely close.'\n",

            "Review: 'I haven't seen the original film 'Ringu' from which this movie was based but I would have to say that Hollywood did an OK job on this film.  The plot is not Hollywood's, thank heavens, because in recent years any horror movie with any plot coming out of Hollywood seems to need to conform to the Scooby Doo format.  By that I mean by the end every little mystery has been explained in full detail.... unfortunately at the expense of the real ingredients, fear, suspense, etc, etc.The idea of this film is very clever, if you didn't know anything about it then you would be surprised at what is going on and you would not be able to predict the ending even if you were convinced you had it right, you'd be wrong.  Having read reviews to other Japanese horror movies it seems that many of them have intelligent and curious causes to the supernatural phenomenon as well.  An influx of American remakes may follow The Ring.To give some sort of review I would have to say that it is for the most part one of the very best horror movies of the last 5 years.  There is a deep and disturbing atmosphere, although I will see Ringu next and compare to see if it comes close.  There is an excellent score of music to set the mood and tone of what the director wants you to feel during the scenes and the sound effects are used well to develop the tension.  The storyline itself is by far the movie's strongest point and compares with any horror I can think of.In short I would definately say watch this movie if you like supernatural horrors, or maybe you should see the original 'Ringu' first though??'\n",

            "Review: 'The film about the mysterious videotape that kills you one week after you watch it. The story centres on journalist Rachel Keller (played by the beautiful Naomi Watts) who, having seen the tape, has one week to solve its riddle or become its latest victim.Personally, I found this the scariest movie I have seen. I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre (not matter what anybody tells you, this IS a horror film) but I've seen most of the standards and can appreciate a good scary film. The whole atmosphere is downright chilling, and the scenes with Samara in the mental hospital are particularly disturbing. Great credit must go to young Daveigh Chase for her performance. Indeed, the character of Samara must rank as one of the scariest cinematic creations ever. She makes the film and the scenes involving her are the scary ones. And I mean SCARY. Her image will linger with you for long after the film has ended and you will never look at a television the same way again.There are arguments and counter-arguments for whether this is superior to the Japanese original. I want to add my two cents and I'll say this: whichever version you see first will probably be the one you will champion. On repeat viewing the film does lose some of its impact because you know what to expect. You know how the tape kills people and the shock will be gone. Therefore, if you see this after the Japanese version it will seem inferior, and vice versa. That said, its still a very effective horror film and, in my opinion, far superior to anything Hollywood has produced in this genre for a long time. Well worth a look, but I wouldn't advise watching alone because if someone hasn't already told you what happens, it will scare the hell out of you. I gave 8 out of 10.'\n",

            "Review: 'This is one of those movies that really could have been among the greats in the genre like The Exorcist. The Ring establishes one of the best horror atmospheres that I have ever experienced and it even delivers on the scares that it promises. But, aside from all that is everything that is unforgivable. The entire movie just grows more and more absurd; thought I cannot give any specific examples without making this review a big spoiler, the movie either fails to explain the origins and purpose of the tape and all the mystery surrounding it or gives an explanation that is something more than absurd. Still, I concede that atmosphere is probably the most effective element in a horror movie and The Ring succeeds beyond my wildest dreams on that level. There are no showy special effects, but instead subtle little touches like an eerie cabin near a misty and spooky forest, a quiet farming town with an aura of uneasy silence surrounding it, and most importantly, a woman who changes from an everyday news reporter to a tense and fearful person afraid for the lives of everyone she loves.Still, one of the biggest gripes I had with this movie was the videotape itself. There are a lot of people who seem to think that it was creative and extremely frightening; I am not one of those people. Whoever was responsible for the creation of the videotape footage seemed to create a montage by just throwing together a bunch of individually interesting images that had little effect, especially in the long run. When we see some of the objects on the tape in real life, The Ring wants us to say \"wow,\" instead we are left muttering anything but flattery. The tape is the central piece of the movie, something that the audience yearns to see and be frightened by. To me the piecing together of \"artsy\" images has become a cliché and an all too easy way out.Another big problem is the ending, or rather, the lack of a good one. There are a few points before the actual end that I thought the movie should have ended; granted that any of the other ending points would have been more typical, any other ending would have stopped the continual onslaught of brainless explanations and commercially injected meaning. There is one point where Watts says, \"I want to go home,\" where I definitely would have liked to see the movie end. Yes we've seen it before and yes it's the easy way out that I was complaining the tape footage took, but not everything can be original and not everything has to be original. Horror movies and thrillers these days are still all trying to duplicate the huge plot twist of The Sixth Sense, and the eventual monetary success that the film enjoyed. At some point there has to be a concession that Shyamalan's picture was beyond what almost all people in Hollywood are capable of in terms of its shock value.Luckily, making up for the script's flaws is the talent involved in the cast, especially in Naomi Watts. Her performance as Rachael is often the saving grace of this movie. She transforms otherwise painful moments into something emotionally compelling or frightening. At first look, Watts is the typical attractive female that all horror movies like to showcase either in the main character or in one of the side characters. But she transcends the typical female in a horror movie role and shows us her character's depth and emotions. She starts out as reporter investigating her niece's death to a woman with seven days to live and a son and ex-husband with only a day or so more than her.In the end The Ring is similar to one of this weekend's other releases, Abandon. Both show us some elements of brilliance that are rare in movies of their type, both are bad movies in the end. The Ring is a movie that could have offered more than a few scares and a cool look, but alas, the writer failed to write with logic and reason as is often the case in Hollywood.'\n",

            "Review: 'Even in 2023, the movie looks decent. Also, after watching the original 1998 film, you may notice a deeper level of detail. The shift in focus on the sensory abilities of children rather than adults. Adults try to analyze every action and event, unlike children who simply don't have that experience. Therefore, the overall picture of children's naivety and lack of deep analysis and consequences of an event becomes frightening for adults.In this respect, the 2002 movie is more atmospheric in terms of conveying the emotion and stimulus of fear through the children's sensorics. But the detective line is also retained, as exciting as in the original movie.The balance of depressing atmosphere, detective, and fear of the transience of time makes the movie still relevant today, and rightfully shows the horror genre, even without the screemers.'\n",

Personally, I did not find this movie scary, even the infamous \"walking out of the TV\" part. It follows a woman who is trying to uncover the mystery of a mysterious videotape and why people die 7 days until they die. Naomi Watts is that woman and she is a journalist and very good at uncovering the mystery, while both she and her son must race against time because they have both received the mysterious phone call saying they had seven days. This is a movie that does not follow the conventional, commercial means of getting a cheap scare, and it is above average with its intelligence. The answers to all of the mystery are very interesting, but sometimes this movie borders on silliness. It was remade from the Japanese movie Ringu, which is much more praised and also much more scary. Both of these movie use the use of technology as means of fright: videotapes, telephone calls, etc. This is an enjoyable movie, but not very scary.My grade: 7/10'\n",

That girl put me under the blanket many times. And that happened when I wasn't watching the movie. I saw the movie 9 times and I know it like I know my pockets. I am very found of horror movies and then, in 2002, there wasn't any good horror movie on the market. I hate monster horror movies like vampire movies or other mystical creature movie. I heard of The Ring and I said: \"Lets see what they can do now!\". I took 2 friends and started the movie. From the first scene, there is not one minute when you can rest and not being in constant fear that something bad will happen, and that's great. That's how a horror movie should be. Naomi Watts is excellent (actress and woman), she gives you the filling that she's doing this to save you, because you saw the tape to and in the same time as she. David Dorfman...made my eyes leak when he said \"mummy, she never sleeps!\"; so an A+ for David. Brian Cox brings the mystery surrounding Samara. Daveigh Chase (my favorite U15 actress) makes this a very spooky movie. Whenever she appears the screen, my skin goes crazy. She's so spooky and scary that no one can stay undistracted. All the actors are excellent even if I don't mention them because this is a comment and not the story of the movie.Oh, I almost forgot about Mr. Gore Verbinski. He is one of the best directors in Hollywood. Thankyou very much Mr. Verbinski for what you've done with an overused Japanese myth.Thankyou DreamWorks! Keep it up!'\n",

Too much time is devoted to the investigation into the origins of video. This leads to resolution of sorts at the end, but creates too many dead end sub-plots and plot holes in the process. Overall the suspense just wasn't there. The freakiest moments of the film are delivered at the end, but by then I was left feeling cheated that at 116 minutes running time I had only seen 10 minutes that were remotely scary. The DVD edition contains an imaginative presentation of what appears to be deleted and alternate scenes from the movie. To me, it was more enjoyable than the actual movie. All in all, I found that The Ring failed to deliver on it's promises. Maybe it's just because of all the hype... 4/10* A fun little prank to play if you are watching this movie with other people: If you have a cell phone, near the end of the movie discreetly cue up the phone number of the place you are watching the movie at without removing the phone from your pocket. When the credits are rolling, call the number (again, without removing the phone from your pocket). This should elicit a bit of fear, especially in younger viewers. Heh heh heh.'\n",

Gore verbinski does a great job of giving the audience a little of everything you could want from a scary/horror movie; dark, dank settings, creepy kids, a gloomy storyline, plenty of \"jump\" moments, and an overall plot that keeps you guessing. The characters do a good job not overacting, which is so often the norm in movies like this, and Naomi Watts is an absolute treat to watch on the screen not only because of her absolutely breathtaking beauty but also because of her obvious talent. There is no all looks and no talent, or as I like to call it Julia Roberts syndrom here. The girl can act. So if you are looking for a recommendation it is simple; GO AND SEE IT!!!!! It will creep you out, at least a little bit, and around Halloween time, as we all parade around to haunted house after haunted house, isn't that what it is all about?But for those of you who did see it, doesn't the movie lose a bit by leaving so many questions unanswered? When I say questions I mean questions about plot holes which, after a night of thinking on it, there seem to be a plethera of. SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!First, why does it seem that the video tape is, on one hand a documented recording of Samara's memory, and at other times it appears it is fortelling the future for the characters? At one point, upon leaving a building, Watt's character walks under a ladder and remembers the ladder from the video. Fortelling the future. But why does the video do nothing of the sort for the rest of movie? Wouldn't it have been better if it were simply a recorded memory?Second, why is the father still alive? He obviously knows of the tape, has even seen it, knows what it can do, knows what his daughter does through the tape, and we know that Samara hated her father. So why does he live until he takes his own life? Why not go after him? Why not kill him?Third, this is less of a plot hole then just an absolutely assinine thing, but why, when she goes up to the horse and it freaks out does she continue to stay near it/try and calm it down? Wouldn't you get the sense after, I don't know, the second full body convulsion the horse has that maybe you are not a horse person? Maybe you would walk away at that point but Watt's character keeps going as if some magic combination of \"Shhsh\" and \"calm down boy\" would put the horse into a deep sleep. Yes, we get it, the horses hated Samara because she hated them and killed them so they can sense her presence. We don't need a completely insane moment to prove it.Fourth, why wouldn't Watts have picked up on the fact that the doctor asks Samara on the tape if she still wants to hurt people? How could she just gloss over that? It was pretty clear, doctor on the other side of a glass sheet, first bad indicator right there, asking a very creepy looking girl whether she wanted to hurt her mother anymore and very creepy girl answering no but she can't help it. Boy, not something I would soon forget. You would think that would have been a clue that the girl was just a bit off and that maybe it wasn't just about a mean old man making her live in a barn all the time.Fifth, why does the father hit her? He doesn't try and kill her, she isn't taking evidence that could lead to some sort of harmful event for him, and she recovers pretty easily from it just to watch him kill himself. Why hit her? He was just pissed she used the VCR without asking? He decided it was either that or put off killing himself and heat up some coffee? Doesn't make much sense.Sixth, if the kid, who gets all huffy when he finds out his parents helped out the girl, knew that Samara was evil and should not be helped or aided in any way, why not tell his mom? Why does he just sit back, draw some horrible painting, the kid has no talent, and make it seem as if the girl is a nice little ghost who comes to visit him? Why not have the \" oh by the way, that girl that comes to me and shows me things, you know the girl who said she is gonna kill you, well she is pretty damn evil so be careful and for Goidsakes don't help her\" conversation? That never crossed the kids mind?Seventh, what is the point of finding out, so late in the game, that the guy, the random VCR geek guy, is in fact the father of the kid? Why are we told this in the middle of the movie? Why is this information so shocking that it requires a sudden, poignant moment of it's own in the MIDDLE of the movie? Does anyone really believe that people would have left thinking \"Boy that was good, but I really wish they would have saved who the kids father was until right in the middle of the flick. That would have made it an Oscar contender.\"Finally, what the hell good does it do the creepy evil girl to have been released from her well? Instead of killing people through the TV she now comes out of the TV and kills people. Wow, big freakin Wow. She still has to wait I guess, she still has to go through the tape, and she still, I assume, has to wait 7 days or she would have killed the guy that same day as when she was released. And in the end Watts and the kid beat the system by making copies and showing it to people. So thats all you have to do I guess, make a copy and sho it to someone else and your off. So why is thise so damn bad? Tell that person to make a copy, the next person the same, and on and on and on until poor little creepy evil girl can't kill anyone cause their all making copies. Of course she would have a huge comeback when VCR's are all replaced by DVDs and no one can make a copy anymore, but until then she is kinda up the creek. And this after doing so much to get herself freed from the well, she still has to live/kill by the same rules. Kinda kills the whole plot at the end, doesn't it.But funny thing is I still recommend this movie. Go see it and don't think till you get out of the theatre.

Each frame/scene ends leaving you thinking that something will happen.I had to turn away couple times so I wouldn't have to look at the faces of the girl who dies in the start and Naomi's husband who dies in the end. Not that I was scared, but I don't believe looking at those gruesome images is any good, mentally. A true horror classic with no gore, no nudity, no cursing and other B grade horror movie stuff. I would rate this and \"The Others\" as the best ones I've ever seen. I live alone in a studio apartment, but I wasn't scared or anything. It's simply a matter of what you want to believe.'\n",

It;s one of the most suspenseful movies I have seen in my life, apart from The Grudge (2004) this keeps you hanging to the very last minute of the movie.Rachel, a young woman reporting for the P.I. finds out about a suspicious Video tape that kills you when you watch it, since the last victim of the tape was her niece Katie.The mother of Katie asks Racheal to find out more about the tape and what happened to Katie, so she goes to the place where Katie watched the tape. Shelter Mountain Inn. But it seems that the rumors at Revere High are true. As Rachel is horror struck after watching the tape when she found it at shelter Mountain Inn, the phone mysteriously rings.......Coninsidense right? But no, the one on the phone was none other than Samara, the evil girl on the tape.Is this the end of Racheals life? Can she unlock the secrets of the tape and stop it from killing her, and can she send Samara back to peace? Only she can find out, no one else can....Basic summary of The Ring, but the plot is much better than how I have explained it, but beware.... Be ready for anything!'\n",

It's a good date movie if you like scaring the heck out of your date.  It's also a pretty good movie.I have a hard time giving this film better than 7 out of 10, but it's the case.  However, many more films that receive such a rating deserve less. This film is 70% satisfying as a film.  As a scary movie, it's a whopping 100% satisfaction rating.  So, that's good.Naomi Watts is too pretty for this movie.  So is her ex-boyfriend.  And her son's role is embarassingly similar to the kid in the Sixth Sense.  All those problems are still not enough to not be completely terrified by the premise of this film.  Watch the videotape and in seven days you DIE!Cheesy, sure, but scary anyway.  And all scary movies have an inherent cheesiness, no matter how classy they feign to be.  So this is the best kind of cheese.  This film is really scary.  By the way, did I say it was scary?

But even so, the trailer (which I viewed nonstop on the Internet) was ... breathtaking. It reassured me that a good and well made scary movie was finally going to come around.It's definitely well made. The movie looks absolutely amazing. The music is perfect, really makes you feel like impending doom is about to be unleashed.But the film did a horrible job in explaining the plot.. I had a talk with some of my friends after the movie, and it took us about an hour to fully get it.Other bad things: the dialogue is pretty weak, and we have another cliched boy wonder (David Dorfman) who has big, big eyes and is in tradition of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. He knows lots and people confide in his words. Ugh.Nonetheless, the film works on some levels, mainly the ones I stated before. The video itself is pretty damn creepy, in grand tradition of the Nine Inch Nails \"Closer\" video (with chairs spinning really fast upside down and all, etc). And the cinematography gives it loads of atmosphere.So if you're expecting a scary good time, by all means come and watch this film.

            "Review: 'I see that some people have been really hard on this film because there was apparently a lot of hype about it. Well, I rented it on DVD expecting it to be an average post-Scream horror movie that would be entertaining in a mindless sort of way. Not having a clue that it was a remake probably helped. Anyway, I was completely wrong.   Say what you want about the story or the plot or whatever, but this movie could make it on visuals alone, in my opinion. Whoever put this together seems to have a very good understanding of what sort of images will cause a knot to rise up in your chest and hot chills to run down your spine, and in that respect, The Ring works beautifully. I'm still getting chills and I watched it over an hour ago. It's likely to stay with me for days. I'm not someone who scares easily, and I've experienced a lot of horror movies, including Italian greats like Suspiria. Few films have affected me the way this one has. The Exorcist is really the only one I can think of right now.   I think a lot of people try to intellectualize horror films way too much. The main reason horror films are made is to play on that instinctual, gut-level reaction we have to the abnormal and the unnatural. For the most part, true horror doesn't really try to stimulate your intellect. It's goal is to reduce you to a quivering puddle of human jelly who's scared to get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. If the movie succeeds at that, then you can always use your imagination to fill in whatever gaps you notice when your heart calms down and you're able to think rationally. That's how I like to look at it, anyway. I don't WANT to have a film about the supernatural explain every little detail to me. It takes all the fun out of it. Kills the mystery.   Anyway, if you're here, at this point you know what the movie is about, so I won't describe the plot here. I'll just list some of the things that scared me the most. POSSIBLE SPOILERS - SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!   The image that is most haunting to me right now is the little girl's hair moving up out of the well, seemingly of it's own will, before she climbs out. It's almost as gut-wrenching as the famous head-spinning scene in The Exorcist. Just completely unnatural. Something inside you just screams, \"That's not supposed to be happening, make it stop!\" I am trying not to freak out right now as I'm remembering it. I don't think I'll be getting much sleep tonight. The girl's slow lurching towards the television screen as you're hoping the guy will have the good sense to grab a chair and smash the screen before she gets there. The final glimpse at the girl's water-logged, bloated face after she comes out of the screen. The distorted and collapsed faces of her victims is also terribly disturbing. The video of her in the hospital, just sitting silently with her hair obscuring her face, or pacing her cell, never sleeping. Her lonely little loft in the barn. The look on the little boy's face when he asks his mother why she helped the girl get out of the dark place after you thought it was all going to end happily is also quite a blow. The blurred faces of future victims in photographs is effectively creepy. This stuff alone is worth the price of the DVD.   The entire movie is just that, creepy. The beautiful scenery of the gloomy countryside, the stark black and white video and the flashbacks as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the music...it all just gives you a tense, uneasy feeling as you wait for the next haunting image to pop out at you, one that may be so frightening that you can't bear to watch anymore. And that always makes a more intriguing horror film, to me at least, than those films that try to make you jump with loud noises and false scares, and if that doesn't work, outright gross-out. This movie does have a few moments that make you go \"What are they thinking?\", but that's to be expected. All-in-all, I think this film is a work of art in it's own right, and I recommend it to everyone. It is definitely one of the best horror films to come out of Hollywood in a while.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'll leave the symbolic analyses of this film to more lettered critics of cinema, and get to the meat of the matter: this film, for all its' Hollywoodized flaws is still miles ahead of anything else in the pack so far this year. Director Verbinski had the wit to adapt as much as he could from the original Japanese version, \"Ringu\", thereby letting the sheer momentum of the story's corner-of-your-eye horrors herd the viewer into an inescapable nightmare. It accomplishes the neat trick of (mostly) sidestepping all of our \"here-it-comes\" expectations and coming out of left field to deliver something even more horrible. It reminded me of Stephen King's comment twenty years ago, when he said that he thinks books are better at conveying horror than movies because with books you can get the audience alone, one at a time. \"The Ring\" came closer for me than most other American films(exceptions being the 1963 version of \"The Haunting\" and \"Wait Until Dark\") at doing just that. When I saw it recently in a packed theater, the audience laughed nervously every time the expected scare made them jump; about two-thirds of the way in, nobody was laughing, and we were all pulling for Naomi Watts' heroine to solve this horrifying riddle of the fatal video tape and save herself and her loved ones. It really conjured up a modern-day horror to address modern alienation, and its attendant ills. By the way, in addressing another reviewer's canard on this site: yes, Verbinski's insistance on using overly loud \"whooomph!\" sound effects was fairly annoying, but that failed to kill the mood this film conjured up for me and millions of others. If you want a REALLY annoying example of intrusive music and \"BOOGA-BOOGA!\" foley effects, catch \"Ghost Story\". I saw that turkey when it came out in '81, and it was all I could do not to throw my large-size Coke Classic at the screen. A small editorial note: any and all critics who didn't find this film even a little spooky obviously suffer the \"auteur disease\": if it's made in America,it's automatically crap; if it's made in France, they'll kiss it's ass no matter how bad it is.

However, the main characters are SO selfish and obnoxious, and the supporting cast SO clearly cardboard copies of 1,000 better characters in scarier films, that this film ultimately is just frustrating and kind of lame. At best it's a decent mystery, but c'mon, is this REALLY as scary as people are saying, or did the quick cutting just make you jump a bunch?

The writer thinks so low of the audience that this chick can treat her child like crap the whole time, but if she keeps saying \"I'm doing this for Haley Joel #2\" then we're all supposed to go \"Holy crap!

Ohhhhhhhhhhh. I'm shuddering just thinking about her looking through old newspaper articles and saying \"What did you do to yourself, Ruth?\" just like EVERY character in these hackneyed plots has to say when their in the basement looking though old newspaper articles. This had such potential, and is just kinda gay at best. Try a little harder! C'mon, it's not THAT hard to be scary.

The film's slow pacing in the first half can test the patience of some viewers, and the plot, while intriguing, has its share of implausible moments and unanswered questions.On the positive side, Naomi Watts delivers a solid performance as the determined investigative journalist, and the overall sense of dread and impending doom is effectively conveyed. The concept of a malevolent spirit coming to life through technology was innovative at the time and added a fresh twist to the genre.However, as the story unfolds, it may become increasingly convoluted and, to some extent, reliant on jump scares. Additionally, the scares can feel somewhat dated compared to contemporary horror standards.In conclusion, \"The Ring\" is a significant film in the horror genre and has left a mark on popular culture. While it has its merits, including a haunting atmosphere and a unique premise, it may not fully satisfy modern horror aficionados who are accustomed to faster pacing and more refined scares.'\n",

            "Review: 'Yeah.Kinda moody here and there, kinda liked the kid coming up out the well, liked the way she came out the TV. Nearly worked. Liked the flickery look of her, like she was made of TV. That was kinda cool.Liked the horse on the ferry, nearly worked with those worrying cellos thumping away a la \"Jaws\".But, um, its got that problem that movies have now, where everything's in the Modern Style, desaturated images, tastefully composed shots of grime and electric cables looking more like a still life in an art gallery than a scene from a movie, blurry shots of eeeevil Samara in the asylum, BEAUTIFULLY composed and tinted, making me think \"oooh how tasteful and elegant\" not \"cripes, what a creepy little girl\". My poor brain won't do \"arrg scary\" at the same time as it's doing \"oooo tasteful\". During that bit where they find her room in the barn with the cute little TV like something out of a spooooooky sort of Calvin and Hobbes strip (it had cutely angled little ariels like a friendly grasshopper) and the little carousel and her little bed all uniformly tinted in pale browns and faded sour creams I thought, how EVOCATIVE. How MYSTERIOUS. And how thoroughly FAKE LOOKING. Such a perfect, sweet little theatre set - it would have been beautiful on a stage but in the movie it just looks like something that would have been beautiful on a stage.If you over-stylise these things, they stop being scary and just become static, like images in a gallery. They're lovely to look at, but why not just make images and put them in a gallery? They'd work better and probably actually be scarier. It's fine to overdo the interior deco in a fantasy film or a comedy or a sci fi flick, but not a horror movie, horror movies have to be real, nail-scrapingy, eye-bulgingly real. Reality isn't tasteful or well-composed. Or cunningly tinted to look older than it is.Having said all that, the girl coming out the TV nearly worked, because it's supposed to be supernatural.Guys, horror movies have rules.Also, no, no, no, filmmakers, don't add pointless subplots about parents trying to reunite for the sake of their kid. It's a horror movie, not a chick flick.3 stars, all 3 for Samara coming out the well, which, had I been significantly younger and had seen fewer horror movies, would probably have been quite scary.'\n",

CREEEEPYYYYYY!!!!I've been watching movies filed under \"Horror\" since I was about 8 years old and I'm in my early 30's right now.  There are very few \"Scary Movies\" I've found to be genuinely scary and able to make one feel uneasy: \"The Exorcist\"(especially if you have your VCR hooked up to your stereo), \"The Shining\" (again, the sound among many other things), \"Hallowe'en\" (mainly the music), David Cronenberg's version of \"The Fly\" (for his audacity to put in everything he DID put in), ... And now, THIS MOVIE.Okay, there are a whole bunch of things that can be found wrong with this movie; a lot of it seems like you're watching This Movie meets That Movie meets Another, and so on.  But originality (or lack thereof) aside, THIS MOVIE SCARES.Oddly, there are movies I find scary that don't get filed under Horror, even though they do scare.  For example, there were quite a few times during the first half-hour of \"Saving Private Ryan\", I had to keep reminding myself that I was not in danger of getting drilled into Swiss Cheese or being blown up, I was sitting at home in my Living Room watching the most unsettling battle scene I'd ever seen on ANY screen.  I'm not saying \"Saving Private Ryan\" should be filed under Horror; I'm just giving an example of the difference between a Movie that Scares and a Scary Movie.The Ring is BOTH of these.  To the folks who made it, both behind the camera and in front, TAKE A BOW.That's a wrap.'\n",

            "Review: 'Based on the Japanese film \"Ringu\", which is based on the novel by Koji Suzuki, \"The Ring\" follows a woman named Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the mysterious death of her niece, in the process discovering a videotape that kills all who watch it in seven days. The final twist is not one of your typical Hollywood clichés, but thats only because Hollywood clichés do not negate the entire film, which is what the ending does. There have been so many movies with a little boy who looks and acts similar to Rachel's son Aidan (David Dorfman), that watching all the scenes with Aidan are difficult because you feel like you know exactly what he is going to say and do. The visuals are excellent, but that doesn't make up for the mediocre acting and direction and the terrible ending. When compared to recent horror films, \"The Ring\" really is not that bad. Just about every horror movie within the last decade or so has been terrible, except for \"28 Days Later\" and \"Dawn of the Dead\", and \"The Ring\" is without a doubt better than something like \"Freddy vs. Jason\" or \"Alien vs. Predator\". All the previews said that this was one of the greatest horror films ever, and everyone who saw this said it was so scary, so I expected to be scared. There is nothing in the film that makes you jump out of your seat, which is obviously what most people look for in horror movies. While \"The Ring\" is probably one of the ten best horror films of a 21st century in which good horror films have been almost impossible to find, there is no way that this film could rank among the truly great horror films of all time.'\n",

            "Review: 'The Ring is a horror movie about a video that kills people. If you watch it, you will experience hallucinations for seven days, and then die mysteriously. The movie's protagonist, a single mother named Rachel, watches the movie in the hopes of finding out what caused the death of her niece; but Rachel soon realizes that she is going to be the movie's next victim.In The Ring, we find that the video was created by a girl named Samara, an adopted child whose origins are never explained, much like Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. But, while Bronte's novel shows Heathcliff's demented psyche to be the result of much harsh treatment at the hands of his adopted family, this movie shows precisely no explanation for how Samara came to be the satanic, sadistic child that the movie reveals her to be. She was adopted by a couple who wanted a child. Was this girl the creation of witches, or goblins, or Satan himself? There are hints that she is an aberration upon nature itself: her presence causes horses to go mad and pitch themselves into the ocean. Similarly, in Macbeth, the title character causes nature to go awry because, by murdering the king and taking his place, he has interrupted the great chain of being. But Samara, as far as we know, has committed no act that violates nature. She simply is a violation of nature, was born a violation of nature. Either that, or her adopted parents were extremely cruel to her, but nowhere in the movie is there evidence of such cruelty.The movie is a fantasy – televisions turn on by themselves; people's images are distorted in photographs; a mysterious phone call informs Rachel, moments after she watches the movie, that she has \"seven days\" to live (couldn't she do *69 or something to determine the source of the call?). Yet it also does a remarkable job of imitating a detective story. One by one, the odd images of the videotape are all explained by what Rachel sees in her research. Unfortunately, her research never does more than lap the surface.How, for instance, did Samara create this videotape in the first place? How did she distribute it? Why does she attack people whom she does not even know? The ready answer is, \"She is evil, it is her duty to do evil deeds.\" Rachel's ex-boyfriend Noah remarks, upon examining the videotape, that it does not read like a normal tape and that its lack of a proper imprint is like a person being \"born without fingerprints.\" That captures Samara to a T: she has no fingerprints. She came from nowhere, she returned to the nowhere, and she insists on dragging people with her retroactively.Samara has no remarkable effect upon anyone's personality. She has nothing to say about the real world, or how people ought to live their lives. For all practical purposes Samara is not a person at all, but simply a monster whose form happens to be that of young girl. Rachel knows she will not bring her niece back from the dead; she watches the videotape out of curiosity, and love for her niece. Five minutes after she has watched the tape, the niece is as good as forgotten, because Rachel must protect her own life. She investigates for the sake of survival, and because the story behind the tape is, I must admit, moderately engaging and it arouses her curiosity. But we watch because the evil of Samara terrifies us. Ignorance has always been the chief source of fear: the less comprehensible the object, the more powerful the fear it inspires.This focus on the concept of fear lends itself to the fact that the movie is, in the end, about a videotape. Most people in the world have little or no idea how a videotape actually works. You pop it in the VCR, and the movie starts; you neither know nor care what happens inside of the VCR. It is only the image on the television – the surface, not the depth – that matters. In our modern world of information technology, we are farther and farther distanced from the inner workings of the mechanisms that daily serve us. We want only the images, not the wires and sparks within. And so this movie asks the question, \"What happens when a videotape is possessed by a fantastical spirit? What kind of repairman do you call for that? He'd be just as confused as anyone else.\"The Ring contains no redemption, or morality; it is horror for the sake of horror. Needless to say it is not the first of its kind; but it is a half-hearted attempt to be something more. My problem with The Ring is not even that the movie raises questions and fails to answer them – the questions themselves are never formed or articulated. Throughout the movie there is a loosely visited theme of families staying together, but neither Samara's family nor Rachel's family obtains the unity it deserves. \"How can we live without any love?\" Rachel's son Aidan seems to ask of the audience. Aidan alone seems determined to coexist with Samara, to live within the bizarre parameters that she has set. They are parameters we can neither see nor chart, but they are there, and Samara has provided a way to survive if you can figure out the route.There is no \"ring\" in The Ring; the title refers to something different, although you might figure it out before I did. Relationships between people end unhappily in this movie, but the evil of the videotape runs uninterrupted. Samara is, somehow, the absolute, and when the movie finishes her hold on the world has not been weakened. And although Rachel solves the mystery of Samara's effect on her adopted parents, Samara's origins remain a mystery, and the filmmaker shows no interest in solving this other, deeper mystery.'\n",

            "Review: 'Worst film of 2002!! Poorly written, poorly acted & poorly directed.  Namoi Watts who showed promise as an actress in \"Mulholland Drive\" but she sure wasted her talents on this film.  I heard the film cost a reported $60 million to make. I sure would like to know where the $60 million went? Surely noton the screen or its plot more for the markting of this film. Another film that shows how a company like \"Dremworks\" is just in the movie business to make a fast buck and not out make a truly great film. I saw this at an advance screening and boy what a waste of my time. The first 1/2 hour I was interseted in the story, & I was caught up in the mystery of the VHS tape that killed people who watched it, the last hour an 1/2 the film got boring, slow-moving and muddled; characters came and went and gave half assed answers and the characters seemed to spill over from the \"Twin Peaks\" Tv show, and the ending was the biggest scam since \"The Blair Witch Project\". Not scary more like the \"The Changeling\" gone high-tech. I very silly movie with enough plot holes to sink a huge ship & a film by then end that doesn't make sense and leaves more questions than answers. Thank god I saw this for free since I would been really made if I had wasted $8.00 to see this over hyped and under done film. Skip it & wait for $0.50 cents day at your local dollar theater, or better yet wait for $0.99 cents day at your local video store when your really bored. Another film that should be considered for the Rasebery Award for Worst film of 2002!'\n",

            "Review: 'Initially, after seeing the vague previews for The Ring, I had no desire to see the movie.  After all, the trailers simply showed a random bunch of clips from the movie muddled together with various noises and movie dialogue instead of directly telling me what the movie was about.After the movie opened, however, I heard all of the buzz about the film and decided that it was worth a try.  What a treat this movie was.  It seems that finally Hollywood is getting the suspenseful movie down pat for this day and age.  After years of silly teen horror flicks that managed not to chill the spine but tickle the funny bone, the filmmakers of today are turning to older, more subtle methods of finding ways to scare its audiences.  Any classic filmmaker, such as Hitchcock, one of the masters of suspense, can tell you that less is more; you don't have to show a massive amount of blood and gore to induce fear.  All you have to do is create a thoughtful movie with an engaging plot that meanders its way through the movie, building on our fears until the ultimate climax.This is what The Ring aimed to do and succeeded greatly.  I went into this movie on pins and needles and was like that all the way through until the end.  The opening sequence grabbed at my attention through its mystery and imagery.  I like the fact that the movie shows you the tape when Rachel views it, the first chronological movie time that it is viewed, instead of making you wait until closer to the end.  I really liked how all of the elements of the tape are explained somewhere throughout the film, and a brief flashback of the tape is shown in order to remind you where you saw it first.  At first I was annoyed by the presence of a young boy in the film, seeing as it might be another clone of Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense, but David Dorfman is not overused; he is in the right number of scenes, and his importance is still felt.  Naomi Watts did a terrific job as the mother who learns her lesson about listening to her child the hard way. When Rachel and Noah found Samara's body in the well, I thought that this was the end of the movie, so the demise of Noah in a later scene gave me a satisfying jolt.  There are so many people that have been posting negative comments about this movie, saying that the ending is ambiguous and that there are plot holes in the movie.  Well, honestly think about it... do the best movies lay everything out on the table, completely clear-cut, that you understand it immediately?  Perhaps for some people, but for me... I like a good thinker. I like a movie that gets in your head and makes you think about it long after you've left the theater, movies that you argue with your friends about, that you debate the meanings of.  The Ring is one of these movies. Sure, there are questions that I have about this movie that I would love to have answered.  But I prefer to make up my own theories about them for now... at least until the sequel comes out (which hopefully will be just as good).  Isn't that half the fun of watching a movie?9/10'\n",

Even her most stringent critics cannot deny the brazen sexuality she radiated in last year's David Lynch freakfest, especially in the audition scene. And let's not forget those two memorable lesbian sex scenes, which Lynch was wise enough to make sensual instead of having his two actresses perform like endurance champions. Anyway, back to THE RING. Like last year's THE OTHERS, the film's emphasis is on suspense and creepy thrills rather than blood and gore. Some of the images are quite chilling and effective and remain with you long after the film has ended. The sound effects were expert as well, some of the best I've ever heard in a horror film. They establish the tone of the film and really do enhance the experience. My only quibble is that by the end, the mystery of the ring has not been cleared up in its entirety, and one cannot help but wonder if the filmmakers lacked the conviction to resolve the film in a satisfying manner. Anyway, for those who lack the attention span to try and unearth the mystery, there's always white-hot Aussie Naomi Watts in a wet T-shirt. Grade: 10/10'\n",

            "Review: 'As a fan of the original Japanese version of \"Ring\" (\"Ringu\") I am pleased to say that \"The Ring\" (starring the great Naomi Watts from the David Lynch masterpiece \"Mulholland Drive\") for the most part complements the original cycle of films and stands as one of the best American horror pictures of recent years.At first I thought the film had already blown it in the first scene. Hideo Nakata's original opens with a nod to horror movies like \"Scream\", only Japanese style.  The American take on the same scene however, seemed to speed up the telling of the urban myth that sets up the film's premise and came across more like a second rate \"Scream\" clone than a well crafted homage. However, as the opening sequence goes on, it's handling improves and it reveals that this remake is quite capable of serving up scares of it's own.The pace is more urgent in this version and the first few days of the curse fly past.  Events and characters also play out differently and much of the revelations are last day rather than spread out.  Such is the tension (a combination of direction and Naomi Watts's brilliant and riveting performance) that I almost completely forgot that something we're led to believe about Rachel (Watts) 's uncovering of the curse and impending doom is a red herring.\"The Ring\" retains the dreary rainy grey look of Hideo Nakata's original and the music and sound effects are also eerily reminiscent, which helps keep the creepy mood and gives the story anunsettling atmosphere.  There are also a few teasing nods to scenes and events from the Japanese sequels \"Ring 2\" and \"Ring 0: Birthday\".  One of \"The Ring\"'s strengths though is that it can both complement and differentiate from the Japanese cycle and stand in it's own right.  Sometimes I was unsure of what would play out and how it would play out from the original story.  If you're comfortably familiar with \"Ring\" there's still a few surprises in store.  Brian Cox (of \"Manhunter\" fame) plays a character who is actually an amalgamation of two characters from the original and the protagonist's mother is a bit different to Shizuko (her Japanese equivalent).  Shockingly so in one crucial scene.  There's also a real heart in your throat scene on the ferry involving a horse which is completely new and very effective.  Another main difference is that Noah initiallly seems oafish and gets properly involved in Rachel's investigation of the cursed tape a lot later on than in the Japanese version.  The film also concentrates more on building a family link between characters making their fate more emotionally important to the viewer.Now to some criticism of the film.  The backstory of Samara and the curse doesn't play out as effectively as that forSadako in \"Ring\" (1998) and seems a bit half sketched in comparison. Unfortunately the scary finale is one place (like the initial opening) where this film suffers in comparison to it's predeccesor, seeming more overblown and more sped up at the expense of subtlety and building tension.  This scene did seem to work well enough, it has to be said on audience members who probably hadn't seen the original, judging by their nervous giggles when the credits came up.Overall if you're a fan of horror that dares to be creative and genuinely scary, I'd urge you to see both this well crafted, spine-tingling, supernatural thriller and the terrifying Japanese films that inspired it.'\n",

I wasn't expecting something that would send me deep into the dark tunnels of my own paranoia and leave me locked in it for a few weeks. I will kid you not. I am a person that doesn't get scared easily and The Ring shook and crumbled the very foundation. Gore Verbinski takes the basis of Ringu, the original Japanese version, and mixes in his own little twists to create the most frightening movie of 2002.SPOILERSThere were two scenes that scared me the absolute most.A) The first being when Ruth tells Rachel about how Katie's face looked when they found her body and they do that quick flash of Katie's body falling out of the closet with that disturbing look of shock embedded in her face. What made that scene so eerie, besides the make-up, was the sound effects used and the fact that you weren't expecting it to happen at all.B) Whoever says that the scene with Samara coming out of the well and the TV in the end wasn't scary is probably lying because they refuse to admit it. That was the scene that sent me into paranoia because I have a TV in my room that's right in front of my bed. Imagine how frightened I was when I was getting ready for bed and having to eye my TV the entire time. The way it's shot and the way Samara moves sends your nerves straight to Hell.END SPOILERSThe film also showcases an excellent cast, including Naomi Watts, fresh off her voyeuristic role in Mulholland Drive, Martin Henderson, Brian Cox, and Daveigh Chase, who takes her sweet roles of Donnie Darko's younger sister and the voice of Lilo and totally changes into Samara, the black-haired, dead-eyed girl with a mind of pure evil.Be warned: don't see The Ring alone.'\n",

Yes, the tape was kind of creepy, and the noise that played during the tape, but pretty much everything else about it sucked. The acting was good, though, and so was the plot. However, they don't explain a damn thing. For instance: Who made the tape? Who calls you when you watch the tape? Why hasn't anyone in the movie ever heard of star-six-nine? *SPOLIER, I SUPPOSE* And when Rachel says, \"What did I do that he didn't?\", she comes to the conclusion that she made a copy. Well, yeah, AND you went down in the well and held the girl's corpse. And anyway, it's impossible to see a ring of light when you push a lid onto a well AFTER you see the half-moon shape.

And the ending was perfect.Easily 10/10'\n",

            "Review: 'Scary movies have had something of a renaissance over the past few years. After the devil-baby prime time of the early 1970s, the genre fell into horrible self-parody, high school squeal reflex actions, sex-and-death associations for post-pubescents, the franchising of countless sequels, and quick pocket change for many a B movie queen.But just when the self-parody-parody set in (e.g. \"Scary Movie\"), so came a few experiments that worked: The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, etc. The Ring, owing to its Japanese origins free from the American massacre of the American massacre film, qualifies among them. While it falls short on a lot of levels, many criticisms stem from my improved expectations from scary movies of late.To its credit, the movie delivers the scares. There's enough to keep your interest throughout the film, and for the most part the movie rides the right side of the scary-silly line. There's a lot of good and convincing acting. There's a good plot with the right amount of the unexplained to keep you guessing -- a nice change from most American movies where subtlety comes with a sledgehammer.But therein also lies some of its flaws. In the end there are clearly too many questions and inconsistencies left behind. For every question that might be best left unanswered for effect (***spoiler*** : for example, how was Samara conceived, and what made her evil), there were multiple inconsistencies in the plotlines that left the movie feeling incomplete. Other areas were spelled out that either detracted from the plot or added nothing (***spoiler***: Did you really have to show Samara crawling out the the TV? ***non-spoiler***: And what did it add that Aidan turned out to be the son of Rachel and Noah in some kind of Darth Vader-lite plotline?).As for plotline, to its credit, many parts worked. However, some did not. There were a few scenes where I had a far greater urge to laugh (and did) at a ridiculous situation than be frightened by it. And while unravelling the mystery makes for a good story, the 40,000-ft view of this movie is little more than a fatalistic episode of Scooby Doo.Sorry, but contrary to some opinions here, the child actor (David Dorfman) who played Aidan was stiff, annoying, and wholly unconvincing. It made me realize how much of a joke \"Sixth Sense\" could have been without Mr. Osment. By the end I was hoping for some kind of mythical man-month math, wanting Aidan to watch 7 copies of the tape so they could eliminate his character in a single day. But the performances by Naomi Watts and particularly Brian Cox are solid.Some scenes interestingly struck me as something lifted completely out of Japanese comic books or anime -- like the scene where Noah is first walking up to Rachel's apartment in the rain in his hooded coat, his wet hair flying about.The fact that I wrote this much about it says something. Despite all its flaws, it's a good movie (7/10). But the gaping holes and questions at the end are too much to call it a classic by any means.'\n",

Right, the movie was a mix of scream, the sixth sense, and final destination, and it wasn't really as original as those movies were, even if scream was terrible.Really not a bad movie, not great either.  I was laughing at some parts, and covering my eyes at others.  When they actually show things, it was funny, and I was cheering for the main characters to die, maybe that was just me. It's just those little cheap scares that get me.  I know they're coming too. Grow up, I know.I just have a few questions.  Might involve spoilers.  1.) where did this tape come from?  Did it just appear magically, like other VHS cassettes?  If the movie was shot 30 years in future would it have been a magic DVD?  Was the girl at the bottom of well using FCP to put this all together?  2.) Why does she kill the people?  For not passing on the message?  Come on.  Tell this girl to grow up.  My brother doesn't give me a phone message, I don't jump out of a TV and eat his brains.  Juvenille, really.  3.) Brian Cox is a wonderful actor, but seeing him kinda takes away from the film.  What happened to no stars, only talent?  He's just too famous.  I kept thinking he was gonna teach me to use this . . . or this . . . or get caught in a Lie. 4.) What is this girl still trying to prove?  The people who wronged her are dead.  It's not like kids are being glad bagged and tossed into wells all the time.  And why does she have to kill?  So violent. I tell you, kids these days.Right, the movie still is scary.  I was scared at some points, visually it's nice to look at, stylistically many elements are used well to give you a better perception of the story.  But when you look back at it, you're just like, wait, what?  Whoever said frailty was bad was right, that movie bit, the sixth sense wasn't really a horror movie so I find it hard to critique in terms of the genre.  And if you want to scream in the theater, be my guest.  It's what the movie is there to do. If you want to laugh along like me at some parts, and cheer for the characters to be killed, that's cool too baby.  I dug the hitch references, but there should have been nudity, come on.I'd give it a B or B+, but only for that crazy ending.  Otherwise B- or B. Anyway, peace out yo.'\n",

It's creepy and strange, but also totally hokey and full of plot holes. This is basically a teenage-level horror film that's pretending to be much more. It's an insult to the viewer's intelligence, as well as actual psychological thrillers like pretty much any Hitchcock, or more recently \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"The Others.\" My specific critiques are given below.*SPOILERS AHEAD* Firstly, the whole phone call thing. Lame. That was so unnecessary and was just plain silly. HOKEY. How many other scary movies did that plot point steal from? Creative.Second, the girl crawling out of the television. I seriously laughed out loud. That was supposed to be the scariest thing we've seen in a movie since \"The Shining\"? Please. It would have been much scarier if the people watching the video had gotten sucked into it.Third, the marbles forming in the shape of the arrow. Also laughed out loud there.Finally, and I think this was the main weakness of the movie. WHAT was Samara's motivation??? Up until the \"twist\", it at least seemed plausible that she was trying to be freed from her \"dark place.\" But when it's revealed that she'd been hurting people *before* that and her fall into the well was the result, not the cause, of her misdeeds, everything just unravels. The whole POINT of the psychological thriller is to reveal *why* the person is doing what they're doing. They hinted that the circumstances around her birth were suspicious-- why couldn't they carry that out a bit-- was she the spawn of Satan? A demon? Was she conceived by some voodoo curse? For cryin' out loud, give us something to work with. The whole \"Evil for evil's sake\" is a cop out and totally uninteresting.I'd give it a 5 out of 10.'\n",

At first I was skeptical about the teen element being involved (usually a cymbal crashing cue for long holds on tight shirts, tons of unnecessary screaming--not to mention screaming while \"running\" in high heels, and the most unabashed use of one-liners dredged up from every horror flick since the 70's), but thankfully that wasn't the case at all. The Ring was a truly edgy experience! The sound effects alone had me twitching, and I LOVED the puzzle of the video, its solution, and of course Samara's special effects most of all. The cinematography also gets an A+, beautiful work!As far as the acting, Brian Cox was OUTSTANDING (as usual); Naomi Watts was really believable (especially as an angry/frazzled single mom); Martin Henderson was INCREDIBLY hot.Now I realize that the only reason this film exists at all is because of the Japanese original (and of course the book) but what I don't understand is how anybody even thought that the original was \"scary/terrifying/astonishing/blah blahblah\". There weren't any special effects except for those annoying close ups and the screen changing colors (which is sooooo late 60's Hammer I can't even begin to go there). Sudako's \"death face\" had me on the floor laughing every time. If I'm watching a horror movie that is supposed to be legendary for scares, then I want to be scared; If I want to be stupidly amused I'll watch Freddy, Jason and Michael. I LOVE films that have plots that make you think and Japan has a ton of them, especially in horror, they're just not directed in a way that I find terrifying. Now the Japanese manga (comic books) based on The Ring series, THOSE are scary.The American version of The Ring is creepy as hell, and far above its original source.'\n",

I would give examples of movies that make you cower in your seat, knowing you can't stop the movie as it marches on, each frame more nerve-racking than the last. I will cite works like \"Poltergeist\", \"Sixth Sense\" and \"Blair Witch Project.\" These movies are scary. \"Jason X\" is cinema fodder. Having said that, let me go on to confirm that \"The Ring\" is one scary mother of a movie. Don't expect any big money shots from this thriller, it goes for tense and it doesn't let go. The film starts with the premise of an urban legend. There's a freaky Nine Inch Nails-esque video cassette, and after watching it, the phone rings. Answer it or not, you now have seven days before you die. Rachel Keller, a workaholic journalist, overhears some kids discussing it at the wake of Rachel's niece, a supposed victim of the tape. The movie does a good job of hiding the true evil. Because its not the tape itself that's doing the killing. Its a power behind the tape, the force that created it that follows the victims. By watching the tape, whatever's on the other side watches right back. There's a bizarre connection between the source of that power and any electronic device, puddles of ominous water, and a number of dead horses. It was either a convention of the filmmakers or a truly odd coincidence, but everyone under age 20 seemed to be either a little bit psychic, a little bit precognitive, or both. Rachel's son, who I believe was in kindergarten, had the creepiest eyes and monotone voice. I wondered a few times if that wasn't just some amazing make-up applied to Christopher Walken, but no, the kid's really that good.\n",
            "As far as the scarier elements go, its all about subtly here. When a conversation dies down, the phone will ring very, very loudly. TV's just turn on to static at full volume. In this movie, there's nothing scarier than what's waiting just around the corner. Using color, water, and almost miss able computer generated images, what's scary is the threat of what's coming. What I liked most about this movie was its unconventional ending. When you think the movie's getting done, it's just building its energy for a terrifying and memorable finale. I don't know what your preferences are as far as scary goes. I like nervously burying my face in my jacket. Some people like a guy with a knife jumping out of dark places with no explanation of how he got there. What I can tell you is that `The Ring' is scary. Enter at your own risk.'\n",

I have not seen the remake by itself, but I think the film does leave a lot of unanswered questions, that if they had been answered they would remove nothing from the film's atmosphere and they would have helped the audience understand something more about the relationships between the various people that only appear shortly. It is good to keep the parents and the daughter mysterious, but the few cryptic sentences they utter do not explain anything nor do they give them much character.

In the unrealistic, the \"killers\" may be some kind of robots, aliens, or in the case of The Ring, a videotape.  I like watching both types, but the realistic kinds scare me more because I walk out knowing something like that could really happen, or have happened.  There are 3 other groups to divide horror movies.  There's the scary ones(like Scream), the creepy/spooky ones(like The Others), and the sad/freaky ones(like The Ring).  This movie will probably scare some people, but not me.   I usually get scared at movies that have a lot of suspense and moments that make me jump.  This movie was suspenseful, but there was no moments to jump.  And I don't understand why people would scream.  It really is more of a mystery type movie than a horror movie.  And even though I gave this a 6/10, if you like horror movies you should watch it anyway.'\n",

            "Review: 'Spoilers!! While entertaining with good photography and mood, there were enough holes n the plotting to make me very disappointed with \"The Ring.\" Call me what you want, but here are some questions I have:1) So who made the videotape? 2) Why did the well appear under the motel room floorboards when we clearly see it was out in the field when the mom tried to kill the kid? 3) Why was it necessary to see that the kid had been kept in the room upstairs in the barn? It wasn't necessary to the plot. That's not where the kid spent the rest of her days. That's not where she was murdered. She was probably only there for a short while before her mom took her out to the well and tried to murder her. 4) How come there was no exploration of where the kid was adopted? That may have helped to explain her origins. 5) What's that whole confusing thing at the end about people who make copies can't be killed but those who are give the copy can? What? That's all I can figure out about why at the end she's making another copy with her son and they seem to feel they're not going to be killed, but maybe someone else is. Huh? 6) Do you actually have to pick up the phone and listen to the voice telling you you're going to die in 7 days, or doesn't it matter if you hear the message or not? And how do they get the phone number to call in the first place? 7) Why would a potential victim cause a horse to go crazy?I love horror and sci-fi films, but if they set up a universe where supernatural events occur, they have to follow their own internal logic. It's got to be real for the world the characters live in. Otherwise, it's just a film director throwing things at us like a big cheater and there's no point in understanding anything that goes on. The film just becomes a series of unconnected scenes and strange odd bits.'\n",

            "Review: 'There are several points in \"The Ring\" in which the movie almost reaches points of macabre brilliance. The opening scenes are edge-of-your-seat scary and the sadistic twist ending is nothing short of terrifying. Unfortunately, it's the long stretch in between those two points that is so disappointing.The Ring is about a mysterious videotape, the contents of which will kill you. A journalist (Naomi Watts) is on the story, but unfortunately she has seen the tape, which may ensure her death in seven days. Of course a premise like this requires the suspension of disbelief, but this movie never did it for me. The entire time it was obvious to me that I was just watching a movie. I was never absorbed.Which is a shame because The Ring had a big opportunity to really scare me. All the elements of a classic thriller are here, but few are really put to use. It builds atmosphere to be sure, but it does so entirely in cliches. Roll the thunder, cue the lightning, etc. In between the long stretches of expository dialogue and gray storm cloudy backdrops, there are a few very disturbing moments. After viewing this movie, I guarantee you will be wary around television sets, or whenever the phone rings. For a PG-13 movie, there are a lot of disturbing images, too. (Rotting corpses and the like.) Unfortunately, in a nutshell, The Ring is a thriller with all the disturbing elements of a horror film, but none of the thrills. So in the end, we're left with a movie that is nothing more than simply disturbing.(**/****)'\n",

I understand the movie makes great lengths to show that Americans live by their televisions, that's fine.  But here is one question, if your tv has just turned on twice without anyone turning it on (except for spoiler answer) and you are REALLY paranoid, why not go take a walk?  Leave the house.  Sit in a park, heck, sleep there.  OK, tv is the death of us all and society, the fact this movie made over 100 million in the box office alone really does prove that. BUT as a movie, horror fans (and I mean those born when HORROR movies were coming out, not most crap in the past 15 years) have seen this all before. The only addition is a good director.  The movie LOOKS good, it is shot wonderfully.  The problem is the movie itself.  The acting is not horrible, the script is, well, very long winded for a movie that had WAY too many fake jolts (you know, the \"insert violen shrill here when nothing happens\") and not any real moments of suspense. I will concede the movie is a good attempt of taping into eerie suspense (not really horror though) but only an attempt.  Recently, Signs is much better because it really puts a human - family - what would you do - aspect to it where in this film its more - stretch your brain - please? And for those who say this is the best scary film since the Exorcist, watch that movie again, it is a very dark comedy, not a horror film, and in my opinion, not a very effective dark comedy. Instead of this film, please watch the real classic \"horror\" films such as Carrie, The Last House on the Left, Zombie, Opera, Suspiria, Sleepaway Camp (yeah, you heard me), and many others. Again, not a terrible movie but for those who watch films of this nature who are over 20 years old (who saw the old movies before they were/are classics), this is a forgettable Sunday afternoon movie.'\n",

(2)  After they find the kid (which is supposed to exorcise the whole thing) her son says \"You weren't supposed to help her.\"  Thanks kid, that's a great time to bring that up.  I hate kids in movies who make things worse when they could be helping.  (3) What were they supposed to do?  Was there a way to stop it? (4) I kind of get the \"making a copy spares you\" thing - you're spared if you help the kid.  But why did the son ask what would happen to the person they showed it to?  Who said they have to show it to anyone?Of course they used the old horror film \"out\" of alluding to things that, if told, wouldn't work.  Like (a) how did they actually manage to have Satan's child?  (b) If they did all those bad things to her - why did daddy survive?

However, I have to say on a high level objective viewing of this film, \"The Ring\" was disappointingly tired.I really liked the film's premise (see A above).  Wouldn't it be frightening to know that in 7 days a creepy death will fall upon you?  The way in which the main character re analyzed the video a second time (Why not?  She's going to die anyway, right?) and discovered clues as to it's origin was fascinating.  The video itself was creepy and well done.  The young heroine's perseverance to get to the bottom of the video's meaning was riveting. ...and then I got tired, really tired.First off, I am tired of every creepy movie (see: The Shining, Six Sense, et. al.) having some young kid who 'sees inside of the mind of the evil doer.'  This movie has the same old clichés:  The boy says to mom \"She's yelling out to be released,\" and the boy draws deep disturbing pictures of a far off evil place using his crayons.  Of course, when the time comes that mom must figure out a clue or two - she turns to the son and says \"What is she trying to say?\"This has been done a million times.In lies my potential *spoiler*.  This movie has the proverbial person (in this case, a little girl) who 'disappeared' 25 years ago without a trace - she was abused by her parents who wanted a perfect child but became troubled when they discovered their only child had a mental illness.  So the child mysteriously 'disappeared.' ...and today, we have a young boy telling his mom \"She's yelling out to be released.\"This has been done a million times. ...and then I got tired, really tired.The visuals and special effects were good.  It was a good premise, yet it went so wrong - ESPECIALLY the ending.  Wait! Did the movie really end?This movie had all of the traditional clichés of 'catching up with the girl' by the end.  The movie should have ended.  But no.  When mom tells her son \"the girl has been released,\" her son replies \"what did you do that for? You shouldn't have done that!\"We get 20 more minutes.This movie had all the makings of a good creepy movie with a riveting premise.  But, inevitably it got tired with endless flashbacks, child clichés and a plot - not only done a million times - that would not end!'\n",

Although the premise is excellent and the images creepy, the total lack of logic both in the overall storyline and individual scenes made it so unbelievable that I stopped being scared long before the ending.SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERSThe niece Katie's attitude towards the tape seems inconsistent.  She doesn't tell her best friend until the witching hour is upon them (and then makes fun of the idea), yet she tells her much younger cousin she doesn't have much time left.  Also how did the rumor of the tape get started? Supposedly the tape got made by Katie and her friends trying to record a football game. If so, she and her friends were the first victims, and there shouldn't be any rumor that the tape actually killed people.Katie's mother asks her sister Rachel to look into the death because she doesn't understand why a 16-year-old's heart would stop suddenly.  Um - wasn't anyone concerned with the way Katie's body looked in those horrifying flashes?  (Especially given someone mentioned that \"seeing the body\" had been one of the things pushing the friend into madness).  I'd think any competent coroner would have some questions on how this girl looked drowned, bloated or worse.  The movie would have been a lot stronger if the victims had simply dropped dead of fright leaving beautiful corpses.The tape itself is fine - truly creepy.  And it makes sense that Samara broadcasting from the well could impose the images on the videotape being recorded near by.  But apparently she wasn't exactly limited  to geographical proximity, because long before the taping, she'd been out killing her mother and the horses.  As a matter of fact, this kid can use telephones, move objects at will at long distances, control electricity, and pretty much everything else even before she's `helped' out of the well. (I'm still wondering how she killed the kids in the car given they likely weren't near a television set).The horse scene was extremely well done, tho  it made no sense for Naomi to keep messing with the horse despite its rising agitation.  But then she does lots of inexplicable things, such as her penchant for leaving dead bodies unreported (except for Samara's).  Apparently she not only walked away from the father of her child, but she left Samara's father to be discovered by someone else after his extremely elaborate suicide.  (Still wondering why someone would go so far out of his way to electrocute himself especially with someone else in the house).A lot of the things that affect the characters don't have any explanation. My boyfriend suggested the scribbling over faces was meant to convey Samara's head had been put in the black plastic bag.   That might be, but what explanation was there for the distorted faces in pictures and videos? Or the nosebleeds for that matter.  A lot of times I felt the only motivation behind the things happening was that it would make the audience jump.All in all, a movie that should have gone straight to video where at least they could have gotten some real impact out of the self-referential stuff at the end about making a copy and showing it to someone else.'\n",

It would appear that her heart just stopped. But the girl's mother asks Rachel, who is a journalist, to try and figure out why she really died. What Rachel discovers is that her niece, along with the three other friends of hers, watched a video tape exactly seven days prior to when they all died simultaneously.The Ring has a rating of MA15+, and it earned it. This is a very scary film that will have you on tenterhooks the whole way through its many twists and turns, but is not exceptionally gory, nor are things jumping out at the central characters every few minutes. The film is scary because of the creepy way it goes about things, letting you only have another piece of the puzzle that Rachel is presented. But the frightening imagery that the film uses makes it creepier then the story would have been. The scenes that stay with you especially are Rachel's encounter with a horse, her final meeting with Richard Morgan, the owner of a horse ranch on Moesko Island, and the gripping finale.But, the powerful imagery doesn't only come in the forms of scares. Certain scenes, like one simple scene where Rachel stands on her apartment's balcony and looks out at other people's lives gives us a snapshot into other people's lives, just showing that everyone you see has a tale to tell, something different from the last, and that people always have secrets.This film for me doesn't come under the \"horror\" category, but rather the \"thriller\" category, even though it is a very frightening piece of cinema. It is a classic, and even though it's a very scary piece of film, it's easily recommendable.'\n",

I wont reveal the exact plot but i will make a couple of general comments on it so if you belong to the category of viewers that don't wish to know anything about the storyline don't read any further.The first observation is that the actual killings are not shown while committed .This \"just before and after\" approach which is handled well gives the film a less bloody profile and effectively helps to remove of it the label of \"another horror movie\" since bloodbaths have become very much a cliché that provokes disgust but not necessarily fear. But is the movie a thriller proper? Well , if you expect at the end of it to leave the movie theatre with all the answers you will be a little bit disappointed.As in most movies that employ the supernatural as part of the explanation more questions than the ones answered are created and that for me is not a triviality.. If on the other hand you are not bothered with such approaches you can be sure that you will be in happy agony for 2 hours .It is certain that you wont regret your choice to see this otherwise impressive piece of film making. i would rate it 7.5/10'\n",

            "Review: 'In 1999-2000, I spent a year in Korea teaching English. While there, I had a very surreal experience. Before the summer of 1999, all Japanese imports, including films, were banned in Korea. Beginning that summer, the moratorium on Japanese cultural imports was lifted. One of the first Japanese films released in Korea at this time was \"Ringu.\" However, since it needed to be captioned into Korean, it was released six months after it's initial release in Japan, just in time to be in theaters with the Korean remake, \"Ring.\" (Apparently this is why the American remake was called \"The Ring.\") My surreal experience was going to see the Japanese version in a multiplex also showing the Korean \"Ring\" at the same time, with all the Koreans panning the Korean version and flocking to the Japanese version.Back to the topic at hand, I liked the American version better than the Japanese version. The Japanese \"Ringu\" was basically what I call a \"yap\" movie, where the there's so much story that all the characters can do is basically make discoveries and discuss it with each other. The American version has much more action, and is much faster-moving than the original.However, a copy is still a copy. The final scene where the \"monster\" is revealed is much more effective in the original, just because to me, it's the 2nd time I've seen it. Others who watch the remake first may disagree. (What interests me, however, is that I think the American version used the exact same clip and/or technique as the original version. Close viewing of the \"monster\" scene shows that it was filmed in reverse and played forward, just like the original.)But, the American version didn't just copy the copy of the original, but threw in a whole bunch of other modern themes as well, such as the creepy little girl (The Others), the little quasi-psychic boy (The Sixth Sense), the quest for a father theme (The Rookie,) and female protagonist not dying (I know what you did last summer, Scream, Halloween, too many others to count.)Overall, the highest complement I can give this film is that I didn't feel ripped off, which is pretty high praise nowadays.'\n",

First off with the vagueness of the trailers you really don't know what to expect and I tried not to find out too much about the movie ahead of time--my usual practice with scary movies because lately the movies seemed ruined by the detailed trailers. So going into this movie all I was thinking was \"When you see the ring, you die.\"The suspense was terrific! The shock/surprise of the first scary image (if you've seen the movie you know what I'm referring to) was awesome. And then of course from their it just builds and builds until THE scariest movie scene I've ever watched (to date, that I can remember). I definitely give this film two thumbs up! Don't read too much about it, if you can, it'll increase the fear factor.And a bonus was you didn't figure the whole story out 15 minutes into the movie. I'm notorious for guessing the entire plot and then sitting for an hour and a half waiting for it to play itself out. Not with this movie. About halfway through I even turned to my sister and said \"I don't know where they're going with this...I am confused.\" LOL it was great. So definitely give this movie a view or two. And thanks to the creators for restoring my faith in the scary movie makers ;)'\n",

They rave on and on about how terrifying it is, how creepy the little girl is, how unexpected the ending is, etc. I wasn't sure if I wanted to believe them, seeing as most horror films I had seen in the past were pretty dull.Now, after having seen it, I can say that it lived up exactly to my own expectations: boring and slightly trite. The only thing remarkable about this film is the originality of it's basic idea (from the original Japanese film \"Ringu\"). A journalist and your basic horror movie creepy psychic kid are chased by an even creepier raggedy undead girl who kills people one week after they see a cursed tape by coming out of their TV and, I don't know, consuming their life essence or something. Originality is really the only thing going for this movie. Everything else, from the acting to the sound, is just pretty unmemorable.If you're desperate for a psychological horror movie, turn your attention to \" The Silence of the Lambs\" or the underrated \"Secret Window\".

My husband and I saw this film in a packed theatre (yes, with many teenagers), and it was one of those intense audience experiences in which you can almost hear everyone breathe (or not) at the same time.

No, but I can honestly say it's been only in retrospect that I've been concerned about discrepancies and ambiguities; while it was going on, I had to keep reminding myself that this was just a movie . . .

The little boy appears to have potential but they actually used the Sixth Sense technique & had him whispering on the phone.  (remember the \"I see dead people.\" scene?) They actors were good looking for the most part, if that's a redeemable quality, then The Ring gets a point on that. There is a surprise albeit predictable (if you've watched more than 3 scary movies in your lifetime) ending. Surprise in that you think the movie is over but then it continues on. Surprise.Scary?

The Ring tells the story of a reporter named Rachel (Naomi Watts) who while investigating the strange death of her 16 year old niece discovers a tape she and her 3 friends (who are also dead.) watched a week ago. She watches the tape herself, which contains strange images of a woman, dead horses and a lighthouse to name a few as well as a ring shape. After watching the movie the phone rings telling her she has 7 days to live. Rachel starts on a mission to discover the meaning of the movie and who made it and why before her 7 days are up and she dies. The movie contains so many plot twists and turns after this, delivering up scary and scarier things that leave you completely freaked out and chilled to the bone. The final ending (a HUGE plot twist that turns the ending from a semi-happy one to a terrifying one) had me just horrified. You will never look at a tv set the same way again. This movie is definetly worthy of being called a horror, it relys on the sharp wit of the writers and director to create some very chilling scares rather than gory blood and guts. The pacing of this film was perfect, leaving you on edge almost the entire film. The acting while not excellent was impressive, if you are of a faint heart I don't recomend this movie; it will scare you in a psychological way and trust me it leaves the theatre with you! Excellent horror, SO SCARY!!!! 9/10'\n",

I think those people have an inability to appreciate foreign films or lack proper reading skills to read the subtitles.  The Japanese version is far superior than the US version. THE Ring had questions that were answered very quickly and easily in the movie. Ring (I'd rather not say Ringu) is more of a mystery because many things are left to the unknown like the video tape. Everything in the video tape for THE Ring was explained unlike the video tape in Ring. I believe one of the things the the filmmakers in the Japanese version set out to say is that the unknown or uncertainty is what scares us. Having everything explained in the US version is like saying \"Americans are stupid, let's make the movie make since.\" Something Dumbworks...er Dreamworks likes to say. So, as you can see, I recommend watching the Japanese version.'\n",

            "Review: 'This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, right next to the Blair Witch. Basically, this is the premise: A bunch of teenagers watch what looks to be a Marylin Manson or Nine Inch Nails music video on a VHS tape they find in a motel in the woods. Then they get phone calls from a ghost who politely tells them they will die in 7 days (gives them time to buy life insurance policies, I suppose). Then in seven days an 11 year girl crawls out of their TV sets and beats the snot out of them. I'm serious, it really is that stupid.Eventually, the protagonist of the story decides to copy the tape thus allaying her own demise at the hands of the vengeful cathode ray tube spector. That is right, everybody who has seen it has to copy the tape to avoid having a little girl climb out of their TV and beat the crap out of them. There were many elements blatantly stolen from other movies (such as the sixth sense). In all fairness, the production values and special effects were pretty good and there were a few choice gory scenes. But for the most part this was an immensely stupid movie that scared no one.Wait for this one to come out on cable TV or borrow it from someone who has the DVD. DO NOT PAY TO SEE IT. IT IS NOT WORTH PAYING FOR.'\n",

            "Review: 'Good God. The Ring is probably the only true horror classic we've had in the past decade, and is more frightening than many of the other classics one can name. It's a shame that more people don't realize how deep and well-crafted this movie truly is, and how well the visuals tie together the whole film. It really helped me appreciate how nearly everything in the entire movie meant to frighten can be traced all the way back to Samara's experience, because throughout the whole movie, she is forcing everyone to share her experience. Take a look at all the deaths that happen in the movie. What is similar about them? Watch it again, and you'll see it's just another way of Samara forcing others to share her pain. The visuals in this movie are tremendous and subtle; I recommend that anyone go slowly through the tape scene, just to see where these visuals are repeated, and where they come from. You've noticed that I haven't said anything of the actors or the plot. They're really secondary to me, even if they all give decent performances. And I'm not going to even mention The Scene near the end of this movie. If you've seen it, you already know it is probably one of the most frightening things ever filmed. In the end, this movie is sucha totally solid and coherent piece, because nearly every moment of it seems to be haunted by the presence of a little girl who has seen horrible things and will never stop sharing them with you.'\n",

Also i did a test i have the original and saw it long before this one, so now saw the new US version (lol didn't scare me 1 second) and when i got home i putted the original in my tapeplayer again thinking this time the original wouldn't scare me, well euhhh it did, the way the things are filmed, putted in screen, the lights the little video frames puts you in sort of uncomfortable way. Also they mix something up here in the originalk she does alot to save not her but her SON! Here in this one her son seems more like a devil part that knows more then he should now a bit looking like \"the Sixth sense\" what has absolutly nothing to do with it.Anyway nice try on the remake, but the scary scenes from the original are completly taken away, not frightening, a new version of the tape completly missed and some other errors.You gave it a 10 go see the original and you gone reset your points. Only thing i wait is \"The Ring 2\" the sequel of the original made by the same original screenwriter and director.Oh by the way i really wanted to say Well done lately to the japanese Movies because they teaching some directing arts to the US that seem lost lately to find a good scenario.

Not with this one. I am trying to get behind the secrets of this movie, what it should express, follow hints that are given to try and get the bigger picture. It freaked me out, scared me to death. A roller coaster ride from the very beginning and you do hope it might end every second. Once finished,exhausted and disturbed, I was glad it was over and I survived... Not that I am not into a good shocker or can't handle the ones I have seen before butthis is something new. A modern gothic horror that leaves many questions unanswered but this exactly makes it worth watching it another time...if youdare to go through all this again... I am burning for to get it on DVD , even though I know what happened and how it ended I don't know anything,want to solve the mystery behind Samaras existence, the reason for what she did, what Rachel's intentions are, what role the Innkeeper played and howwho could have been saved and more victims be avoided... With its special effects, back flashes and \"art-student-like\" video shots this is something new in the era of horror/thriller films it occupies you from the very first shot until the very last. Even though I felt like I knew what happens next all the time during the movie, it came even worse and more terrifying. But the less you know about this one and the less you expect the better...so get in there, watch it and think about how you feel like the next seven daysonce you've made it... if you'll make it...'\n",

Here comes the SPOILER....The horses all comitted suicide. I assumed it was because Samara didn't like them because they were supposedly keeping her awake in the barn, perhaps. Remember the oft-repeated line, \"She doesn't like it in the barn..the horses keep her awake.\"Well, HELLO...another oft-repeated (and even illustrated) trait of hers was that SHE NEVER SLEPT. They said this about a dozen times and even showed her staying awake for days on the time-lapsed footage from the camera in her room in the psych hospital.I would love to be wrong about this but I don't think that I am. Wonder if the much-lauded original contains this same error....Some very fine moments in this movie that will scare the most jaded of us, but overall I would have to say it definitely does NOT live up to the hype that it is the next \"Sixth Sense\".

The acting is weak, the editing is weaker, and the plot holes, some ridiculous dialogue and unrealistic events keep it well within B-movie status. It is entertaining but you'll be left unsatisfied at the end of the movie, feeling like too much was left out and that the whole script and movie was a sloppy effort.The premise in this movie is enough to radiate fear. But from there everything goes downhill although there are one or two nicely done scares. But this is a not great movie, nor even a very good one. That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining but it is instantly forgettable. The audience had a few shriekers and a lot of laughers because of some silliness in the film. I'm looking forward to seeing the Japanese version.The biggest crime in the creation of this movie is the total lack of depth to the script or reasons behind what goes on. Things happen just \"because.\" It's so silly that at the end you say \"well why did that happen? Most good horror movies give you the reasons and answers but this one leaves you with questions, namely, how in the world did this movie get made with such open holes?

Instead, it felt as if the filmmakers had to wring out the last bit of energy possible for no good reason at all.

Others think it was pretty stupid.THE RING is modeled after a Japanese horror film called RINGU. (It's supposed to be better, check it out.)After the mysterious death of her niece, Rachel (Naomi Watts) starts trying to unveil the mystery. She finds and watches a videotape that, seven days after you watch it, will kill you. From there, she also finds the tragic story of the Morgan family. Rachel is determined not to die, and does her very best to figure out the videotape.Does she? Watch the movie.The videotape itself is pretty disturbing ... a bunch of random images is what you see at first, but as the movie goes on, you begin to piece together those images with parts of the plot. The only thing that kind of annoyed me was that, when one of those times comes, when something about the videotape begins to make sense, they show that part of the videotape and don't let the viewer figure it out for his or herself.Anyway, this movie is sort of more of a psychological horror--if something like this really happened, you'd be pretty scared. Admit it. I would give THE RING an 8 out of 10.'\n",

The business about the horses is spooky, but not really anything to do with the main plot. The same goes for the stuff about the barn. The director appears to have thrown in stuff from Ringu 2, without any regard for whether it belongs in this film or not.Then there was the child actor who played Aiden. His performance wasn't as convincing as that of Takashi Yamamura as Yoichi in the original, and I really couldn't bring myself to care too much what happened to him, which killed the suspense.SPOILER WARNING I also found it puzzling how after Richard electrocutes himself in the bathtub (in a shocking, but gratuitous scene) Noah suddenly arrives virtually out of nowhere, then they seem to make it back to the cabin on the mainland in an unreasonably short length of time.Rachel's choice of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a tape to replace with the cursed video seems pointlessly nasty.

You watch the tape, you get a phone call, and you die in seven days. She starts to research where the tape came from in an attempt to stay alive.The Ring is really more of a detective story than a traditional thriller. The video is laden with clues as to where the video came from. It's a well-constructed mystery with seriously creepy overtones.Verbinski nails it. Even from the first scene, he shows a real understanding of how to do suspense. You really get a sense that something is lurking around every corner, behind every door. He shows real promise, which is a lot more than he did with The MexicanNaomi Watts is great in her role. She always has this wide-eyed look like something is seriously awry. Martin Henderson is pretty good as her boyfriend Noah, who helps her research the origins of the tape. David Dorfman as her son Aidan is a little too reminiscent of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, a kid who's a little too precocious, not quite realistic enough. The role requires a little more innocence than he delivers.Hans Zimmer's score is fairly run-of-the-mill for suspense, but it's capably done. He adds to the suspense and mood well. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is gorgeous, laden with deep hues and lush colors. Extremely well-suited to the project.The only problem I really had with the film is the ending. I can't spoil anything for you, as part of the goodness of the film is the way that it unfolds. But the ending isn't quite as emotionally satisfying as one would hope for. It pulls that typical trick of most suspense movies, leaving it too open for a sequel. (Two sequels have been made in Japan, as well as a prequel.) But it's as well-constructed a horror movie as I've seen in quite a while.'\n",

She had some singularities. And her adoptive parents put her into psychiatric hospital where she was alone for many hours, she lived in a stable and in the end her adoptive mother broke her in the well. As for me it is a enough reason to take offense. Some people write that it is very non-original and stupid story and many films has story like this. Yes this story is very simpler than story in book of Koji Suzuki. But main mean of this is not a difficult, long and very interesting criminal story. Americans when they were making this remake they didn't understood this idea. They tried to make a very scary film. So they put this in their film (this history is modified history from book of Koji Suzuki) but their main intensification was directed to make a good action.

            "Review: 'I had high expectations for this movie and they were fulfilled.  The trailer itself represented what the film would be: a montage of dark, creepy, dreadful events filmed and portrayed in a dark, creepy, dreadful way. The fact that a videotape kills people a week after they watch it is not what makes this film scary; if that were so then the ridiculous Feardotcom would have also been scary. The Ring is scary because of the way it is filmed and presented. As others have said, there is a feeling of dread constantly present and as the plot unravels, the dread takes over you until finally when Samara emerges with climactic terror you realize exactly why Verbinski wanted you to feel so much dread. I saw this movie the first time in a packed theater and the second time in a less-than-half-full crowded, and obviously the first time my experience was enhanced.  The second time allowed me to go back and review things I didn't notice the first time, such as the reason victims scribble out faces of people in pictures with a black pen is to represent Samara and her black hair covering her face after being in the well; and the reason the horse on the boat went crazy is because it was nearing Moesko Island, where all horses were put on a spell by Samara to drown themselves.  I noticed other little things that made the movie seem that much better.  Naomi Watts's superb acting, as well as good supporting acting by Martin Henderson, is extremely successful. Cast is important; someone like, say Keanu Reeves, for the role of Noah would have been disastrous. Kudos also to Rick Baker for creating a horrifying appearance for Samara's victims.While I've yet to see Ringu (I have to find a place where I can order it) and therefore cannot compare the two, I admit that The Ring is a fantastic film and contains everything I look for in a true horror film.  The lack of blood and guts and special effects and men running around with ghost masks and steak knives, and the ability for Verbinski to scare audiences with just plot, acting, camerawork, lighting, editing, and direction is what makes this one of my favorite horror films. Soon I will see Nakata's version and will be able to truly appreciate it all. But for now, I rate The Ring ten out of ten.'\n",

It was rather faithful to the original, made good use of atmospheric elements as well as providing a good setting for some fairly good acting. But, unfortunately, it was incapable of keeping the viewer's attention focused on the atmosphere and had to rely on what I deem cheap camera fast-panning tricks (*rapid movement* followed by \"Boo, are you scared yet?\") and gore (blood/decomposing bodies), something that the original had none of, which leads me to believe that Hollywood is incapable of making a horror film that will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat without the use of these two rather amateurish features.This film does make me wonder why everytime a quality film is made in a non-Hollywood studio, America always has to vandalise this original piece of work and attempt to Americanise it by remaking it into a white-Caucasian, adrenaline joyride. Are our colonial cousins incapable of savouring an original piece of work in its original form? Or is this simply a testament to a fast-food culture where reading subtitles is simply too much effort?Anyway, I'm getting carried away once again.

            "Review: 'I saw The Ring (Gore Verbinski, 2002) yesterday.I went by myself to the cinema, leaving my fiancée at home by herself (knowing that the movie would be far too much for her). I was almost an hour early and waited upstairs, staring blankly at a large TV whilst watching the trailers of countless movies to come. The hour passed swiftly and I was soon inside the cinema theatre, seated happily in my usual spot (yes, I'm one of those sad people that always sits in seat B12). No popcorn, just a half full bottle of cherry coke. The movie started ominously. The Dreamworks' logo crackled. Glee. Joy. Happiness. I'm a Ring fanatic.The original (Ringu, 1998) by Japanese director Hideo Nakata, chilled me to the bone. The sequel (Ringu 2, 1998) and prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) were equally potent. They're all members of that fading school of horror cinema in which blood makes almost no appearance (or if present, is a catalyst to the atmosphere, rather than a tool overused by the director to weed out the squeamish). I must admit at this point that I have not seen the Korean remake Ring Virus (1999) also known as Ring, but am planning on getting it from Hong Kong when I can scratch up enough cash to buy a few more oriental horror movies. It's high on my list.Back to the Hollywood English-language remake by Gore Verbinski: I was positively thrilled. He was almost entirely faithful to the Japanese version, but fortunately he also added to the entire Ringu mythology with certain elements. He anglicised others, changing the name Sadako to Samara for instance, and used Western imagery instead of Oriental. He added nice elements of symbolism such as the burning tree, the stagnant water that seeps through the floorboards and under doors, the entire equestrian idea, and others. Fortunately, they all worked well. Gore Verbinski did however add a little gore, taking a bloodless film and adding the odd writhed, decomposed body - a rare occurrence, granted (there is far less gore in this film than in the mainstream Se7en, 1995), but one that Nakata did not use. My feelings about this are quite mixed, but as a whole, I think I liked it.The best way to look at the 2002 remake version is to quite simply look at it as an entirely new film. If you do this, you will not be disappointed. If you look at it in the context of the Japanese versions (and Korean, I imagine), you will find this a thrilling appendix to the Ringu mythology. Either way, you will enjoy it. Unless you are part of that large group of people that actually ran out of the theatre half-way through the film yesterday afternoon. That is always a good sign.Personally, I found that the English-language remake version was as strong, if not stronger than either of the other sequels, but still remain adamant that the original Ringu is both more potent and horrifying than any of its offspring. This is the only horror film in which I have seen myself obliged to switch the light on to watch (I own Ringu, Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 on DVD). The final Sadako scene in Ringu is the most frightening, terrifying, chilling and unreal scene I have ever set eyes upon. Samara's final scene in The Ring is almost there, but this is where I must loudly voice my disapproval of Verbinski's handling of this scene: He cut it with the Rachel's car scene, dispelling in my eyes the uncut, continuous horror of Samara's appearance. This is in my eyes, the single flaw of the Verbinski version.I would recommend this film to all the horror fans out there. This is without a doubt an unforgettable movie and it will hopefully lead you onto a desire to watch the Japanese and Korean versions. Do not see this if you have even the slightest heart conditions or are easily spooked. You will run out of the cinema. Another word of warning: This is not an easy film to watch; it demands your entire commitment to the story and especially the atmosphere (the soundtrack is amazing). Do not watch this film (or its forefathers) on DVD whilst munching popcorn and chatting with your friends. This is not \"Watch over the weekend during a Horror movie marathon\" material. Your attention is required from beginning to end, switch off the light, pull out the phone cord, close the doors, and be afraid. Be very afraid.I shall now go and build a little shrine to Ringu. Or I might go and watch it again.'\n",

Actually - the number of actual deaths was minimal - surprisingly.As our journalist proceeds through the film racing against her ultimate deadline (as expected, she watched the film, and is left with seven days to solve this mystery) she (and we) learn the origins of the tape and the reasons for the mysterious deaths.Being a film made for American audiences, it carries a number of predictable elements, and these are ultimately forgiveable.  For a film with such a broad audience base (PG13 in Canada), it did remarkably well with its restrictions.  The deaths and the surrounding circumstances are quite creepy.  There aren't a lot of jump-in-your-seat moments, but rather the director opted to set a creepy mood with the dusty yet sterile hospital environments, and the foggy/rainy outdoor scenes.  While these can be overly familiar, they do work here, and the mood is set.As the story unfolded, I found myself increasingly engaged in the plot. With each revelatory encounter, the thirst for more grows, and you want and need to see what lies around that next corner.  The plot twists are minimal - the story follows a fairly linear path.  The main thing that sets this movie apart is its ending - choosing survival, the journalist does the unthinkable (see the film if you further insight).Ultimately - The Ring employed familiar horror film tactics with the eerie score, sudden noises and spooked animals, but it managed to tell an original creepy tale using imagery (the stuff on that tape were just creepy and will give you willies after dark).  It blended the artsy elements quite well with the Hollywood elements.  It could have easily been a re-hash of \"Shocker\" and it could have readily gone into Fellini-esque territory - but instead it straddled those and gives a solid and good story.  I rank it an 8/10.  Not brilliant, but memorable.'\n",

            "It is a movie about a second t.v. within your own that contains a creature that is a girl of silent and demonic fear. And if ever that girl should come through and into the real world so help us....Here is the trick psychology-effect: If the demonic fear is able to transcend the boundaries of one television set, what will prevent it from transcending the second? \"Relax, its just a movie\" we tell ourselves- or is it? You can see how it takes that old comfort-saying and rips it to shreds.Rent it on video to recieve the greatest effect- far more than watching it in theaters.Basically, the audience recieves a sense of safety and security by seeing how the source of fear is contained behind a television set and within a video tape. Then we are given this idea that looks can be deceiving when we buy into the chance that the little girl is not evil after all, but is only trying to find a way to rest in peace after death, \"hey! she's harmless!\"... or is she? the twist gives us a hard-hitting blow to the head when we discover to our disappointment that this demonic evil has the ability to \"pretend to be nice like the rest of us.\" This concept is brand new and fresh, unlike any horror film I have ever seen, and you have I bet.Another brilliant idea is the physical form of the evil itself- it came in those good old fashion electromagnetic waves that has entertained america and the rest of the world for decades. It should really mess up the mind and provoke the semi-intelligent viewer who I doubt would have picked up on these underlying concepts the way I did. But that is the intention which is too obvious to be recognized and the brilliance behind the movie.That is all I have to say for this.'\n",

Sure these companies have got the money got the actors but the films never quite cuts it. I have seen many many horror films one of the best by far and always will be is the exorcist the same as starwars for science fiction films, however the ring was up they some where with the exorsist, i love the 80s and 90s horror flicks they were the best and always will be. It was so refreshing to watch a truly excellent horror film the story the acting the effects it was great.But be warned this film is about as dark as it can get it gets into your head and stays they for a little while. As so many new horror films go wrong in todays society they forget the one thing that so many lack ,psychology fear.Remember when we were kids we were all terrified of what was under the bed ,when the bedroom light was turned off they are no boundaries of fear nor the imagination. If you can put this mental feeling into an audience for an hour and a half you are on to a winner, the ring did just that one of the best horror films i  have watched up to date horror writers take note.'\n",

So many horror movies today are so intent on shoving gore and depravity in your face (*cough Saw*) that its refreshing to watch a horror movie that just lets its spooky story creep under your skin. Everything from the water motif to the strange and disturbing videotape is scary and different enough to not feel totally clichéd.That being said, its not free of clichés. There is a little boy who draws a lot of creepy pictures (like, um, every horror movie in recent history). For some reason this movie's clichés didn't bother me as much as usual, though, because unlike other movies, The Ring wasn't built on clichés, it just borrowed them for its story. The excellent score by Hans Zimmer also helps move the film along and add to its dark, heavy mood.A very enjoyable and fresh horror film.'\n",

Visually, I loved this movie. But I watch for the plot, and there wasn't much of it here. \"The Ring\" is the detailed story of a chain letter. It is one of the \"pass it on or die\" stories that I'm sure we've all seen at one time or another. Yes, this is much better written than a usual e-mail, but it's still, in my opinion, an overused and cheap plot. I laughed at the first few scenes of the movie, but from there it went downhill. There were clichéd characters (the skeptical detective, the all-knowing young child, the creepy little girl) and unoriginal exposition techniques. As the story progressed, I began to enjoy \"The Ring\" a bit more, but it left many unanswered questions and loose ends that I feel should have been tied up. Many interesting characters are introduced, and their histories are extremely important to the plot, but we only receive the very minimum information. So many ideas are introduced and never properly explored. I was left wondering at the end of the movie--not thoughtful, more exasperated that they hadn't included more information. Throughout the movie, I never related to any of the characters and never felt like we got a grip on who they were. Each character has a role in the movie, but their stories feel not fully developed and I think this could have been improved upon. If you are looking for a beautiful film with good colors, interesting shots, and carefully placed details, \"The Ring\" isn't a bad movie to watch. But if, like me, you care more about the plot than anything else, I wouldn't recommend it.'\n",

The image of a trashed and dilapidated room suddenly flickers something unexpected.  This movie was even more chilling.I agree that the plot in no way borrows from The Sixth Sense, although the creepy, staticky TV brings back memories of Poltergeist.  One thing this movie shares with The Sixth Sense is its timing.  Like that movie, the big scares in this movie aren't necessarily from something suddenly jumping out. Instead a mood of horrible anticipation is built and then some slight appearance, perhaps in the background, makes your heart skip a beat.  Even the surrealistic movie-within-the-movie conveys a powerful menace without being overtly horrific.  I suspect some subsonics for mood enhancement but the haunting cello music track works very well.As far as the plot being incomprehensible, I think things are explained very well.  Almost too well.

            "Review: 'According to a good many people, The Ring is one of the best horror movies ever made. I haven't seen a lot of horror movies, but I don't see how that could possibly be good news for the genre. My chief complaint with the movie is that it left far too many plot holes. I appreciate the thought-provoking open-endedness of REALLY GOOD FILMS, but when I find myself trying to stuff the cracks in the script as the credits are rolling, I think there's something wrong. Here are some, but not all, of the questions that should have been answered (spoilers):1. What did the images in the video actually represent, other than as a means to let Rachel find out the story? Why was Anna brushing her hair in the mirror? Why the lighthouse? Why the bugs? I understand the hair theme and the water theme, but doesn't that seem to be st-re-tch-ing things a bit far?2. How did Aidan know what was going to happen to his cousin? At the beginning of the movie, he was drawing pictures that predicted it. Shouldn't he just have been an innocent little kid at that point? And how did he find out all about Samara in order to make his smart little comments at the end of the film? Surely Rachel didn't tell him? Incidentally, another complaint I have is that the climax was far too weak. I completely missed the fact that it WAS the climax (when Samara kills Noah). In fact, I was sure that Aidan WAS Samara and that THAT was how the movie would end. That would have given the scriptwriters a chance to explain some things that they left out.3. Why did Anna go crazy? Because the horses went crazy? Why did THEY go crazy???? This was never even TOUCHED upon. I don't even see why there were horses in the movie at all, except as some sort of filler, and there's nothing I hate more than a movie that has to resort to fillers.4. What was Richard Morgan's role in the movie? Anna killed Samara, they were kind enough to show us that, but then why did Richard act like HE was responsible? Why did he kill himself?5. How did Samara make the video? Why a video at all, for that matter? To give this movie some sort of PLOT? Couldn't somebody somewhere have come up with SOME explanation before they starting shooting?6. Who was Becca? She was with Katie when she died, but there's no explanation for what happens to her afterward and why she ends up in a psych ward. She knew what would happen. Was SHE somehow Samara? They had the same color hair. I've already suggested how Aidan could have become Samara, but they couldn't both have been. And if Becca WAS Samara, why wasn't that pointed out cohesively in the movie? And if she was, that opens up the plot to even MORE holes than it had without that explanation. They're pretty self-evident, so I won't point them out.7. Conceivably, every single other one of my questions could be left to the viewer's imagination to figure out, but there is one (at least, that I'VE thought of) gigantic glaring plot hole that simply can't be overlooked: Where did the tape of Samara in the psychiatrist's office come from? Not specifically where did it come from, but how did it even exist? Samara is talking about the things that she's doing, the pictures that just appeared and blah blah blah. Shouldn't she be dying in a well at that point? Or, if the psych tape was made before she was killed, why was she so bitter already? Did she know her mother would kill her? Was she just plain evil? In that case, why did the video include images from the well, specifically THE RING? Maybe I could sit here and invent an explanation, but as I said earlier, if I'm going to have to write the script myself I at least want my name to go in the credits.In conclusion, The Ring is not a bad movie, just a tad misguided. There were things that could have been done and ought to have been done to eliminate at least some of the holes in the plot, and made a better movie. I give it 4 points for actually being scary (I'm not sure how well I'll sleep tonight) and 2 points for stringing a few plot elements together to come up with something. Some movies have no plot whatsoever and thankfully, this wasn't one of them. I really wanted to like the movie, but it just wasn't what it should have been. .............6/10'\n",

Despite its inherently implausable premise (a haunted video tape) the Japanese movie had enough atmosphere and interesting scenes and characters to make it a worthwhile piece of film.Surprisingly, the American remake is not a total disaster. Of course, it has been Hollywood-ized greatly and, needless to say, it doesn't improve on the original, but it is not without merit.There is some interesting imagery and some chilling moments (though most of the scares come from unexpected loud noises). Funnily enough, I could detect an influence from the trashy horror movie 'Final Destination' -particularly the water motif and a sequence towards the end.The writer and director have tried to explain the story of Samara more than the original did. This works in some respects but really could have been developed further (and the CGI used near the end was not necessary).The worst change is the new version of the video tape which is crap. Not scary at all -it looks too professional and well made. Also, the soundtrack throughout the film is too overpowering -a bit of subtlety would have been nice.Naomi Watts has had some bad press for her acting in this film but I thought she was fine. The actor who annoyed me most was the one playing the little boy -he just did a poor impression of Haley Joel Osment in the 'Sixth Sense'.The more you think about the film, the more stupid it seems, but whilst you're actually watching it, it is an effective and quietly disturbing movie. Still, see the original!5/10'\n",

            "Review: 'After watching countless horror movies (13th Ghost, The Haunting, etc.), it's been a long, long time since I've experienced the gasping and hair-raising sensation from watching the Ring.  The director did an excellent job at elevating those tense moments without giving it all away. I even rented Ringu to see how they compare, and not to sound like a \"homer\", the U.S. version was much better.  I felt it was more intense. This movie is so good, I have to list in as one of the top 10 horror movies I have seen:1. The Excorcist 2. The Omen 3. Night Of The Living Dead (1968) 4. The Sixth Sense 5. The Ring 6. The Blair Witch Project 7. The Thing (1982) 8. Poltergeist 9. A Nightmare On Elm Street 10. The ShiningLet's just hope that unlike the Japanese version, this doesn't lead to a slew of sequels.'\n",

I borrowed this film yesterday because I was curious why people where so into this film.I spent the whole time heckling it and making snarky comments about it because it was not even the slightest bit scary. It was just a movie with a barely there plot line with lots of lame, random images that were suppose to be freaky. I was able to sit through the whole thing and instead of feeling scared, had to resist the urge to laugh all the way through.The only freaky thing was the little kid. He was definitely a piece of work and needed therapy even before viewing the videotape.I think my brother, who joined me in heckling the film (and he is a horror film lover) summed it up best when he said: \"I guess the point of the movie is VHS is evil so watch DVDs.\" *Thumbs WAY Down*'\n",

            "Review: 'I watched the original Japanese \"Ring\" (aka \"Ringu,\" as per the Japanese phonetic) two years ago.  It was a very freaky film, to say the least. So when I learned that a remake of the film was being released here in the States, I had to see it.  I was curious to know if the American filmmakers were going to improve upon the original, or totally screw it up by \"Americanizing\" it.Well, I'm glad to say that they mostly succeeded.  After the opening sequence which was a virtual carbon copy of the Japanese original, the movie improved upon the original in many ways.  There were some plot changes, but most had to do with Americanizing the characters, their relations, and their background.  The writers did a great job of only Americanizing the setting while keeping the core plot elements and themes intact.  (Personally, I really enjoyed the Seattle apartment complex which Naomi Watt's character lives in because the buildings looked decidedly more Japanese than American. :D )  Furthermore, there were some additional scenes and freaky stuff that I don't remember seeing in the Japanese original.  Those new stuff and the Hollywood production value did a good job of improving the movie.  The acting was pretty good too.  Definitely more compelling than the Japanese version, IMHO.Unfortunately, I was let down by the climactic ending of the movie. Naturally, I will not spoil the movie for you by going into details.  But let me just say that I found the Japanese ending to be ten times more freaky (and memorable!) than the American one.  In terms of the plot, the endings are practically the same, but how the scene was executed was different. I feel that the Japanese ending was more tightly directed and more freaky as a result, compared to the slightly self-indulgent \"ooh, isn't this scary\" American rendition of the same scene.But apparently, I felt that way only because I had watched the original. There were plenty of girls screaming and guys yelling \"Holy $#!+\" in the theater, and my cousin (who had not watched the Japanese original) was very freaked out too.  I was definitely among the minority.All in all, I think \"The Ring\" is a great remake of the Japanese original. Even though I personally feel that they somewhat botched the ending (probably only because I'm comparing it to the Japanese original, which most people probably haven't even heard of anyways), the American version successfully brings the feel of the Japanese occult and horror to the American moviegoers.  It definitely ain't your usual hack-and-slash cheese-and-sleaze gore-horror flick.  It's a great, great movie for the Halloween season, and I expect it to enjoy a long, happy life at the box office.Oh, as a side note, while watching David Letterman the other night, I learned that Naomi Watts (the leading actress) went to the same high school with Nicole Kidman in Australia.  Maybe that's why Naomi has same facial expression things going on as Nicole.  I thought it was very interesting. I wonder if I'm the only one who saw that.  :)'\n",

Therefore, if you see the mike in a movie (unless, I mean, it comes halfway down the screen or something), it's the fault of the person up in that little box behind you, OK?  Glad I got that out; that really p****d me off...OK, now as for the review.  Like I said in the one line summary, I am not easily scared.  Exorcist didn't scare me.  Silence of the Lambs only scared me in that one scene in the car, which you could probably compare this whole movie to.  I went to this movie expecting to jump a little bit and have fun with my friends.  Oh, was I ever wrong.  My friend, Amy, and I walked in and noticed, \"Hey, cool, there are only four other people in here!\"  Trouble is, they left right after the movie started.  During the movie, my eyes were glued to the screen.  Amy and I kept telling each other, \"I'm watching, you have to watch, don't cover your eyes!\"  The whole thing was so amazingly mind-boggling.  This comes from someone whose favorite movies are Quills, Memento, and Magnolia, so believe me when I tell you.  If you complained about the, \"plot holes,\" you didn't watch it right.  The fear of the unknown is what it's all about.  Also, people that complained about the acting didn't watch the same movie I did.  These actors were so incredibly real that I felt like I was watching something taped from real life.  Yes, the movie did go for a few easy scares, but it also made /fun/ of them too.You know in ever horror movie, when people creep up behind someone sitting in a chair, and they spin it around to show somebody with their eyes gouged out or something?  This was a running inside joke throughout the whole movie.  There are tons of those.  Anyway, when the movie ended, we planned to sit through the credits like we always do.  This movie, however, was so freaking scary that we just wanted to leave.  The problem was, our shoes were on the floor and we were afraid to reach down and get them.  So we sat. In the dark.  Until this horrible, loud agonizing music came on and we started /squealing/!  It was awful!  You know how when you want to watch the credits to a movie, they always turn the lights on and ruin it?  Our person wouldn't turn the lights on, and Amy and I were frozen in our chairs. Finally, we RAN out of the theater and Amy slammed the door and we sat hyperventilating in the bathroom.  The guy that saw us run out didn't even look surprised:  I suppose a lot of people reacted that way.  Suddenly, I realized:  I'd left my purse in the theater.  Amy wouldn't even come back in with me, so I had to ask this total stranger to come in.  And I reiterate /very strongly/, I don't get scared easily at all.  I recommend this movie if you're in a good mood and you have a really good friend to clutch onto, or a boyfriend.  And please DON'T talk, OK?  That just p****s people off...my other friend saw it and didn't get scared at all because there were people giggling through the whole thing and making out.  *sighs*  Anyway, go see it.  You /won't/ believe your eyes. ~*~ FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAW IT - SPOILERS! ~*~ I don't know about you guys, but wasn't the girl's room in the barn totally creepy?  That was one of the things that creeped me out the most.  Also, some running themes I noticed throughout the movie:*seeing people sitting from behind, like I already mentioned, *fire! *rings...seriously, look, they're everywhere, and they keep flashing them in between frames!  Very scary... *horses...OK, I know, duh, but it's surprising how /many/ you see.'\n",

Anyway the film's kind of dark, don't expect to leave it in the theatre it goes home with you for a while!ja,ja.(not joking). It is really intense! ** Spoilers ahead ** it starts  with this girl who dies after seen a strange videotape with rough images and a doomed call the minute after seeing it!! There's where reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) starts investigating the strange death, she founds the tape and right after she sees it the phone rang and behind the misterious call a voice of a child saying \"seven days\" wich is the time of life she  have left after seeing this tape. So then Rachel must hurry to find out what's it all about along with Noah (Martin Henderson) who also sees the tape a day after Rachel. The mistery clears up little by little and nothing's what it seems believe me, there's even a time when you think its ending hollywood style, but the really scary stuff is yet comming!! I must say i liked the film  it's very original, but pay much attention because the plot doesn't give everything directly away, some people whom had seen it stays with plot holes, may be 'cause of the state of fright they're in the moment.

            "Review: 'After recently seeing The Ring, it is not since The Blair Witch Project that I have been scared and freaked out so much by a horror film. After the endless array of horror films that rely on people bumping into each other or the use of orchestral blastings after a period of silence, The Ring creates one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences ever and having none of the latter cheap scare devices.After just seeing the Japanese version, there are few differences between the two but as a gasp to many other horror fans, I do prefer the US version. I thought the screenplay was more in depth and the changes and additions writer Ehren Kruger composed, really added an edge to the original story of The Ring. Although the well scenes were more chilling in the Japanese version, The Ring was a film which really needed a bigger budget and more polished visuals to suck the most juice of of the story's great potential and the US version perfected it without ruining it with the usual loudness, gloss and insubtlety.Never seeing director Gore Verbinsky's previous work, i was extremely impressed. After the 'Scream' influenced opening, I'd have to say it had me on the edge of my seat more than the 3 Scream films combined. His use of little music, unnerving sound effects and the splashes of stylish transitions and shots were very beneficial to create the extremely creepy atmosphere. Along with the help of cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, The film features a very dull and overcast look which in such scenes as the horse sequence, add elements of mystique and coldness.Overall The Ring is an excellent film that creates the atmosphere and genuine scares that horror films have lacked for years. With various complaints of plot holes and seldom explanations for plotlines, it IS a horror film, there will always be plotholes to make the film more entertaining and if people always need plots spoonfed to them, wait for the next wave of Summer blockbusters in 2003. With the jawdropping ending, accomplished acting, It provides a twisting and chilling experience that many of us have waited for in a horror film for a long time.'\n",

I had very low expectations for this film, and after the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought the my expectations would be proved wrong. The movie got off to a very spooky start, and then just grasped at straws for the remainder of the film. The movie starts off with two teenage girls talking about this video that kills you when you watch it, and true to horror movie form, one of them is doomed. It was a spooky setup and I was starting to look forward to seeing the rest of the film. . .only to be brought back down to my original expectations. The movie continues on from this point to follow Naomi Watts' character around as she investigates the tape. She follows all her clues, and asks a million and one questions about the tape, and those involved in the making of the tape, and then the movie ends without answering any of the questions. It really is a shame. It is the success of this film that has sent the horror movie genre on the lame downward spiral of PG-13 ghost movie after PG-13 ghost movie, and the movie was absolutely pointless, and not scary.

And that's amazing, considering I'd already seen the original Japanese movie it's based on, RINGU, and pretty much knew what was going to happen all through the film and was still on the edge of my seat.  The screenplay by Ehren Kruger manages to faithfully retell the original film's story but add just enough new twists to keep you guessing.The story follows reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) on the trail of an urban legend about a cursed videotape.  Apparently, as soon as you finish watching the tape, your telephone rings and a whispered voice tells you that you have seven days to live; and at the end of seven days, you die.  Rachel is drawn into the mystery of the tape when her sixteen-year-old cousin drops dead, apparently a victim of the curse.Pretty soon Rachel finds the tape itself, and, being the reporter she is, she watches it and, sure enough the phone rings... and suddenly she believes.It's incredible how much more suspenseful this film is than the original, considering that it follows the same basic outline.  One way it does this is by adding new texture to each scene; what was eerie in the first film is absolutely frightening in this one.  And director Gore Verbinski's visual style keeps the tension building, with an almost total lack of humor (which is interesting in and of itself, considering all of his previous films have been comedies).To sum it all up, this is an amazing film you do NOT want to watch alone!'\n",

It has some twist about a video tape that kills people. It's edgy and uses those nifty effects that horror directors use these days to make things seem creepy.I suppose the thing I expected most out of \"The Ring\" was to be scared. Or at least, recognize an attempt to frighten the audience. Sadly, too much of the film relies on BIG LOUD BURSTS OF SOUND to cause the audience to jump. In the theatre I was in, this was the most common way that the audience got \"scared\" and that's a real s****y sign in a horror movie. The overall \"scary\" plot wasn't bad, but ultimately didn't hit home as being anything special, even though the director desperately wanted it to be.The film stars Naomi Watts as the young, less-perky-than-in-Mullholand-Drive investigative reporter who decides to follow up on a rumor/legend after her niece dies. The film gets a little unclear at this point, partly to keep the audience guessing but also I suspect because the writer didn't have a clear idea of where he wanted to go with the plot. Watts discovers that her niece and three other teens watched a video tape and all died seven days later. While her niece was found in a weird mummified state following a sudden heart stoppage, the other teens had died in a car crash and committed suicide. The ways they die aren't really thought of as important however, because we know that it was really watching the tape that killed them.Watts tracks down the tape and promptly watches it. The tape was supposed to be disturbing, but I found myself wondering how much they paid David Lynch to use part of Eraserhead. Watts gets a phone call telling her that she only has seven days left. She then discovers that her face won't appear right on film. Freaked out, she promptly shows the tape to her son's father, then leaves a copy laying around so her son can see it too. Spooked but determined to use her investigative skills to track down a solution to her mess, she digs deeper into the mystery of the tape and why it kills people. This leads Watts on a merry chase through Pacific Northwest charm until she discovers that a young girl was drowned by her mother in a well and that by diving in and holding her as she crumbles the \"curse\" is lifted. Everyone is happy. except this was all just a big bait and switch, and now the dead girl is free to run amuck and kills her boyfriend. Luckily, Watts doesn't have to worry about getting killed because she made a copy of the tape and showed it to someone else, thus lifting the curse from her.Of course, this makes little sense. Burn marks appear on her arm. She is still having problems with bleeding noses and ears and other strange things. Presumably she should have been free from the \"curse\" the second she made a copy of the tape and showed it to someone else. But, whatever. Horror films aren't keen on logic, and this one is no exception. which is a shame since it wanted to be more unique. But ultimately the film relies on the standard horror elements to see it through:* Loud jarring music to spook the audience * Creepy looking kids * Girl in distress and various states of undress * Twist endingWatching the film may give you the impression that you've seen it before. You have. The film is a remake, and the original (\"Ringu\") is far spookier. This DreamWorks adaptation isn't quite the bomb that \"The Haunting\" was, but it is a pale copy of the original. Part of the key of making a good horror film is getting the audience to care about the characters getting axed. In this case, you just don't care and wait for the inevitable gore to take place. When the film (rated PG-13) doesn't bother delivering even that...'\n",

If you want a good scare, I suggest horror films like \"The Omen\", \"Suspiria\", \"Rosemary's Baby\", and \"The Changeling\". \"The Ring\" isn't a patch on these horror classics.\"The Ring\" is obviously a remake of a 1998 Japanese film called \"Ringu\", which is a much better and scarier version.

Thus, to me, this movie draws comparison to the equally-dreadful, boring and inane \"Blair Witch Project\".My neurotic and droll mind actually thought that DreamWorks' marketing funds generated (a) the good buzz on this movie from the starving media, (b) the bad buzz from the media on \"Abandon\" (another inane thriller movie which opened at the same time as \"The Ring\" on 10/18/02) (Translation:  No marketing funds from Paramount), and (c) the phony squeals, screams and applause from the Saturday night audience at Loews Cinema at Universal City in Los Angeles.In the end, it's all about money and good old-fashioned ballyhoo. DreamWorks produced another profitable movie that the public wants.  No argument there.  But for the media to say and the adoring public to start believing that \"The Ring\" is an intelligent and a genuine horror movie, now, that's a lot of croak.'\n",

            "Review: 'I have never known an original to be less of a movie than the remake but in this case I have to give it to Gore Verbinski for keeping the tone of the original in-tact but amplifying the chills a few notches. I was disappointed with the original (I tried very hard to like it) although the tone was decidedly creepy. The remake really delivers. It is everything a scary chiller movie is supposed to be (including plot holes and far fetched premise). The story line of how the girl came to be so evil was nastier in the original (but why did they switch from the father being the culprit in the original to the mother in the remake??) but the tale around how the tape came into existence was more plausible in The Ring. It gave me the creeps throughout without resorting to gore or special effects. Also,I thought that the character development of Rachel was very cleverly done and more developed. You were meant not to care for her parenting skills in the beginning as it gave the chance for her to redeem herself as a parent when the father did not. Naomi Watts character was certainly flawed and this added to yourself being drawn into the movie. Cardboard cutouts never do well in this type of movie.  The role of the son was more prominent in this one which was no bad thing although 6th sense comparisons are inevitable.All in all I would suggest to see both the original and then the remake and make up your own mind. I actually think they compliment one another. I certainly think more of the original now then I did before. This is maybe because I saw it in a more 'western' context and it filled in a lot of unanswered questions I had before I saw the remake.'\n",

I had high hopes for \"Mothman Prophecies,\" but left the theatre feeling as if I had just been pickpocketed.  I didn't go into \"The Ring\" with very high expectations.\"The Ring\" begins like a number of other movies.  Teenage girls, alone in a house, rehashing horror stories and urban legends.  Ten minutes into the movie, I was wondering if this was yet another horror/slasher (\"I know what you did...\" genre).  Thirty minutes later, I felt like I was actually watching a movie that a director, writer, and cast actually *cared* about. It went from horror/\"slasher\" to a rather unique story around a cliche urban legend.Daveigh Chase was unrecognizeable as Samara.  Ms. Chase is typically the \"cute, Disney girl\" (\"Lilo & Stitch\",\"Spirited Away\").  In \"The Ring,\" she is truly otherworldly.  Her acting gave me goosebumps. Naimi Watts and Martin Henderson were both very good in their roles.  They seemed to be real, everyday, people who were caught up in a bizarre horror/mystery.I'd recommend \"The Ring\" to others.  It might not be a movie you'd see again and again, but it will leave you scared and thinking about your fears. That's more than I can say about most modern horror movies.'\n",

I saw this film in a crowded theater in Times Square on Halloween; at many points during the film the audience wasn't sure whether to be frightened or just laugh (I am aware this can be a defense mechanism against feelings of fright, however some of the plot is truly laughable). The film also leaves many unanswered questions. The ending (the best part of the film) goes on too long trying to tie all these loose ends, and eventually I stopped caring. Some on this board have said this is the scariest film they have seen in years. Perhaps the horror genre doesn't work for me much anymore, but I just wasn't very frightened. The setup of The Ring seems to promise chills galore, but I found them to be few and far between. This is a better horror film than most made these days (that's not saying much), but could have been a lot better. The Ring would make a good DVD or VHS tape rental (no pun intended).'\n",

It wasn't great - at least, not in the same way as a perfect movie like The Sixth Sense, to which this film owes some debt, such as in the creepy-boy-harbingering-evil-spirits department. It was jumbled and contained some story threads that had you analyzing whether the plot truly made sense, or whether it was a product of kitchen-sink horror-moviemaking. And sometimes, you feel a bit like Atlas trying to keep all your disbelief suspended. Like when that creepy midget-boy is talking, and you can't decide whether to be creeped out, or whether the makeup artist should be censured for having put way too much purple blush around his eyes. Still, at its core this is a scary flick which I'm glad I saw. Especially enthralling is the videotape which, according to the plot of the film, causes you to die if you watch it. Modeled after early 20th Century Surrealist films, it definitely grabs. It kinda makes you wish the whole movie were filmed like that.'\n",

When I learned that there was going to be an American re-make, I immediately wanted to see it.  But, having read that the Japanese version is a great horror movie, I wanted to see the original first. So, I did.  And I was blown away.  The movie was almost perfect.  It was scary, had a genius plot, good direction, and a spectacular ending.  I went to see the \"The Ring\" on opening night, keeping in mind that some said it stayed true to the original.  The opening scene was like the original, but then the movie heads off into something else. The screenplay for the U.S. version was terrible.  They should've stayed along the lines of the original.  I really do not like how the U.S. version had to explain everything, it left nothing to the imagination.  Movies are much more frightening when the viewer has to imagine what happened, rather than throwing it right in their face.  The Japanese version made the perfect setting, and it just gave that dark, eery, suspenseful feeling.  \"The Ring\" Americanized the original, with cheap scares and typical \"american suspense.\" Although the re-make was better than recent horror, it does not live up to original, and it threw too much different ideas in, i.e. horses, Samara's father, the extensive footage of the cursed video tape.  If you want to see a true horror movie, watch \"Ringu\", and try thinking for yourself.'\n",

The \"barn door\" is left gaping open for part two at the end.Rule #2- leave the kids at home unless you want to cough up for expensive therapy bills and remove your tv and phone from your house.I am a big fan of horror films, and \"The Ring\" just about pushed me over the threshold of what I can stand in terms of scariness (still not sure if this is a good or bad thing). This is a beautiful, haunting, stylized and permanently mind-altering film.As I sat in the theater, I was struck by the thought that \"The Ring\" will become this generation's \"Psycho\" or \"Poltergeist.\" This film is no mere horror movie. \"The Ring\" embraces its forefathers of the genre, then proceeds to spin it's own near-therapy-inducing post-modern chills. One of the characters asks \"Where does your mom keep her Vicodin?\" You will be wishing you had some too after the first freaky, wicked-creepy flash of disturbing imagery.What \"Psycho\" did for showers, \"The Ring\" does for tv's, (with a concious nod to \"Poltergeist\") vcr's, log cabins, forests, phones - you name it. Like Hitchcock, (note the homage to \"Psycho\" in Rachel's shower scene)the film does not derive its terror from gore or thrill kill - but rather through a painstakingly deliberate unfolding and revealing. \"The Ring\" was at times so dramatically tense and creepy, you felt you needed a break, but the director shows no mercy. (Yeah, and director-dude, thanks for all those \"false scares,\" I really needed those in addition to all the other trauma).There is much to praise about \"The Ring,\" and it seems destined to become both a block buster and a cinephile's cult favorite. The film craft is excellent - stunning visuals, spot-on music and atmospheric noise, good script, good acting and masterful direction. \"The Ring\" is elevated above the typical genre film.The myriad of meta-narrative and meta-cinematic elements only add to the meat of this film. Point 1- we are watching a movie about people watching a movie that kills them (and just wait till the home video! Try putting that in your VCR a second time). At numerous points in the film, it posits, and you think to yourself - will we the viewer die too, having seen \"the tape??\"Also, interestingly, we mirror Rachel - we want to \"show\" people \"the tape\" (aka \"The Ring\"), but we don't want to \"kill them\" with being freaked out and emotionally scarred. We also mirror her process of discovery as we look back and try to piece the film together - I see flashes of the movie as concepts click into my comprehension.The film does not explain everything, and to fault it for that I believe misses the point. There is much to ponder and discuss. You will want to see the originals, and simultaneously not want any more of those images in your head.See it, but only if you want to carry Samara (is this a gloss for Samsara??) in your head forever.'\n",

With the special effects in this one, it was way over done.I guess when it comes down to it, it really depends on which one you watch first... if you see this one first before the original, you might like this one better. \"Thriller/horror\" like this is all about first time watching, when you least expect something to happen. I will say this however: part of the problem with this remake compared to the original is that it tries too hard to explain everything (typical for western audience, where everything must be explained and addressed), part of the thing that did it for me in the original one was that it started mysteriously, and ended mysteriously.Anyways, I just didn't like it...

            "Review: '*Possible spoilers* What can one truly say about the Ring?  On the one hand it was frustrating.  The relationship between the Samara, Aiden and Rachel is not explained well.  Why did Samara choose to speak to Aiden?  Why was it important for Rachel to pull the remains of Aiden from the well?  Why does Noah get whacked?  After all, he helped solve the mystery. I would think he would be on the inner track with Samara.  And why does Rachel make copies of the tape for distribution?  There is no indication that she is compelled to do this.  The whole thing is not explained well enough in my view.  I understand that we want to leave some of this to our own interpretations but there is always the possibility that by leaving too much we become frustrated.  This film comes very close to that line.On the other hand it was disturbing.  I have to admit that as I went to bed after watching it I had a far-fetched tiny little fear that my TV set might suddenly pop on.  If it had, I guarantee that I would they probably would have found me in the morning with that same twisted look of fear on my face as the people in the film.  It was disturbing enough for me that it was just a little bit harder to feel completely comfortable in the dark. The whole sequence where Samara comes out of the well and walks towards the `camera' is totally creepy by any interpretation.   If the goal was to leave images in the mind that continue to creep you out for days after you saw the film, then the filmmakers succeeded in that respect.  I think for that reason you can forget about the frustration and have a good time with this one.'\n",

            "Review: 'Coming from the Steven Spielberg stable Dreamworks, this surprisingly respectful remake of Ring is an excellent horror thriller in its own right. The Ring manages to pay respect to the original and use its ideas, but often chooses to interpret various scenes its own way.To say it lives up to Nakata Hideo's near perfect original, would be a mistake, but The Ring is just about there. Starring Muholland Drive's Naomi Watts, written by Scream 3 scribe Ehren Kruger, and directed by Pirates of the Caribbean's Gore Verbinski, the signs weren't good. To top all of that off, they were making an unnecessary remake of an acclaimed masterpiece.However, The Ring was the surprise success of 2002/03, due to a clever and dramatic advertising campaign (see left). The tagline `Before you die, you see' was a temptation to audiences and The Ring ended up as the scariest movie since the original. It made a star of Naomi Watts, and of director Gore Verbinski, and Scream 3 writer Ehren Kruger.The plot focuses on the mystery of a nightmarish videotape which kills you one week after you watch it. Cynical journalist Rachel Keller (Watts) soon gets drawn into the mystery after her niece and 3 of her friends all die inexplicably on the same night, in different places. Soon, she finds the tape for herself and watches it, and then the phone rings. Later she enlists help from her ex-boyfriend, who also watches it. However, after her inexplicably  paranormal son watches the tape also; she is drawn further into a bizarre mystery which somehow involves horses, a suicidal parent and a very deep well.The Ring shows an intricate attention to every detail. The setting itself is filled with clues (for example ring shapes in the background), and every place is dripping with dread and atmosphere. The whole film has a dark blue-green tinted feel, which reflects the surreal video, and the stark contrasts in some scenes make the scene where big revelations happen seem more realistic. In fact all of Bojan Bazelli's dreamlike cinematography is a wonder to behold. Hans Zimmer's surreal, swelling score is beautiful and dramatic, but never intrusive. The on-screen countdown adds to the sense of urgency, and Ehren Kruger's (who wrote the distinctly average Scream 3) clever and inventive script adds emotion to a story which seemed bland originally due to the all too literal TartanAsia subtitles.\n",
            "The Ring strives to work on as many levels as Ring did. The ghost story seemed much more in place in the Land of the Rising Sun, than the land of baseball and leaders with below par IQs. There is no longer a sense of unpredictable dislocation as the Japanese version had, and the less said about the reimagining of Nakata's frightening final scene, he better.However where The Ring improves, is in the way that everything that is happening is more dramatic and exciting. The killer video is much more creepy and bizarre, and the struggle of Rachel is made more sympathetic as she leaves her comfortable Seattle home into a dislocated windswept village far away from help. The scene in the well is much scarier, and the opening possesses far more tension than Nakata's original. The Ring also leaves many questions unanswered, but enough actually answered to work as a stand alone horror movie. Whether The Ring can survive as a franchise remains to be seen (The Ring 2 is already in production) but as a horror on its own, it is creepy and imaginative enough in its own way, and remains almost as disturbing as the original.Verdict: Far better than all the 21st century Hollywood horror movies put together, and a pretty tough rival to Nakata Hideo's original, The Ring is a frightening and memorable horror picture. ****'\n",

I cannot spell it in Hebrew here, for, that would be counted as incorrect spelling which wont go through in this forum system.But, the \"lost word\" in an ancient language adds up to 61, and the number of the apartment is 601, the 6, 0 the ring, and then the 1. The same word is the (wont go through) word for well, ring, eye, and nothingness.This same sound was the meditation sound used by a meditation system popular in the Sixties. Only sincere looking members were given this \"lost word\". By meditating on this sound you experience a taste of nothingness, which is very refreshing. It is the heart of every pleasure. The Oriental radical for heart is the serial number 61 radical.The name of this movie is \"The Ring\", the well was important in the story, the girl, 12 years old at the time, had her long black hair covering one eye, and revealing the other one eye.The girl's name, I don't even think the girl's name would pass through this spelling sensor, the girl's name means \"a guardian\" in (wont pass); but, this movie originated in (wont pass), and the (wont pass) name for it means \"Happy Apple Horse\".

Fast entropy production rates bend time space globally leaving the rigid orthogonality of flat time space behind so that all that involved gets a tenuously indistinguishable from that which is called \"spirit\".In such a field the body is able to snap back to its original health template, curing disease, and even renewing youth.

It will go down as one of the most haunting and complex scores of his career. But besides the music and a few effective scenes the movie has nothing going for it.Naomi Watts, who can be a brilliant actress when in the hands of the right director(like David Lynch), is awful in this movie. She, along with most of the cast, consistently delivers her lines as if she were reading them off a teleprompter. Watts exhibits the same kind of artificiality that was necessary for her character in \"Mulholland Drive\", but here it is just embarrassing and it comes across as a terrible performance.Gore Verbinski, who shows potential as a filmmaker with a few well-directed scenes, based this film on the Japanese horror movie with the same title. The original movie, in and of itself, was a rip-off of the 1980 classic \"The Changeling\" with George C. Scott. It is incredibly vexatious when you sit there in the theatre waiting for the pay-off and it turns out to be the pay-off from another movie.Like I said before, most of the acting is atrocious, with the exception of Brian Cox's cameo. It is impossible for a bad movie to bring down this amazing actor. In fact, the two scenes involving Brian Cox are the most effective and frightening moments in the movie. Every other scene intended to be scary was laughable. The scares could be spotted a mile away.With \"The Ring\" Verbinski wanted to make a rich, psychologically disturbing horror film along the same lines as \"The Tenant\" and other great films that are better than this movie. Instead what we get is a film that wants to be something that it cannot be due to a flawed screenplay and bad performances. Not to mention that for anyone who has seen \"The Changeling\" this movie will be recycled material anyway.'\n",

            "Review: 'The Ring had a chilling concept and much potential.The Concept:  A tape, filled with seemingly random and meaningless bits and peices of footage, is deadly.  Once one watches it, they immediately recieve a phone call, with a voice that simply says, \"Seven Days.\"  Seven days after this phone call, you die.  In what fashion do you die? How do you die? Who's behind it? Who kills you? How can anyone detect when you are watching a videotape? Etc.., are many of the hundreds of questions you will be asking while you watch this movie.  The problem? By the time the credits have finished at the end of the movie, you still have many more questions than answers.  And the answers you have don't make much sense, and don't satisfy at all.This movie also does not deliver as many say or said it would in the are of being \"scary\" or a \"horror.\"  All of the shocks and scares of the movie are in the style of the Sixth Sense.  Something scary doesn't necessarily happen, it just happens very quickly and loudly, and right in your face, usually proceeded by a silent build up.  There are a couple of those types of scares in this movie. Most, however, come by anticipation. Most hear so much about how \"freaky\" and/or \"scary\" this movie is, so they watch on the edge of their seats waiting for a scare, and a lot of the time a quiet scene is followed by something very loud happening in the next scene, something that is not scary at all.I give this movie ** out of ****, because it did have an entertaining idea, and wasn't total crap.'\n",

The part that gets me the worst is not the concept of dying or how the folks died, but the loud noises and ominous music that the producers placed at every single scene transition.  By far, the best movie I've seen this year.

How does one look all moldy and bleedy when you're heart just stops?  And second, the questiond I yelled aloud at the end of the movie, \"Who made the tape?\"  If you by any chance wrote 'The Ring', and know, please tell us!  Some would say the father made the tape, which is logical, but the concept you should have got was: the girl wanted her message to be heard.  So that rules out the dad, but still, how do you make a tape when you're stuck in a well? ***END SPOILER****But seriously folks, go see it.  More importantly, go see it with someone.

It's extremely hard to produce a horror movie that shows intelligence, scares you, and is not cheesy.  I believe the Ring did as good of a job as possible.Possible Spoilers...The plot sounds stupid from the outside but it's actually pretty clever. You gradually see the importance of the video tape and the character's roles as the movie progresses. Naomi Watts was impressive and I think David Dorfman (Aidan) could have a bright future. At the beginning, I was afraid Aidan would be just like Haley Joel Osment from the Sixth Sense. Pleasantly, they didn't overuse Aidan's part and it worked well.The movie wasn't that scary, but the way the movie draws you in adds to the scare. The scene where Samara comes out of the t.v. was relatively disturbing. I can only name a handful of horror movies that really impressed me and The Ring is one of them.3.5 out of 4.

So perhaps my view on this picture will be a tad more objective 'cos I won't compare it to Ringu.-might contain spoilers (and a lot of typo's)-Either way, i heard a lot of good things about this movie, so with high expectations I decided to watch it on a dark, cold winter night. The movie starts with two teens on the bed, talking bout this urban legend. My first impression was: oh god, not again. Now a killer with a mask will jump from behind the curtains and stab them both to death, right? Well..no!From the beginning there's this eery atmosphere and with a few (cheap) tricks the tension starts to rise till the end of this intro which leaves us with a riddle of what exactly happened. I almost pissed my pants after this first scene so the intro really set the mood.The story continues at a comfortable pace. Nothing drastic happens, but there's this constant creepy atmosphere and simple things like that red tree at the cabin, the bleeding noses, terrific camera-angles and loud sounds (read: noise) that just make you want to grab a pillow and hold it in front of your eyes.Till the 7th day, I can't tell anything bad or annoying bout this movie. But then they start messing things up. Rachel falls into the well, Samara grabs her hand and Rachel gets this vision of how things went. This part looks great actually, but then Samara comes to the surface. Bad move lads. Till that particular event, 'Samara' was a huge mystery: was samara really evil, how did she look like, etc. But here everything about this mystery goes to waste when Samara floats to the surface in, what seemed to me, a clumsy way.Well, from then on they think everything is solved and the party goes home. If they had ended the film here, that would have been a damn lame ending. So they put on this extra chapter in which the truth becomes clear to Rachel and the poor lad dies in a great scene (remember the fly that left the screen? Wow!) It's a nice turn in the story, but it feels artificial. They could have done a lot better job to add this extra part.Also, there are quite many `what if's like `what if the TV is really small so samara can't  crawl out' or `what if you're in this forest on the 7th with no TVs around you' etc.Despite the mediocre ending, I give this movie 7/10.PS: Nice acting from Naomi Watts'\n",

It's what a really bad movie could be, if it tried.The most annoying being the boom mike in almost every other dialogue scene from the beginning.  It was a constant reminder I was watching a show. I could have watched it in a barn with horses.  Two that stick out prominently in my head are: The entire boom \"arm\", mike and cord in the upper right corner in the scene where Rachel leaves Noah's apt the first time and is standing by the elevator discussing poo-poo drivel.  The other goofy use of the mike is in the scene where Rachel interviews wacko at the insane asylum. Not only can you see the mike you can watch it go back and forth from wacko to Rachel during their talk.    Stink-o. The frames of the solo face shots cut off the chins in a not-art-film way and the love for her son was about a genuine as a frog and a rock.   The up side was the kid was the best part. He was a little creepy but endearing and I appreciated the dull overall color to add to the mood. Otherwise, maybe the \"deleted\" scenes that some say there are would explain the confusing David Lynch attempt they were going for. And for the love of all that is holy how did they or ANYONE miss that mike at the top of the screen. The entire theatre was laughing at it here.

            "Review: 'Has the Sixth Sense stylized horror? A genre scarred by gore in the 80's and self-mockery in the 90's seems to be taking some positive steps towards the Hitchcock masterpieces of the past. Following on from the success of The Sixth Sense and The Others, The Ring backs an intriguing mystery with some genuine scares. Already a massive success in Japan, The Ring's Hollywood makeover has maintained its allure, proving that originality isn't necessarily the key to success.Taking the premise of an urban myth, The Ring centers around a mysterious video than once observed, leaves the viewer with only seven days to live. Watts (Mulholland Dr., Tank Girl) plays Rachel Keller, a investigative journalist seeking to unlock the reason behind her niece's bizarre murder while juggling a emotionally repressed son (Hoffman) and his lethargic father (Henderson) . When she stumbles upon the video, it becomes clear that she now only has seven days to live. Thus begins The Ring.To disperse more of the plot would jeopardize a brilliant and well told succession of twists, turns and frights. The Ring is genuinely scary, working your sub-conscience into a frenzy of anticipation that keeps an otherwise quiet middle from bogging down the film. Director Verbinski (The Mexican , Mouse Hunt) is in complete control, choosing his scares with unpredictability and providing some magnificently atmospheric eye candy.The performances are excellent. Watts (looking scarily like a blonde Nicole Kidman) and Henderson (Windtalkers) are believable in their fears as the threat of the unknown drives at their splintered family. A good show from the supporting cast is only dented by Hoffman, who, despite looking spooky, comes in several shades down from the peerless Haley Joel Osment in a performance clearly inspired by the seminal child actor of his generation.Horror films have definitely made a positive leap in the last few years and despite some Hollywoodised death scenes, The Ring is a dead set bed wetter. Hard to predict, rarely does the tension let up and the ending is one of the genre's greatest leaving you, at the credits, legitimately fearful of your immediate future. Take a friend and go see.'\n",

And the opening scene in Ghost Story was far more riviting than the one in The Ring in which just a well was shone.

Unfortunately the film makes absolutely no sense and isn't scary in the least -- unless you're frightened by images reminiscent of some old Nine Inch Nails video.I can't figure out why a great actress like Naomi Watts would do a film like this after her success with Mulholland Drive. Maybe they offered her a lot of money? I guess.The movie is terrible -- completely stupid. You want an example? A little girl is suffocated by her mother in the early 1950s using a plastic trash bag. Uh, like they had Glad Bags back then? And that's a small goof in a film full of them, though I won't mention any more here.Don't waste your time or money on this. Wait till it shows up on the SciFi channel or someplace like that to check it out.'\n",

            "Review: 'To get it out of the way: a killer videotape is objectively, a little ridiculous, and on the surface not a very frightening idea at all. For skeptics, especially horror skeptics, it would be tempting to write the film off for this reason alone. I would seriously urge you not to.What makes this film so effective is that it utilises atmosphere to entertain fear. The audience is not subject to regular, predictable jump scares. There isn't a character dying every 15 minutes. Yet you are kept in a permanent, undulating state of tension throughout because of how cleverly the film has set everything up.It achieves this in a variety of ways: the ever-present blue filter, the near-absence of music, the intertitle cards for each day of the week, progressively pulling us closer and closer to... we don't even know for sure. And last, the opening -- this is something a lot of horror films try to do, but in the majority of cases fail to execute as well: open the film with an incredibly suspenseful and ultimately terrifying 10 minutes, as way of locking the audience into a state of fear -- a state where the movie has showed them what it can do, and what do expect. A brilliant and sparingly used jump-scare is also delivered at the start, but rather than being predictable, it comes out of nowhere.What effect does this have? For the rest of the film, you are afraid of what'll happen next. The film barely needs to do anything at all, it only needs to suggest 'enough' -- you, the audience member, will create the fear for yourself. For instance, by virtue of the original jump scare coming out of nowhere, the audience is on constant alert for one even when the film doesn't look like it is leading there.In other words, this film very successfully adopts the 'less is more'. We get scared in the dark not because the dark is actively scaring us, but because our brains are projecting frightening thoughts onto it -- The Ring operates in the same way.---------------A point of contention: this vs the original. It seems that people generally prefer the version they see first. I personally think this is a rare case of the remake surpassing the original. The remake is more polished and controlled. Some will say this absence of grittiness lessens the scare, I disagree. To me the difference here is like one between a student film and a professional remake of the same thing. Mostly comes down to taste though, and which you saw first.'\n",

            "Review: 'Beware, thar be SPOILERS ahead.I enjoyed most of the film, and it has made me think about it past having seen it, so I think that is automatically a good sign.  But knowing nothing about the original Ringu or the apparent fact that this was based on a book, it was obvious there was something missing from The Ring.  I thought most of what they kept in the movie was cleverly done, but the fact that apparently this evil child is the result of an unholy union between her mother and, in Ringu (from what I have been able to read), the sea (which has its own unholy interpretation in Japanese mythology) I had to look up on discussion sites.  I think that adds an interesting twist, also tying her spirit more closely to the water.  Okay, so I am sucker for motif.But what baffles me in the end is wondering if Samara is actually evil or just the result of evil.  There seemed to be plenty of evidence in the film that she is a manifestation of evil, but perhaps not evil herself.  She knows that she is hurting people, she tells the doctor.  She is sorry, but she can't stop.  She can make images and videotapes and wants to be heard. The result of hearing her story is feeling her pain.  Is that the curse she had in life that led to her being murdered?  And then, after being murdered, she still wants to be heard, and her message now leads people to share the pain of her death.  In this way, Samara really is sorry for what happens, but she is unable to be a normal child and bad things simply happens when she tries to be.  As a child needs to share, she is sharing all she has.  In this case, it is pain and death.  So is she sparing Rachel, or is it just that Rachel has shared her pain and doesn't require Samara to manifest herself to her?  The other victims know nothing else of Samara.  Even Noah, who learned everything Rachel did, was still spared from being in the well and truly understanding (\"How long could you survive like that?\"  \"Seven Days.\"  He still misses what Samara is trying to share).  Is *this* actually what spares Rachel?  I am missing something of the symbolism here, probably due more to my own limited scrying ability than evidentiary lack.Okay, so some rambling is going on.  I am not trying to explain things, but pointing out that some more background on the child would have been only enlightening.  The movie has the feel of Hollywood jumping to the conclusion that the audience will get bored if the movie is any longer and we just haven't had enough of \"The End?\" endings even after suffering through \"The Blob\" as children (well, some of us).  That seemed a little too contrived. That I feel that way makes me think the movie must have been pretty good. But I think a lot could have been elucidated (and still plenty left to ponder) with an additional ten minutes in the film.  But I am one for closure.  If you are not so dependent on it, and enjoy being left to come to your own conclusions, then you might really enjoy this one.Still, someone brought up the point that if Rachel finds a murderer, has her son show him the tape, then does this absolve them of the cycle?  If a pilot and co-pilot view the tape and then exactly seven days later they are flying a bunch of nuns and Rachel and Aiden to China, do they all plunge to their deaths when the pilots die?  Is evil just that random?  Knowing nothing else about the cycle makes you wonder silly things like that.'\n",

So I gave it a few weeks to catch \"The Ring\". Unfortunately my trip was ill timed to correspond with the release of \"8 Mile\" which, with its numerous sellouts, forced the same type of people into a second choice, my first choice \"The Ring\". I enjoyed Verbinski's \"The Mexican\", though I seemed to be in the minority of people who liked it, and now I'm apparently in the minority of people who didn't like this film. I probably suffered from the over hype that many of my friends have given this movie, and went in expecting something creepy, a cross between Sixth Sense and Seven and all the other disturbing movies that stick with you long after the credits roll. However \"The Ring\" is neither of those films, nor is it on the level of \"Urban Legend\" or other schlock spook fests. Instead it falls somewhere in between- an art film trying to make it mainstream. Too bad it failed for me miserably. Emily Watts was very wonderful playing the reporter trying to unravel the puzzle of the videotape of death (which I always thought was \"Showgirls\"). But beyond her performance there was little else for the film to hang its hat on besides some forced eerie footage on the evil tape, and some moody cinematography (which is the only real reason to see the film) with a nice homage to Hitchcock tucked neatly inside. I found the story rather weak, though it didn't completely leave me disinterested (again mainly due to Watts being very alluring). I don't mind a slow paced film either; in fact I rather enjoy it when it adds to the story. However, I thought the pacing was all over the place here. We have a story that should take place over 7 days (or at least the part post-teaser...it did in some respects feel like episodic television after all), yet it's not pace evenly. Either building slowly, with the later days stretching longer, or moving faster to place emphasis on the running out of time would, I think, help.With all this said, I'd still recommend the film for Watts and for the lushness of the cinematography. Beyond that, if you want to see a well crafted narrative that builds suspense without tricks, check out \"Insomnia\" instead.'\n",

Of course the two girls build on skepticism shared by the audience until one of the girls dies--apparently she saw the video seven days ago.From that point, you are taken on a journey of disturbing images, unanswered questions, and unlikely revelations.The protagonist played by the beautiful Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr.), a journalist who was related to the girl who got killed in the beginning of the movie stumbles across evidence about the videotape.  Unfortunately she ends up finding the video and watching it (Dumb idiot).  Ultimately believing that she has 7 days to live, she goes to great lengths to solve the mystery, and we are right behind her.This movie puts evidence and disturbing images in front of you and lets you analyze what they mean and how it pertains to the whole mystery.

The mystery.A mystery is a good description for \"The Ring\". The scary story comes out of the belief that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in seven days. Why? That is what the story is all about. That alone is kind of freaky. Just to think that by watching a video you will die kind of gives one the \"eebie jeebies\".\"The Ring\" doesn't waste time on gore. There are only a couple of moments that there are glimpses of disturbing images. They are on the screen so briefly that it almost acts as a camera giving you a mental picture of what the people looked like after they died. I was surprised though that it only received a PG-13 rating. I really don't recommend to anyone that they allow there 13 year-old to see it. They WILL have nightmares.

Not for its camera work ( tho im a big fan of the over use of the color grey in this movie ) but for its script, both original and spooky in our tv generation the boogieman if u will for the x geners (and about as far off as u can imagine from twin peaks where if you had actualy saw the show or have ever seen any other david lynch movie uses his script to let out angers he has deep down inside him, thus making a tale about a videotape that has a curse from a witch i hardly see relating to bob and the gang from twin peaks .. good try thoo.) If anything this is a knockoff of another genre classic 'VideoDrome' by david chronenberg. In Ring you are taken on the ride from the first frame and you dont feel safe untill you hear everyone let out the big sigh when the credits role. It is a mistake to compare ring to the other crafty thriller 'signs' . 'Signs' was a reawakening of the use of imagination which we lack so much in movies theese days with the over use of special effects. Ring follows in this pattern , but not in the fashion where u realy dont get a good look at the shadow till the end, in ring you have a tape the same everytime u watch it, and thats the point. Ring is an old fashioned movie where u have the same situation thru the whole movie but the more information you get the more creepy it gets. Rebirth to the cool crafty horror movies of old??? I think not, but at least whe have mnight to hold us over. Now if you wana see more than just a movie to zone out to for 2 hours... punch drunk love is for you .. how can he use his camera like that!?!'\n",

I devour books and TV shows featuring ghost stories and can watch an 'Emergency Vets' marathon without flinching. But this movie just about did me in. I covered my eyes during most of the end. At first, I didn't think it wasn't too bad. After the first half hour or so, it became incredibly gruesome. The whole Rachel-puking-her-guts-out thing was just sick. It had the stereo-typical twisted, evil, physco kid that you can find in almost any slasher flick. (Actually, TWO evil, physco kids).My advice: Don't waste your time and money on 'The Ring'. No one should see it unless they have NERVES OF STEEL. 0/10'\n",

The incessantly ringing phone has become a staple of American mainstream horror/thriller films. Do you find a ringing phone scary? If so, this film may be for you.Naomi Watts was not convincing as the odd boy's mother. What mother lets her kid walk alone to school in the pouring rain? She smokes and curses to prove how tough she is. Watts is as tough as Monica Potter. Jodie Foster or Hilary Swank could have done better. They are both credibly tough actresses. Watts is a lightweight girlie girl.Why can't odd child actors just be children instead of spooky miniature adults? Haley Joel Osment was much better in THE SIXTH SENSE.The dark, gloomy atmosphere was straight out of SEVEN. It did not make this film atmospheric. No police were involved because no one but one person seemed to notice people were dying at the same time on the same day. Other people in Seattle would have caught on to this while Watts smoked more cigarettes and used a few more curse words to convince herself she was tough. Why must such a bad film insult the intelligence of its audience is this film's biggest mystery.'\n",

I swear, anyone who calls this the scariest movie ever has not watched the original Japanese production of \"Ring\"(also credited as Ringu).They actually did quite a good job in adapting this Japanese original into an American-setting remake, and they improved the effect with lighting and special effects like only Hollywood can do.However, it doesn't beat the Japanese one, which concentrates more on explaining the story then the occasional Hollywood- movie scare(that we see so often), which they save for the ends parts, but still scare you more that \"the Ring\"'s and leaves an after-scare when you finally realize how spooky the movie really is. Okay, I believe that this movie did explain the story, but was kind of rushing it a bit, since I believe they're not going to have a sequel, whilst \"Ring\" could afford to take it slow, since it was a trilogy, not to mention, it had a prequel.Still, like the original(but doesn't have as much effect), after watching this, you're not going to be scared only in the cinema. This is such an applicable and practical movie, very effective since most everybody has a TV set these days. You won't be sitting too close to your TV for a long time.'\n",

I really think all these actors could be great if they weren't in this movie.It had a shakey plot at best, but still succeeded to be creepy.(especially when Samarra jumped out of the telly). I was upset because everyone treated the little girl unfairly, and no one figures out completely why. And why should anyone care that if anyone should be evil, it's her mother who killed her? How was murdering a child at any time a good thing? It did play out mythology wise like Samarra was a demon or possessed by one, but it never stopped to explain why. And even at that, it does not justify the murder. It doesn't explain how if Samarra was a demon, this automatically means that she can jump through electronics and kill someone.This movie should have ended right when they all went home as a family. It would have been the best ending for everyone. But did they care? No, of course not! IT made no sense. Absolutely none, and you know what? I'm not going to sit through two hours of that ever again to figure out why.\n",

I own both the Ring, and Ringu, and The Ring adds much to the original. After so many disappointing horror films it is good to come across such a fresh approach to what frightens us. The story of a vengeful ghost looking for retribution is just the cover  for the true horror of this film. A couple who refuse to accept nature's, or God's, will that they simply weren't meant to have a child somehow manage a pregnancy. Their offspring, a little girl named Samara, is far more than she appears. An undefined dark force channels itself through her, and infects people and animals with horrible mental images. One has the since that this force is evil itself and, in a truly Lovecraftian sense, if one were to see this evil fully it would be more than the mind could handle, which suggests how this entity kills people through Samara. The movie is eloquently and beautifully directed with gorgeous cinematography and an eerie music score by Hans Zimmer. This next comment is a spoiler, so stop reading here if you have not seen the film.   The most terrifying thing about the film is the knowledge that this darkest evil will not stop, but will infect the world.'\n",

Even though there is minimal gore, this film needs no blood to deliver chills and keep you up at night. The special effects, especially towards the end of the film when Noah is killed, are beautiful, and all the loose ends are tied up, so if something seems like a plot hole, it's guaranteed to make sense by the end. If you like mystery and horror, this combines the best of both worlds. Also, at the beginning of each day of the curse, an on-screen caption reminds you of the day count, increasing the suspense as Rachel races to understand the meaning of the tape before her time runs out. The only complaint I have is that the teenage girls in the beginning aren't the best actresses, but that doesn't even bring down the rating! After this movie, you'll be expecting your own phone to ring with a call saying that your days are (literally) numbered, good if you're looking for a mystery, a scare, or a bit of both.'\n",

This movie had the atmosphere that makes a horror film...this to me goes into that tiny group of great PG horror films such as Poltergeist. Also knowing it was written by Ehren Kruger before I watched it made me a little biased because I despise so many of his works. But he did something right in this movie. It's still full of his little trademarks such as offbeat side characters and weird little metaphors here and there...but it worked this time. Also I think the masterful directing by Gore Verbinski made it a little better than it actually was. But who cares? It was good as hell. The acting was great by one of my favs Naomi Watts...she had the charisma to make her one of my favorite horror film heroines. She just had that classy presence on the screen and it worked wonders for the film. She shined is all I can say. The side characters all do very well...I won't get to into them...they were just pretty good. The antagonist of the film Samara was an interesting and awesome character...such rage and evil inside made her one of the most ruthless villains of all time. The directing was top notch by Verbinski...loved every thing he put into it. Tbe film just had the\"look\" to it that made it classy, scary, and beautiful all at once. The color palette was depressing and soggy...one of my favorite types of settings. SPOILERS: Also to add to its success were many freaky and really interesting scenes such as the horse on the ferry, Rachel's dream of coughing up that thing Samara wore in the hospital, the fly, the awesome Day 1,2,3..... title cards that made us feel the impending doom, interesting camera angles, wonderful use of a red tree against a gray sky, and I could go on and on. It just reminded me of a painting several times throughout. Once again great directing by Gore...no one could of done it better then he did.The writing by Kruger here was surprisingly good despite his usual clichés...but like I stated the clichés work here for some odd reason. I know this wasn't his idea. I know of the original Japanese versions and I have seen them...I'm really just not interested in them as much. Anyway, I know what Kruger added to the original story to make it his own. The writing on the Rachel character was very sharp, funny, and well wrought. She had great lines that made her more than just a standard horror heroine...she had that curiosity and timing just right. Also the characters had a very sharp way of speaking to each other. As with Kruger's other films, the characters sound a little to \"smart ass\" to be quite true. But again it worked here...the mixing of the script with Gore was a perfect match made in Heaven.I'll end this review hoping others out there will enjoy it as well. I know many have. Don't be discouraged because of other films such as The Grudge and the god awful Ring Two...in which Kruger's real skin showed. It is definitely one of the best \"ghost\" stories in years. One thing I can praise Kruger for was the simple line in which Rachel tells her angered boss after he threatens to fire her. It's the perfect introduction into a horror story.HARVEY: You're fired. RACHEL: No I'm not. HARVEY: YES you are. RACHEL: No I'm not...I'm cooking to good a story....then all hell breaks loose.8 out of 10.'\n",

It doesn't show you how people are physically damaged when killed, and so there are so very many ways your mind can perceive based on their corpses. I love this movie, and was straight up terrified. Of course, if your all into gore and don't have an imaginative mind, then this is not for you.The terror of not being able to see your enemy is played up in this, which I like. You never really see Samara, except in the hospital and at the end, but you see her effects, and such things are scary to me. And the sense of lack of time is something that also adds a suspenseful feeling. It's one of those things where you really are hoping and praying for the hero or heroine before time is up. And of course, kudos to the ending. I must say I was not expecting that. And the ending makes you think...or at least...it did until they made a sequel, which I have yet to see but am still disappointed. Of course, I won't give away the ending, but I will tell you that if your mind works like mine, you'll be thinking about the future of Rachel.On the downside, the beginning was fudged up.

But this was my introduction to horror, so I suppose that's why I'm happy looking back on it.This film is not perfect. The acting is not of extremely high caliber (aside from Naomi as Racherl and Daveigh as Samara). Yet there is a magic beyond the film's outer layer that disturbs the senses. The noises of the tape are a good example of this, still frightening for me today.When I saw this film at my birthday party on Sept. 5th, 2005 it was the first time I had watched it in a very long time. I did not get extremely frightened by any of it except for the classic scene where Samara crawls out of the TV. But I'm sure you could predict that.However, I will never fully recover from this movie and I will never look at static the same way again. And I thank the makers of the movie for allowing me to do so. They turned a slightly cheesy Japanese movie into something oddly beautiful and disturbing at once.

I thought it was going to be a really good scary ghost flick (I'm really big on ghost films).So imagine my disappointment when I found out what it was: just a bunch of flashy \"ooh, our camera is dropping frames, isn't that scary?\" scenes, and no real reason for it to be going on.Don't get me wrong. The effects do achieve a good deal of fright...for about the first forty minutes of the movie. After that it just felt like guys in business suits were waving their hands in front of my face going \"oooOOOOoooOOOOooooo\" while they took my six fifty and watched their sales skyrocket. Needless to say, the creepiness dwindled considerably fast.The ending of the movie will make you angry, because rather than tie everything together, they instead choose to just do a bunch of random crap. You'll understand what I mean if you see it.Long story short, this movie was just another crappily-written piece of junk with shinier effects than the ones you can rent for a dollar at your local video store. I blame the success of it on all of the dumb people I've ever known...because, honestly, they're the only ones I've ever heard rave about the scariness of this movie.'\n",

Lots of nice, disturbing visuals accompanied by a shrill noises and sudden bursts of sound...Only problem was after leaving the theater I knew I'd been cheated. All throughout the film there is an impending sense that we're obviously being led somewhere, hopefully to the mystery behind the tape on which the story revolves around.  Unfortunately, it seems the film makers have taken the easy route and left out any explanation whatsoever for anything that occurs in the film.  My guess is that we're being set up for \"The Ring 2.\" All I know is throughout the climax of the movie all I could think was, \"Now, why am I supposed to be scared by this?\" Oh, and I figured out what \"The Ring\" was the first time we get to see the tape for ourselves...that probably didn't help to heighten the suspense.  If you want my opinion, see \"Signs\" instead...'\n",

I like horror movies and I don't scare easily, but however much I know it 'isn't real', I just don't enjoy seeing an animal getting hurt. I think the point would have come across just as well if the horse had leaped over the rail, and just disappeared into the sea.

The script is a mess, but the visual style of gore verbinski has made me a believer of anything he directs.

The acting is top notch and Brian Cox is a delight to see in most anything.

Of those who disliked the film, a number of them complain that the film doesn't explain enough, while others complain that it explains too much. Some praise the film as being very intelligent and original, while others complain that the plot is too thin. It's simply amazing to me how differently people perceive the same thing. The Ring is very much original in comparison with other horror films. It is not original in the sense that it is a remake of Ringu, but so what? It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, which, to me, is a big part of what makes it creepy. Are you still as scared once you've learned all of the answers? I know I'm not. It leaves a lot to think about, to wonder about, to imagine, and whether you choose to ponder the unanswered questions or not, The Ring is scary. It is, by far, one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. Watch it on DVD, and then watch the Easter Egg - Go to the bottom right of the main menu, where it says, \"Don't look here,\" (I think that's what it says - I don't have the menu in front of me) then arrow down, and hit enter.

And it's nothing to do with Christina Angulawhatever's new clip, altho I'm pretty sure you can see the ring in that... No, this is infact the heart warming tale of a video that kills you 7 days after you've watched it. I'm not sure if watching the same thing on DVD kills you, but I suppose it does. I guess it depends how close you sit to the screen, and how violent Blockbuster get when the copy of The Little Mermaid you rented is 7 days overdue. This is another horror movie involving creepy kiddies. It seems every flick that attempts to be scarey has to involve a creepy kid in someway. That doesn't make it bad tho, it is infact pretty good. The story is nice and original (it's a remake of a Japanese version which has spawned a sequel and prequel), and the cast, led by talented Aussie Naomi Watts, is great. But is it scarey? Well I was sitting in a puddle at the end, but that may have more to do with the size of the large Coke... After being told by people who had already seen this that I'd be having nightmares afterwards I packed a change of underwear and prepared for the worst, but it didn't come. Altho there are a few sudden frights (one made the girl behind me actually scream), and while you're watching it there is an undercurrent of \"What's going to happen next??\" kind of scarey-ness, after it had finished I looked back and thought \"Well that wasn't really all that scarey\". It didn't haunt me like The Sixth Sense or Bambi did. So I guess you have to decide for yourself whether its scarey enuff or not. That said, I'm never watching a video again. Infact I came straight home and took an axe to my VCR. Then I jumped on the pieces. Then I burned my shoes. But no, this isn't scarey. Either way this is a good flick and its fun to watch. Go see it.

Other than that there's a part with a horse, and there's alot of T.V.s that blow up. Bottom Line The Bottom line is that this movie is scary and it is fun to watch.

It is a throwback to classic horror before there was even a glimmer of the slasher movies to come.  The movie has little gore but contains some of the best jump-scenes ever.  It's sexy without resorting gratuitous sex.  While it's not completely free of hokeyness, \"The Ring\" is one of the most intelligent horror films ever made. The direction is inspired and the performances are remarkably subtle.  The use of special effects is restrained but the impact hits hard.   In the end, it remains enigmatic and mysterious because it doesn't go overboard with explanations. There's also a lot to think about as it resonates with a number of themes: the harmful effects of video culture (understating the obvious), the ethical responsibility of parents for their children, and the transmission of evil into the world.  Most touchingly and ,yes, horribly, \"The Ring\" contrasts human mortality with the eternal nature of stark evil; life is fragile and short but evil lasts forever.'\n",

You watch it and find out!Acting is credible and everyone seems to give good performances. Also it's true to the original in that when the scares happen you get that \"skin crawling\" kind of fear. It's not openly scary with over the top visual effects like so many other so called Horror films, it's that psychological scary type. (My fave.) Although I will admit to looking away when I saw the face of the first dead girl - frightened the willies out of me.So my advice is watch this and the Japanese one - both are worth seeing.

Pressing on though I didn't find this film scary at all... But it is by far one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.It seems there should be a different genre for these type of films, instead of horror perhaps it would be best to label them uber-thrillers.  The movie was very suspenseful and compelling to watch in a very morbid sense. Imagine all those people that slow down driving past car accidents to see the damage and carnage.  That kind of morbidity propels the viewer through the ring with a definite sense of \"on-the-edge-of-your-seat\" tension.When you couple that dreaded sensation with the excellent sound effects, music, eerie locations and grainy film, it makes the American version of this film one of the best modern \"horror\" movies hands down.   I have still be told REPEATEDLY to see the original Japanese film if I ever get the chance as it is supposed to be far superior in story and dread. Hopefully with the American remake coming to DVD next week they'll import the Japanese version so we can enjoy it as well.'\n",

I'm used to being lured into a movie, just a little.The hair color was pretty annoying.  And the young boy under Naomi Watts charge most of the time was spooky.  The kid was innocent and good, yet scary?  I don't get it.  But I definitely did not want some sensitive Haley Joel Osmet.  So, overall, I didn't get what I wanted, no matter if the kid was different.Then there was the video.  Watts' character is disturbed, but not her video geek friend?  Not convincing that the video is horribly seductively scary. And the whole thing about the drawings.  Too Sixth Sense.  And the teacher's comment about the cousin being dead a week ago and not three days ago. What was the point of that?Here is what I did like.  I was quite disturbed the whole film.  I kept getting jerked around to believe different things, the way the characters would.  And my eyes were big as saucers by the end of the movie as if I had watched the disturbing video and was about to die myself.  I didn't scream once, but can say I had a deep soul horror, the kind that says, oh my, I hope not, really.  The black and white dull cinematography was great.  The unexplained yet, to me, logical parts of the plot I loved.  To me, when it worked, the unexplained was the wonderfully, deeply understood.I loved how the movie commented on how things spread in a community by the use of curiosity and mystery.  There was no cover or label for the bad video.I enjoyed the image of the tree.  I was not disturbed by the mirrors.  The well was very Old World looking, therefore quite cursed looking, as if Britain, land of the legend and the paranormal was about to invade the U.S.I found the movie flawed, yet compelling to watch.  It was not what you call seamless, but jerky for mystery, thrills, and some disturbing thoughts that are keeping the lights on tonight.My rating: 3/5 (for overall disturbing effect on me)SPOILER AHEAD:  DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEI hated the end.  We were supposed to draw conclusions from the dialogue between Watts' character and little scary boy?  I had no idea what they meant.  Did they go evil?  What would they do with the copy of the tape? What about the showing of the dark-haired girl going up the lift after Watts' character sees her friend is horrifically and unexpectedly dead? Did that mean knowledge?  Did blond mean no knowledge or innocence and dark hair mean knowledge?  That didn't even hold up the whole film.  And I didn't like the video girl stepping out of the screen.  Please kill me and get it over with, like the poor characters in the movie.  That is so contrived, so bottle-blond.  And how do I believe that the scary little boy would aid his mother in learning about the poor poor dead girl when he knew she was evil all along if he was actually good though weird?  Mind tricks?  Come on.'\n",

The horror of 'what ifs' is what this movie is made of. YOu fear you will die the same way Katie or Noah did. You no longer look at wells, or like TV. This movie is bound to have psychological effects on you, which makes it entertaining. ON ACTING: The acting is truly the best. Everyone must have studied hard to get their character down. Daveigh Chase (Samara MOrgan) is so well transformed into a villain/pity, that you can't even tell who she is. Her voice, look, hair, is all different. Naomi Watts (Rachel Keller) hides her accent, and becomes a very motherly figure. The rest of the cast was awesome, but I have nothing to say about them. ON EFFECTS: Samara crawling out of the TV is so scary and well done, I had nightmares for 7 days..The horse scene is a bit sad and sick, but it was well done on special effects. The make-up is so amazing, I have no idea what to say. Let me just say that Katie's face was close to no special effects. I think that deserves a medal on its own. ON LOCATION: The movie seems a bit green, but it is fine to me because I love the color green. The places were all dark and gloomy adding to the fear. MY FAVORITE MOVIE!! 11 out of 10'\n",

For every \"Citizen Kane\", there must also be a \"Charlie Chan\", so I'd have to say that apples need to stop being put up to oranges.\"The Ring\" leans very heavily on suspension of disbelief. Yes, the premise is wacky. Yes, there's no rational, empirical reason for some of the events that transpire within it. If there were, it would take longer and probably be laughable. The point is that what is happening on the screen is happening whether you like it or not, so play along and see where it goes. After all, when we sit down to watch \"Lord of the Rings\", do we complain endlessly that orcs, elves and dwarves don't really exist? When we watch \"Silence of the Lambs\", do we debate in circles for hours how fast it would take Lecter to skin a man's face off that convincingly?Enjoy the ride while it lasts.

            "Why does that girl have the ability to project her evil onto videotape, specifically?  Why doesn't she just run a pirate video feed into, like, ESPN or A&E or something and be done with it?  Or better yet wait until Super Bowl Sunday?Where did Samara come from?  They \"went away\" and came back with her, telling everyone that she was adopted; Richard said that Anna wasn't ever meant to have a child and that Samara wasn't his child and yet we see the birth certificate in Richard's house, naming him as the father.Katie clearly took the death threat seriously, since she told Aidan about it, so what was with the joking and then \"sudden realization\" that it was all true the night she died?How did Samara manage to live in so many places for so long?  She lived in the barn, she lived in the hospital, she lived in the family's mainland home. . .  And why hasn't that tree gotten bigger in the last 14 years?Why did Aidan say all that about \"the horses keep her awake; she doesn't like living in the dark\" when he should have said, \"she's *evil*; don't help her\"?  That is, of course, why Rachel couldn't drag Aidan around with her, not because she'd be exposing him to danger, but because the whole movie would have ended right then.Why bother setting up an ongoing theme of maternal love and rejection if the real message was \"she's evil and it's never going to stop\"?I understand that this movie is the remake of a part of a trilogy, but they should have made this movie make sense within itself, rather than, apparently, just copying down the bits that were revealed in the corresponding movie in hopes that the American moviegoing public will foot the bill for two more.'\n",

            "Review: 'This Review May Contain Small Spoilers (they may actually save you the time you waste if you do see the movie anyway because at least then you may get a laugh in). When I first saw previews for The Ring I was rather intrigued. I read a summary on line and the idea of a people dying from watching a videotape was new to me so I decided to check it out. However, when I saw this movie in the theaters i was bored, unimpressed, and even a little let down. The actors couldn't act and the only thing that made them stand out from the actual set was the fact they were either dying or screaming. A lot of the movie was taken up with flashbacks that eventually lead to us realizing how the tape was created and why people die when they watch it. The style of going backwards in a movie to piece together a story that sucks never succeeds and is just wasting your time. The Ring is supposed to be a horror movie but there is little to be horrified with. Every now and then there will be one of those some dead girl screaming somewhere in a tight space like a closet or a well which only helps you stay awake for more stupidity. The special effects were lame and the behind the scenes crew were lazy. More than once I saw things left in the background including even an actual worker for the crew. Overall this was a lousy movie and a waste of time. Do not see this movie unless you like to be bored or you like to be disappointed. I was disappointed when I saw The Ring and it really dampened my faith in ghost stories.'\n",

Most horror movies contain all these things when it is completely unnecessary. I am not Mr. Ultra Conservative, but I find a movie more creative when you don't have to fill it up with such things. I watched this movie with a friend on a big screen TV in DTS. There were definitely several scenes that made me jump and that hasn't happened in a LONG time! The only reason I docked the movie 2 stars was because it was a bit slow and there wasn't quite enough \"jumpy\" scenes.

If it doesn't become as popular as Blair Witch Project, than there is something wrong with the audiences (although to compare this one to Blair Witch is blasphemous, given how bad the Blair Witch Project was).  The film does, however, copy a great deal from the great 1980s horror film, The Changeling, starring George C. Scott.  In fact, I am greatly surprised that it hasn't been labeled a remake!!  I can't believe the film, or the original book, ripped off the Changeling in such a blatant way!  However, this aside, the film is not just horrifying, it's psychologically scarring.

After watching it, stunned by what they saw, they received a phone call saying they will die in exactly seven days. Believing the tape was some sort of twisted joke, they shrugged of the feeling and lived life as usual. But a week passed since they watched the video and all four ended up with the same fate: dead. Katie's mother, confused and shaken by the loss of her daughter, asked Rachel, her sister, to find out what really happen to their troubled girl.Now determined to solve the mystery of Katie's death, Rachel finds herself and her son, Hayden with the same fate as her niece. Can she save her life and Aidan's as well? Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Ring gives a fairly decent work of art. I applaud Gore for directing the effect of viewers sensing that they're not alone anymore from start to finish. However, I find the tape (The Death Tape, as I nicknamed it.) disturbing. It was some of the images of the finger and the suicidal horse that made me feel unusual, almost at the point of being uncomfortable.The cast was also very well picked. Naomi Watts, who played Rachel, gives a performance that will surely give her more success in her career. But what was more surprising was the work of little David Dorfman who played Aidan. He gave some excellent acting skills in The Ring. The girl who haunts the tape (Daveigh Chase who acts as Samara) gave a frightening job as well.The Ring was, I thought, more of a thrill then a horror movie, but it does frighten well. But I heed a warning to those who want to rent 'The Ring'. If you're easily disgusted, then I suggest you pick another movie to watch. To those who ignored my warning, however, will surely be pleased that they did, because it really is a one of a kind movie. I give 'The Ring' a two thumbs up well done.'\n",

The scenery is beautiful and the clues Naomi searches out add to the drama of the film.Again I took all of this as more of a drama than a horror being I was trying to guess the whole time instead of jumping or getting chills.There are many scenes which stand out in my head even when i am not even thinking of the movie.That alone is a reason to see this film.Rachel's son's demeanor and glare throughout the film were a welcomed presence, that definitely added to the movie.The end i felt overall was a little corny being Samarah just wanted to be heard and that is why ultimately Rachel and her son don't die , being that Rachel made a copy and showed it to her ex beau and later has her son make a copy so he also survives.In my eyes being heard doesnt mean making copies of a video tape and showing it to people when the tape had no real answers from Samarah anyway , so how is she being heard ? But i won't go any further on why i didn't like the film being the scenery and the mystery of the tape make this film a stand out .Overall id give it a 7.5 - 10 not .Some flaws but not enough to bring the movie down , go see this'\n",

I did appreciate the fact that this film did scare me...and not like a roller-coaster ride scary, it was like a slow leakage that stayed in my head long after I watched this film.  There are many images that are shocking and the Cinematography is very nice, gives the movie the dark image that makes it so creepy.  The reason why I say don't forget the others, is that, this is one of many in the past few years that has the potential to set the standard for horror suspense.  The Ring, The Sixth Sense, The Others...I really hope that when Hollywood sees the dollar signs that these movies are brining, then maybe we can move away from Horror-Comedy, Hip-Horror or whatever you want to call it, and make a picture that will generally scare the hell out of you.'\n",

Original Ringu was one of the movie that stayed on your mind over a week. And even after couple day, you could still feel the impact of the movie. The Ring, remake was different. I was willing to even accept to quirky plot about the horse but what the complete let down was the ENDING!!! Ringu didn't have to reply on much SFX or jumping right in front of you scare tactics to get you scared. Whole atomosphere was what made the movie. For the most part, The Ring (2002) was okay, maybe even on the par with the original except the ending. Especially when the Samara come out the tv. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?????? Remake is a complete let down....Go figure...once again... Since American producers can't come up any decent plot, they have to reply on import movie and add some lame sfx and make some quick bucks. I think I'll just watch the original Ringu. If you seen Ringu, don't bother with The Ring. LAME!LAME!LAME!!Ringu 8/10 star The Ring (2002) 2/10 stars'\n",

The plot makes sense and moves along and you get to know why the characters are acting as they do.  One of the best parts is that it turns several cliche scenes around and doesnt present them in the same way.  In an early scene a female charecter opens a a fridge door and pours a drink, the scene is set up for something to happen to her right then as a lesser directer would have, however here it just serves to build tension.  The are several nice twists and turns in the movie following this, and a nice surprise ending, following following a very nicely done false finish.The movie is shot were every scene has a sort of griminess and darkness to it, which really raises the creepyness of the plot to a new level.  My only complaint is that the actress in the opening scenes did not seem to really mesh.  I also got the feeling somewhere that this movie was Rosemary's Baby 2. but maybe that is just me.   The acting in my opinion, especially of the star Naomi Watts, really improves as the movie rolls along.Overall very well done and far better than most.'\n",

            "Review: 'I thought I'd take the advice of the pretentious minority one this one, those who highly recommended watching the Japanese film, 'Ringu', before watching the clearly superior American re-make. After watching the generally unimpressive original, I truly wasn't expecting alot from this film - after all, 'The Ring' didn't benefit from being a sexy foreign film, it must have been dumbed down to appeal to mainstream, borderline retarded American crowds, and most of the element of surprise had been wasted by my watching Ringu - right?Remember, Japanese audiences flock by the hysterical thousands to watch Jennifer Love Hewitt sing.Period, point blank, and that's the bottom line - 'The Ring' is superior to the original in every conceivable way - and it managed to thoroughly compel me while seriously freaking me out. Sometimes the book is better than the movie, sometimes a bands first album really is their best, and sometimes that guy blabbering on about not watching TV really doesn't watch TV. But in this case, feel free to ignore anyone telling you that 'The Ring' just can't hold a candle to the always superior foreign film.Forget about some very impressive special effects and remarkable cinematography that come with an obviously bigger budget (and when I say 'forget', I mean for the sake of comparison, not for the sake of enjoying the film). Compare the character development. Compare the attentions to detail. Compare the ambience, the general mood captured by 'The Ring' that was so lacking in 'Ringu'. And leave out the need to tell anyone who prefers the american film that they \"just don't understand\" the japanese version - I understand it just fine.***Potential spoilers, I guess.....Why in god's name should I like Ryuji, Reiko or their son (so unimportant and underplayed that I won't even bother to remember what his name was)? Call it a cultural difference if you like, but Ryuji is downright repulsive as a character, and Reiko was frustratingly weak and irrelevant. Conversely, Aidan is actually developed as an intriguing individual within a few minutes of the film. Kinda important, eh? Aren't I supposed to care one way or the other about his mother's eventually tireless quest to save his life? The relationship between all three Kellers was infinitely more interesting than the poor presentation of the same in 'Ringu'. Ryuji-Reiko? No chemistry, no real look into their past, no invitation to wonder about anything between the two beyond the faux finish of the film. Noah and Rachel actually had me believing they were once together, and more importantly had me wanting them to finish that way despite knowing it wasn't gonna happen ahead of time. Reiko and son? Forget it. I guess for the foreign film fan, it's preferable to just assume that a mother loves her son, so let's not bother with actually developing that on screen. Rachel and Aidan had some serious tension between them. And Ryuji-son? Nothing! No, I don't mean almost nothing, I mean LITERALLY NOTHING. Noah and Aidan managed to build something of interest in two minutes of meaningful dialogue.As for comparing Sadako/Samara - not even close. A Ringu proponent on this website actually said that samara was all wrong because she has thick black hair and only Japanese girls can have a mop like that? Jeez, just another example of the pretentious artsy fartsies reaching for straws. Samara was genuinely evil, but that revelation was done so well. She was a legitimate child of the Morgans, but something went wrong as they pressed fate in an attempt to have a child. She tortured her mother with her ability to 'imprint', caused her suicide, and eventually managed to imprint again beyond the grave. Sorry, but Sadako being extremely psychic because her mother was and maybe her father was not of this world is just not as compelling a story.I used to play in a terrible band called Deus Ex Machina - saw the term in the dictionary and thought it sounded cool. Basically, it's a term to describe a method of filling in a plot hole. In 'Ringu', there are Machina's galore, the most blatant being that Ryuki has frikkin' ESP, yes ladies and gentlemen, he has real psychic powers. Need to find out what really happened to Samara/Sadako? In 'The Ring', it actually requires some detective work, finding a tape from a psychiatric hospital, following clues left by Samara, pestering her father. In 'Ringu', things are much easier - just touch someone's head and the entire plot is explained! Wanna find her final resting place? In 'The Ring', the Kellers follow a serious of clues, left from Samara's ability to imprint, that lead them in spite of the fact that they don't truly understand why they are being led. In 'Ringu', Ryuji actually knows he's in a horror film! \"If we find her body and release her soul, the curse will be lifted\", and \"let's start digging here, because I'm psychic and the director couldn't come up with a plausible way for us to legitimately find the well\". Rubbish.Opening scene? 'The Ring' had me running for a fresh pair of Haines, despite the fact that I knew what was going to happen. 'Ringu' rushed through it as though they were trying to conserve film.The money shot? I thought 'Ringu' was just fine here, very frightening, hence the very similar scene in the American version. I liked the touch of fingernail close-ups in Ringu, the special effects and the fact that Samara looked like someone who died in a well in 'The Ring'. Fact is, though, that I was alright with Ryuji getting his at the end - I wasn't so cool with it happening to Noah, and that makes a world of difference.I really could keep going on. So much more depth to 'the Ring', and so much patchwork holding 'Ringu' together. Props to the original for making a nice flick from a novel on a limited budget, but calling it a superior film to 'The Ring' is just utter nonsense. Yes, the American version did follow the original closely in some spots - all the right spots if you ask me. And it strayed from the original in all the right ways as well (get it? as WELL). Verbinski took a mediocre B-movie and made it an unforgettable cinematic experience.'\n",

            "Review: 'I've been a fan of the original Ring (Ringu here), and sure The Ring doesn't meet up to the quality of the original, but this is still a solid horror movie and an adaptation if you want to compare.Ringu drew the horror with its intense mood (rather than shock/jumping scenes), and The Ring doesn't fail at doing it either. Acting is solid, and the music is as creepy as the original. It is definitely a \"different\" type of horror movie than the traditional American \"slasher\" films, and I'm sure both horror movie fans and non-horror movie fans can enjoy (and be scared) this film.The downside is that the plot was almost as I expected, leaving me with nothing new to take away. I guess its unfair to judge it this way, since it is an adaptation, but I did hope that the director would add some kind of change that made The Ring distinct from Ringu.Also, I felt that the presence of Samara was very toned down compared to Ringu. In Ringu, Sadako was an angry girl that I would wet my pants upon meeting, but in the Ring, Samara seemed almost like a sad girl with a sad past and no more. I'm sure other people would disagree, but at least the character of Samara did leave me with less fear for compared to Sadako (which was borderline traumatizing). But in either case, fans of American horror films would most likely feel a lack of impact that the main villain would leave, compared so lets say Freddy Krueger.Otherwise, its still a solid movie. I suggest anybody to watch it for a taste of so-called J-Horror adaptation.'\n",

This is so unlike what the media presents as horror:blood,gore,sex, and alot of screaming but sure that's good every once and a while but not all the time. Let it be known that The Ring contains everything that I found makes a movie riveting,spellbinding, and scary as hell. This movie plays with your mind it freaks you out in ways you never thought possible, it brings out those nightmares in the back of your mind that scare you senseless. As you watch the movie it starts off scaring you right from the beginning and the fright fest never halts. The vagueness of the movie on specific subjects is what scares like for instance the actual tape that kills; it never shows how the ladder is standing up by itself or how the girl's image is in the mirror but no-one is actually there. As you play these images through your head you come up with things that force you to the edge of horror and that's what makes this movie excellent. It lets you scare yourself while it terrifies you.10/10  It makes your blood run cold with fear!!!!!!!'\n",

It really had a nice atmosphere and was wonderfully photographed (it really did feel like it took place in late fall/early winter in Washington State).  The makeup and effects were really well used, and the music and sound effects gave it a perfect atmosphere.My big issue is the last act.  It feels like a cheat.  Halfway through the movie morphed into a nice mystery and climaxed with a really cathartic scene where Naomi Watts' character discovers what really happened to the girl on the video.  She goes through hell to get to the bottom of the mystery of the Morgan family in order to save her own.  After all that build up and the emotional journey you have taken with these characters into this living nightmare, it just felt like a huge cheat when the movie kept going past its logical end and turned back into a traditional horror story in the last little bit.  What was the point of her unraveling the mystery when the tape was just a really nasty chain letter?  And if it was just a chain letter, why would the evil spirit hide the fact that copying it was the only way to live?  If the person KNEW that was the deal, they'd be more apt to make copies and it would spread faster (and plot wise it would lead to some nice scenes of the characters agonizing over if they should make a copy and live, or sacrifice their life to destroy the tape once and for all).  The ending just felt wrong.  The other 3/4 of the movie I loved, however.'\n",

I am glad the re-make honors the original concept.  Several meaningful items(to scare you) in the original are dropped in the American Ring.

Yes, it has some moments where you may jump a little bit, but those moments are few and far apart. The movie is mostly psychological, with many freakish moments, for example, the haunted tape. The story is pretty good. It's about a video tape that kills its viewers seven days after they watch it, and a reporter who tries to investigate its mystery after watching it herself. You probably will need to see the movie more than once to fully understand the plot, but when you do, it'll be worth it. I couldn't help but ask, why? I won't ruin the story for you, but after you watch it, you'll be asking the same question. Since this movie is based on the hit Japanese film, Ringu, you might have already seen it, but I doubt that. And it has many differences with the superior Japanese version. All in all, The Ring is a great movie to watch at night time, in a dark room, with few people huddled around the television set. Definitely check this one out.Final Score - 9 / 10'\n",

            "Review: 'Do you want to see a horror movie filled with gore, blood, sex, and swearing!? Well ... don't watch this movie. This movie amazed me because of it's originality. While other movies are coming out like \"Freddy vs. Jason\" and \"Jeepers Creepers\" which are partially scary only because of their gore content, \"The Ring\" probably took a risk by coming out in the midst of these movies. The basis of the movie revolves around an urban legend about a video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it. The video is a mix of horrifying clips of various things -- a woman jumping off of a cliff, a nail through the finger, dead animals -- and as soon as the video ends you get a mysterious phone call. \"Seven days,\" the person says at the other end, and soon enough, at the end of the seventh day, you unexplainably die. A newspaper reporter's niece suddenly dies and rumors are going around it's because of this \"killer video tape\". She tries to unravel this mystery and ends up watching the tape herself. She tries to figure out how to undo the video tape's \"curse\". As the movie goes along there are very scary parts, and overall the movie has a spooky feel to it. 10 out of 10!'\n",

            "Review: 'Out of all the horror films I have ever seen this wins heads down. I wouldn't consider this as a horror movie as I normally associate horror with blood and gore and terror with mind haunting and chilling. This is a terror movie. My eccentric old maths teacher made my class and I watch it as punishment for 'scaring' him all year. From the moment it started I couldn't rip my eyes away from the screen. Most of the girls in my class were screaming when that poor girl got killed. The atmosphere was so effective as well. The constant raining in Seattle, the clouds, the TREE (I still have dreams about it) and the cursed people's clouded faces when ever a photo was taken of them or if they were under video surveillence.I couldn't concentrate for the rest of the day (and to be honest I don't scare easily!). I had drama next and luckily I watched Carousel to wash the images from my mind. \"Oh the Ring. My its terrifying. Jack saw it and stayed awake all night and it takes a lot to scare him! Watch the Sound of Music a few times and you'll be back to normal\" my drama teacher said. Its been over 5 months since I've seen the Ring, my friend recommends that I see the Japanese version. It doesn't have as many special effects but what it suggests it much more terrifying, is what he said. I think I'll pass there. After watching the Ring you think more deeply about the plot and what the 'video' was really about. So the reason Naomi didn't die at the end was because she let her husband watch it and so pass on the ring to someone else. Also the woman in the video was a psychic of some sort who burned her thoughts into it. Well for those of you haven't seen it I'll not ruin the plot anymore but be prepared for very late nights!'\n",

The movie left some questions unanswered but I guess that helps set up a sequel which I see is coming out Spring of 2005. There's a lot of detail to the story-line so it might help to watch a couple of times to follow every detail. The extra footage on the DVD was confusing to watch right after the movie, think of it as deleted scenes and alternate endings. The characters are likable. The scenery is fun.

            "Review: 'I am amazed that nobody has posted a thread saying one bad word against this film. If you want to appreciate the remake of a film, see the original first. As with music, if you are going to remake or remix something, you must add something to it that gives it a different style but still appeals to people that liked the original. As far as i can see, this remake has failed to do this by a mile, and furthermore, is an insult to the effort of the craft and collaboration between Koji Suzuki and Hideo Nakata that went into making the original a genuinely original and revolutionary horror film.The plot is so much more unnecessarily complicated than the original. Half of the original plot twists from the original, and even aspects of the narrative, are removed and replaced with totally convoluted and unbelievable ones. What was all this business about the barn that Samara allegedly stayed in? What was all the excess nonsense about the lighthouse? What was all that confusing and unnecessary crap about mother in the papers and hospital records that ultimately leads to nothing? We find out that Samara was killed by her mother. Not only was this contrary to the father performing the act in the original, but also we never know why. Fair enough, you do not know why in the original unless you see Ring 0 but in the original, Dr Ikuma was not given anywhere enough attention for the viewer to actually worry about not knowing. In comparison, the remake focuses a lot on revealing about the past of Samara's mother, but does not give any hint as to why should would have any motive for killing her daughter. This leaves the viewer frustrated and confused. I agree that the unexplained is frightening, but this has to be taken to a lesser degree when concerning the fate of pivotal characters. Clearly, the director has not paid any attention to these problems and this puts a stain on the genius of the original, which found the perfect balance.The character's were far less believable in this version, and is a further insult to the believability of the original. None of the leads were particularly outstanding. The innocence of Yoichi in the original, with sensible dialogue to convey his emotion and confusion of being wrapped up in the essence of the tape's curse, is replaced in the remake by a bad-mouthed, precocious little brat that contributes nothing to the film either in terms of the constant eerie aura that sweeps through the film that Nakata masterfully conveys, nor the sympathy you extend to Yoichi, again through the lack of believable dialogue, which makes him sound like a spoilt little runt, rather than an innocent caught up in the curse. Because of this, the very child's presence in this remake irritated me and I had no concern for his feelings in the film, what little there were of them (which were unconvincingly portrayed anyhow), which ultimately further lacks the constant mix of horror and anxiety that every character in Ring represents to the viewer. Yet again, such flaws are insult to the sure-handiness of the original.There are characters that are introduced, turns in the plot, and objects, which are left unresolved. For example, the friend of the first victim from the beginning of the film does not appear in the original. We are given the feeling of her importance to the film and yet by the end we do not know of, nor care, for her fate. It gives the impression that her role in the film was merely a red herring device to confuse the audience, as if by two thirds of the way through we are not confused enough already. You are left asking the question 'Why?' with a sense of immense frustration rather than anxious pleasure.Finally, we are plagued with CGI to convey horror. A big reason that Hideo Nakata's original was so appealing was that it was simplistic in its conveyance of terror, and therefore terrifyingly effective. I am referring to Ringu's ending, whereby we are greeted with the chilling realisation of Sadako's wrath. In the original, this scene was so successful because a real human being crawled from the TV set, thereby conveying the horror of the most unbelievable thing in most realistic way possible. You can't help but feel cheated when CGI is used. This is a clear case of where the more advanced most certainly does not equate to the most effective. The director has gone so far in making Samara unreal, that there is no physically real aspect to her at all Â– instead, she is some kind of digital ghost without any real presence. Adding flickers to the edge of her character as if a flickering TV screen unfortunately clearly shows where the film's priorities lie. As such, I felt little fear in comparison to the total body muscular tension I experienced in the scene from the original Ringu.Overall, this film has failed on every level compared to Ringu. Rather than honouring Ringu's history with a modern horror in the spirit of Japanese film making while adding more, it has instead tarnished it with unnecessary, unbelievable, and incomplete plot twists and characters that typically reflect the abuse of a comparatively massive Hollywood budget.It is sad that the genius of the original will always be associated with this. I can only hope that Japanese cinema gets the credit it deserves so that more people will be more likely and more inclined to see the original foreign version of a film first. Until then, when the word Ring appears in film-talk, this inferior remake will be the first that comes to mind and the brilliance of the superior original will be overlooked. A shame. A real shame.'\n",

            "Review: 'When I heard that Ringu was being made in Hollywood, I was appalled. When it came out and did well, I ignored it. I finally watched it last week and cannot believe it has done as well, both critically and financially. The acting is so wooden it's not funny, especially Naomi Watts. How reviews failed to point this out amazes me. I was led to believe that the film was a, practically, frame for frame remake of the original. The opening 15 minutes or so are nearly exactly the same and I began to be drawn in. But then the video comes into play and as each element in it is revealed in the storyline I got more and more frustrated. Some elements do survive the ordeal but some images cannot have been made by Samara (the scene of her mother's suicide for instance, the \"burning tree\" for instance etc etc). In fact the whole character of Samara makes no sense at all. Why was she put into the hospital? What had she done? What's with the pictures she \"created\"? Why did she get let out? Are her parents really her parents (showing a partial birth certificate for a second or two is only going to make me angrier!)? Why does her touch burn? It is an insult to my intelligence (and yours!)! There is no sense of doom, of urgency in any of the characters. There is no sense of geography. When 10 minutes of story would have, maybe, helped move the story along, we get 10 minutes of frantic action with no meaning. Why?! What Hideo Nakata did to Koji Suzuki's awesome novel was to take the important parts and overlay a supernatural story over the top. The Ring has taken the important parts out of Ringu and overlays a different supernatural story over the rest. The problem with The Ring is that the story they used is pathetically weak in comparison to that in Ringu. And if the US market is willing to accept it as \"better\" then that merely exposes the \"quality\" of contemporary US horror. I recommend that everyone read the book in addition to watching Ringu as a remedy to this disaster of a movie. Although it looks good and contains some shocks, it is too flawed to be a version of Ringu or a satisfying horror movie in its own right.'\n",

I can only rate this movie for what has been made, and thats just re-shooting a good movie and earning money in the process.

It was Thursday night, a three-day weekend, and I didn't think twice about going to see a scary movie (I do not fare well with horror flicks)-- I just wanted to have a good time. Wish I knew what I was getting myself into...The movie, at first glance, seems a bit corny-- the girls talking about the video tape seems a bit abrupt and urban-legendish. However, the movie got creepy when the TV kept turning on by itself...and I can't even describe how freaked out I got when they showed Katie's corpse. Whoever did that model is a genius-- I don't think I've ever seen a more disturbing image in my life!! I was really tempted to get up and walk out of the movie theatre right then and there, but the movie sucked me in, and I decided to stick it out.\n",
            "Well, the movie got scarier-- the plot is absorbing, the cinemetography was outstanding, and the acting was more than believable-- especially the little boy. His eyes were really freaky when he was imploring his mother, \"You weren't supposed to help her!\" And who would believe that Samara was the same girl who did the voice of Lilo from \"Lilo and Stitch\"?! The great thing about the movie was that it didn't spell out the plot for the audience-- the writer of the screenplay obviously thought a bit higher of the IQ's of the viewers, and certain aspects left to the imagination are much much creepier than spoonfeeding the plot to the audience. And the other thing that sets this apart from other creepy flicks is that the plot doesn't end with the usual \"the-ghost-was-an-innocent-child-whose-murder-was-uncovered-and-whose-undisc overed-corpse-was-put-to-rest-so-now-everyone's-happy\" note that most ghost stories end with. Samara was purely evil, and while the movie doesn't explain why, the fact that she just won't quit even when the movie ends was enough to freak me out. *shudder* I'm never having kids.And of course, I must comment on the creepiest scene in the movie-- initially, throughout the movie, people (mostly middle school girls scattered throughout the theatre) would let out a scream or two at the scary parts (i.e. the centipede, and the corpse in the closet). However, when Samara starts walking toward the screen and out of the TV, they were screaming NONSTOP. That is probably the most memorable scene in any horror flick, next to the head-revolving scene from \"The Exorcist\". People were literally trying to crawl back in their seats.Like I mentioned before, I don't fare well with horror flicks, and I spent most of the time hiding behind my coat through this one. But let me tell you, if you're going for an actual SCARY movie, not just a slasher that will make you sick to your stomach, then I highly recommend this one. The plot will make you think, the cinemotography is great-- and I really can't think of anything wrong with it. I give it a 10 out of 10.'\n",

Despite a few changes, the basic story (even the pacing of the film) remain intact, almost identical altogether (see the opening scene with the two teenage girls in the beginning of both films).  \"Ringu\" is still a good thrill ride.I think the US version of \"The Ring\" fills in a couple holes that original left maybe a bit too open-ended.  More of the story behind Samara/Sadako is revealed; instead of wishing for the little girl to remain dead, you feel sorry for her and understand her reasons for doing what she does.  Not only this but I think a bigger budget really helped out in the US version. The exaggerated deaths, creepier video, and surreal Samara/Sadako add quite a bit to the film (I don't think inverting the colors on the screen are a convincing way to show someone dying...).So see both movies, you'll like them both - but there's no way the US version takes away from \"Ringu\" - it's better.'\n",

There does seem to be a line of horror film convention this movie follows, yet it far succeeds a lot of those films. I loved the use of the filter they used to make this film look really dark and blue to create that atmosphere. The quick cutting techniques at moments of suspense were terrifying, to say the least.

First of all, as \"good\" of a movie as the Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby was, they weren't really scary (maybe a little bit). For their time, maybe so.

There are some things that go unexplained (like how Samara's thought's got on video in the first place)...I would have liked them explained, but, I am not sure it was crucial to the movie.I won't spoil the ending but I thought it would have been better if it has ended about 2 minutes earlier than it really did; I do have to say that the ending was much better than where I thought it was going to end while I was watching it.  I suppose that the ending made things all nice and neat and reinforced the theme of the movie (see above).Overall, the suspense level was very high and it was well directed and visually appealing.'\n",

I'm not usually the Gory type but i love being scared, and if you want to be scared, this is definitely the movie to watch. Its great how it has scary moments, but still a bit of humor to soften it up a bit. When i watched it with my buds, a couple of us screamed at points when things popped up. But so far as the story, i think it is excellent. Just the texture and how every single clue just fits in like a jigsaw puzzle. it stinks about how its a cliffhanger. I've never seen the original version, and after seeing the remake, i think it would be awkward. The video tape is freaky though,i wish someone would make a movie like that and as a joke, pass it around the world. Just a thought. I don't really see how anyone couldn't find this movie interesting. Overall, it is a good movie, with a lot of suspense and intelligent quotes. I really liked it.'\n",

            "Review: 'Ring is a rather morbid movie with a simple yet original concept: An unmarked video tape that kills whoever watches it.Naomi Watts plays a reporter who(urged by her sister) investigates the sudden death of her niece. After snooping around a little, the clues lead her to a sinister tape viewed by the teens in a remote cabin. After watching the tape, she receives a warning that she has only \"7 days\" to live. As the countdown begins, the cynical reporter begins to believe in the curse of the tape and tries her best to break the curse.Though I've not seen the original Japanese version, I think this remake has the potential to draw in a lot of fans in the U.S. The story keeps the tension level up well enough as it takes you on a journey to discover the origin and meaning of the tape. However, the most important aspect of the story is that you never expect what will happen next and it leaves lot to your imagination. It isn't gory nor revolting but it does prove itself to be a horror flick that deserves some attention in the midst of the many teen-angst-slasher-horror movies that are so common these days. Kudos to Daveigh Chase, the best child character actor to come out of Hollywood since Haley Joel Osment.'\n",

I was shaking for the entire 107 minutes of film time, then all through the credits.  I found my breathing patterns had slowed down, returned to normal, when I woke up this morning.I am quite a fan of the thriller/horror genre.  SCREAM is one of my favourite movies.  But I must say, no movie has ever really frightened me, and I was proud to admit that.  I mean, JEEPERS CREEPERS was slightly creepy for a selected few moments, but the feeling passes quickly - and it was hardly there, anyway.I'm not going to give you a plot summary, an indepth analysis of the story. Those who are interested will go and see the movie.  But I will say, the direction was fantastic.  Gore Verbinski (The Mexican) did a fantastic job. Australian, Naomi Watts was nothing short of flawless. And that little creepy kid, Aidan, was very good, too.I have rated more than 300 movies on this website, but this is only the second time I have left a comment - I was THAT impressed with it.If you don't like horror films, you should still find this as a well-made piece of cinema. THE RING is still more than a 'dumb old horror flick'. It's clever, sharp, and just downright scary.Thankyou for your time.THE RING (2002)  10/10'\n",

I got round to seeing it tonight, and it isn't a bad film at all.--SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW--One thing I came away with was noticing a lot of similarities to other films. It was nearly always raining, much like in Se7en. The kid, well, he harks back to Sixth Sense. It has strong hints of Scream in the opening sequence. There are many other small parts which are common, but still, it has a very unique style.There is some great cinematography in the film as well. The use of the creeping up behind you camera technique is used, but not overused. Some unique viewpoints, such as inside the filing cabinet draws.The score is also amazing - never intrusive, always fits well with the action. Music can make a horror film, and it helps a lot here.After the scene in the well at Shelter Mountain, a great sense of relief is imparted to the audience. You feel like the film is over, it's all relaxed. Then suddenly it turns round again and all gets going. This is done very well.Some good use of computer graphics as well. When Samara comes alive out of the TV, it's done well. The TV like effect, although it has been used a fair bit recently (House on Haunted Hill), is well done.A few things didn't work though. When Anna kills Samara by the well, they both appear to be wearing very old clothing, certainly pre-1960. However, she kills her with a plastic bin bag - it just seems a little odd. The numbers screwing up on the video - they are generally just an arbitary index that the video player generates. The light house lighting just looks wrong, the way it sweeps the floor in the Morgan's house (hmm... maybe inherited from House on Haunted Hill as well).The major problem - the viewer is given a lot of specific information. You learn a timeline, where things happened, why they happened. There is so much there that it feels like it should piece together better. You are left at the end, not really knowing much for certain, but knowing so many small parts, that your mind doesn't want to wander and try to work out the solution. The cross between fact, fiction, and the supernatural world portrayed just doesn't mix properly.It's hard to describe what I mean. Take Magnolia - that leaves a lot of people feeling like they have wasted 2 hours (I think it was longer...). There is so much there, and bits of it pull together, and others don't, leaving you feeling empty at the end. Then there is Mullholland Dr. - again, lots of disjointed events, but they are linked together so lightly, that at the end of the day, you mind has time to explore the hundreds of possibilites.All in all, a good horror film, better than most recent ones.'\n",

I've seen Scary Movie 3 so many times I couldn't help but laugh at a lot of parts in the movie. Definitely took away from the \"scary\" aspect of the movie with my mind being focused on a goofy comedy the whole time. That's my own problem though. The movie itself is terrific visually and has a captivating story. Creepy, but a little more on the mysterious side than it is the on the scary side. There's a bit of a twist at the end I really liked too. The ending was maybe a little anti-climactic and left me with several questions. I wouldn't have minded a bit deeper dive into the lore but I can also respect it being left open ended. All in all, worth the watch. Good horror movie.'\n",

The direction is great, (it mirrors Kubrick's direction of The Shining), the acting is awesome, and is wonderfully crafted into a climax that is one of the most memorable moments on film.  I haven't seen the original, however I do feel that all the people complaining, and criticizing it because of the fact that it is a remake should grow up, and realize that new movies can be commended. The Ring shows a type of horror few movies can pull off... Psychological terror.  This movie should make tons at the box office, because of word of mouth alone,  despite all the mediocre reviews its getting from the critics... only because its a remake.  I wish people could realize the brilliance of this movie.  I also wish people who feel important criticizing a movie could grow up and admit they were scared. Yeah you heard me.SEE THE RING!'\n",

However, as the positive reviews came in, I began to warm to the idea. So, last night, with a friend in tow, I went to see Gore Verbinski's latest cinematic effort... and I was very pleasently surprised with the result.Although it starts off in the style of a teen kill movie, it swiftly takes a left turn and delves into a darker, more intense movie. Verbinski's expert directing and the neat work from the cast really had me compelled throughout the entire movie. Naomi Watts, of the \"Mulholland Drive\" fame delivers a solid portrayal of a diligent and intelligent journalist Rachel Keller who, at the same time is not exactly the most attentive mother of her son, Aidan (David Dorfman). However, her attitude and priorities change when,  investigating the shocking and mysterious death of her niece, she watches a video tape that her niece and her boyfriend watched 7 days prior to their deaths. Rachel is skeptical, but at the same time very curious as to how a video tape can herald the death of anyone who watches it. After watching the notorious and disturbing tape, Rachel recieves a deadly phone call notifying Rachel of imminent death within 7 days. From there, it becomes a race against time for Rachel, and when Aidan and her ex-lover Noah (Martin Henderson) watches the video, her search becomes more frantic. As they piece together the clues as to what the images in the tape mean and how to avert their deaths, Rachel discovers all is not what it seems.I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Although it did not have the EXACT same intensity as \"Ringu\" this film was chock-a-block full of suspense and did not rely on liberal use of gore, swearing and T&A unlike other \"horror\" films. The chief characters in this film are nicely fleshed out by their respective actors and actresses that I actually felt for them in the various situations that they encounter.Out of 5, I give \"The Ring\": ****'\n",

I never developed any attachment to the characters, and I was never afraid at any point in the film. It was a big mistake to try and Americanize a story that is based upon Japanese myth, legend, and some fact. The \"horse\" avenue ended in a dead end and it was just stupid to include it ( this is of course a result of trying to put an American spin on a Japanese story ).It lacks the focus, imagination and the \"chill\" of the original. Even the flash scenes of the victims were a disappointment. The only things I liked about the film were a couple of subtle things that help to further clarify the original story. The reference to there being no \"signature time track\" on the tape, and the meaning of the 7 day period between watching and dying ( the number of days she survived in the well ).I consider this a misguided and botched attempt to improve on an original film, and the attempt ended in dismal failure.I suggest that if he wants to improve on the original, he should use his money and influence to try and arrange to have the original Japanese Ring dubbed in English, digitally enhanced, and made available on a special edition DVD with region1 encoding in wide screen.This is the only way that the original will be improved upon, and he could have done this for a hell of a lot less money than he spent in screwing up the original.

But that woman brushing her hair in the mirror was so creepy! ugh. I also liked how eventually the main character saw all the things from the videotape. Very nice. But the guy in the bathtub was just gross. When the girl crawled out of the TV I started shouting at the screen without realizing it and my friends told me later the whole theater was laughing at me. The fact that they were hitting me should have tipped me off. The long hair in front of Samara's face was very nicely done. Added to the creepiness. I was also thinking after the movie how I had never heard that name before, and it is probabley because they wanted to pick some obscure name so no little girl would think she was evil. I didn't like how the movie felt like it ended after she rescued Samara's body from the well. But then again the real ending was very good. But why was Samara in white, and Anne was in black? That was backwards, I thought. As some other reviewer mentioned what was with the clerk at the cabins, I would like to know that, and about the girlfriend of Noah as well. Why did it show her going up there after he died? Maybe to show that if he would have showed her the tape he would have lived. I really liked the room in the barn. And another reviewer mentioned the sounds, and I noticed throughout it sounded like there was a film projecter at different parts in the movies. Hey, how did they get a horse to swim? THAT was scarey, having a horse chasing you. Alright, this review is so random I better end it.'\n",

However, I do think I understand why so many people do. First, the movie goes out of the way to throw stylistic (no, the Seattle-area really doesn't look that depressing), creepy images that are calculated to disturb the viewer. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Second, I do think that the underlying issue is what is really giving some viewers the willies.  That issue of course, is child-abuse and murder.  Almost all of us are greatly disturbed by the very notion of abusing and killing children, the driving theme in this film. I am of the opinion, that without that element, very few viewers would have found the story as chilling as they did.  The abuse affects us (the viewer) psychologically, on a conscious or unconscious level, making us more susceptible to the dark and chilling images in the film (which in most other films would be cliche-it's hard to be truly disturbed by the murders of over-sexed teenage jerks).  Just a theory.  Feel free to shoot holes in it.**1/2 out of ****, appreciate the effort of the filmakers.'\n",

Absolutely real and urban.  I can't see these other actresses doing it.  Granted Nicole Kidman could have done the role, but the real question is, would it have been like The Others? I think she was good for that role but this role wouldn't have worked for her in the end and I think she knew that...  there is no way I could have seen Gwyneth Paltrow doing Rachel's role.Amazing.'\n",

I was fortunate to see Ringu before being blessed with a prescreening.The Ring is a GREAT movie.  The beginning one thinks is slow at first, but then thats for about three minutes.  The movie's story differs from that of the Japanese version in many ways, mainly because every other person in the original was a psychic; that wouldn't fly with the American audience much.   Despite changes in the story they have kept the drama and expanded parts in the original to really freak you out.  I just hope they don't change much in the two weeks before the movie comes out.I like this movie because at both times they were subtle things to scare ya, you didn't get to see too much, but then what you did see gave you the creeps. I slept well with Ringu and The Ring, but my friends had a hard time sleeping with The Ring.  Highly recommended.'\n",

Although it's well produced and surprisingly convincing despite it's overly fantastic premise, there are far too many contrived plot conveniences that the audience is expected to either naively accept or overlook entirely.The story involves a videotape that grants the viewer only 7 days to live after watching it. The origin of this tape is vaguely explained, but the origin of its creator is not. The audience is expected to accept--Deus Ex Machina--that the creator is simply evil, and for all intents and purposes, magic. Why the creator chooses to torment those that watch her tape is not explained. How the creator is able to kill the viewers of the tape is yet another mystery. Indeed, the mysteries build up as the movie progresses (I won't spoil the surprise by revealing these mysteries), but very few are fully explained in the end.Overall, the story is well filmed, and there are some truly unnerving scenes (my favourite involving a horse on a ferry), but there are too many unexplained plot features. Perhaps this is what happens when one builds a story around a somewhat silly premise.6 out of 10.'\n",

This is not a kind film. It does not want to reassure you.  The imagery alone is reason to see this movie, but it also is supported by a well paced mystery-plot and solidly scared acting.  The filmmaker obviously has some background in psychology, as this work twangs at that black cord inside you, giving you the most uncomfortable vibrations from scenes like a child drawing the same frantic circle over and over again, to the movement of a pen, to the sun filtering through leaves.  Even the way the movie starts...i didn't realize til later...its very sudden, like putting in a videotape that hasn't been fully rewound - a subtle touch.

Nothing could be further from the truth.  I found it to be lastingly frightening - independent of those few adrenaline moments.  (I saw it on Saturday and I'm still counting my seven days!)A few 'scare you' moments -are- part the film, but they don't carry it. They're entirely appropriate and consistent with plot elements.  The last major one (with the TV) is completely earned and still gives me chills when I think about it.The real success of this film is in its repetition of symbolic elements, its soundtrack and its use of lighting.  These build an atmosphere of dread and hopelessness not unlike that found in films such as 8mm or Industrial Symphony No. 5, or even in an H. P. Lovecraft story.  Visually, it could be compared to some of Wyeth's darker paintings, or to one of Robert Rauschenburg's moodier \"combines\".In terms of plot, the film had set me up for a very serious disappointment in its first few scenes -- starting off with all the polished teen gloss of a Wes Craven type flick.  However, it diverged from that path rather quickly, leading instead to a storyline that used elements of, but completely subverted, the now thoroughly worn out 'heros put the ghost to rest' theme.  It's about time that someone did so, and did so well, in a major film.'\n",

I also watched Ringu yesterday. My impression of Ringu is that, in comparison, it's a rawer, unfinished work. The Ring is a better movie. Ringu offers nothing extra in scares or story, and The Ring seems to pull the mystical elements together better, and benefits from higher production values and effects. Ringu was dull in one place it shouldn't have been - when they get to the well. Oh, boy, 10 minutes of them hoisting buckets of water out. The Ring was much more effective. As for those here and in the media that claim The Ring rips off other movies such as The Sixth Sense (1999) and Blair Witch (also 1999), note that RINGU was made in 1998, predating both of those, so the mystical kid and the grainy video were not copied from those movies. Many of the key images, such as of the well, and Samara walking towards & out of the TV, are right from RINGU. And, watching some of the best parts of The Ring again today, I got to say that Naomi Watts has one of THE BEST screams in movie history!'\n",

The mother did a great job, but I have to admit that her son in the film was teetering dangerously close to the 6th Sense school of child manipulation.  The story could have been much more scary if it didn't have you trying to follow the plotline.  It left me with many questions...  then watching the added features clouded things more... for those who have seen it... do you think that Mr. Morgan put the girl in the loft because he really resented her?  Just before he runs some current through his bathtub with him in it, he says \"she (his wife) wasn't supposed to be able to get pregnant\".  But in the movie, it comes out from the Dr. that they just came back with the girl, and no one knows where she came from.  I'm thinking that he resented her because 'he' wasn't responsible for her creation, and it was 'him' that wasn't supposed to provide the juice to bear children.  Leading me to believe that the wife cheated... thus explaining how much Mr. Morgan hated and resented the child.  This is the main stumbling block for me.  Otherwise I enjoyed being scared.  Some of the scenes were exceptionally well done.  It left me with a lot of questions...  I reccommend the film to anyone who likes a little scare.  Plus, the film has a nice visual style, which adds to its value.  Thanks for listening.'\n",

BEWARE Spoilers below: Someone made a comment about the blurred photos and the horse having nothing to do with the plot. I disagree. The scenes with the horse were very important to the plot. The horse sensed the evil death \"spell\" that was cast upon Rachel after watching the video. I am not a horse expert but for whatever reason the horses sensed the evil. Remember that Samara cursed her mother the same way. Anna's(the mother) horses started going crazy and were dying/killing themselves. Remember that Anna eventually killed herself as well. It was reported a suicide in the newspaper articles Rachel found, but we now know she probably died the same way both Katie and Noah did. The blurred pictures happened only to those who were \"cursed\" from watching the video. It doesn't have any HIGHER meaning other than to show that it was one of the symptoms of watching the video. It was creepy nonetheless.  The twisted faces of those that died were absolutely FREAKY. I love this movie and watching it a second time gave me more insight to what was really going on.

However, I decided to borrow and watch it. I was totally astonished. From the very beginning to the end credits I remained absorbed in the magic of this movie. Even though the plot is a bit complicated, it is imaginative and totally innovative that it can lure even the most demanding spectators. According to it, there is a videotape which if someone watches, he dies after seven days. Yeah, it may be unrealistic but very challenging as well. Isn't it? Furthermore, the direction was great.Gore Verbinski, the charismatic director of ''The ring'' managed successfully to create a gloomy atmosphere where horror and mystery are harmoniously combined. This whole situation provokes to the spectator a weird feeling of anxiety and fear for what is going to happen in the movie.Undoubtedly, the outstanding performance of Naomi Watts, who proved for one more time how talented she is, has a great impact on them too.In many cases, the spectator puts himself into her place and tries to answer the questions about the cursed videotape. The whole movie is a quest for the truth, an attempt to survive from the evil that seems to live in the tape. One of the best thriller ever, equal to the ''Silence of lambs'', with Jodie Foster, and ''Seven'', with Brad Pitt. Don't miss it!'\n",

The end of the film is great too, one of the most inventive and genuinely frightening conclusions i have ever seen.Its these final exhilarating 20 minutes that almost make you forget about the painfully slow, dull and boring middle of the film. If ever a film has drawn attention away from what in the original was a great story this is it !!! Where as the Japanese version went by with a quick pace never dwelling on small details that have little bearing on the characters the Hollywood version labors over and over. I was honestly on the verge of tears when i thought the film was concluding.However, the ending saves what for first time watchers will agree was almost one of the biggest anticlimax's ever. All in all i can only say that if Hollywood script writers are struggling with the translation from japan to USA just set it in Japan.

I think this movie puts you in the chair and while you're watching it you just can't stand, the suspense is just to attractive because you want to know why are this things happening and edition makes you ask why or what is the real thing in the mind of this terrific girl. Of course I believe the movie will not end there, the sequel must put some pieces that lack in this movie because at the end you're still trying to understand some points. The symbolism of the \"tape\" is very good because through the movie all parts of the tape are appearing and those are the pieces of the life that the girl had till end. I think the movie is well realized.'\n",

Basically it's Ring-Lite in terms of horror, but also it represents a case of trying to achieve \"more bang for your buck\" 2) Removes all internal logic present in the world of 'Ring'. What the heck was with the horses in 'The Ring' (2002)? At least Sadako's lineage (her mother has psychic abilities) goes some way toward answering questions posed by the events of the first film.I personally don't really like anything beyond 'Ring' & 'Ring 2'.'Ring 0: Birthday' humanised Sadako to such an extent, the character really doesn't scare me anymore. The mystery is gone and also I doubt anyone could fear her ever again.'Ring 2' was as far as it should have gone.No spin-offs, rip-offs or remakes.However, I await Nakata's US made 'The Ring 2' with a little more enthusiasm. Although US critics who raved about the first remake, they have been unimpressed with the sequel from what I've heard thus far.'\n",

We first saw it at my friends birthday party and i didn't find it scary at all, but i think thats because i've seen it so many times now. I have it on DVD, the special edition, with lots of special features etc. It was really good, it starts off with a really good beginning, and ends with a great ending, it keeps you in suspense and it is made really well. It's very good and it has a great story line, i couldn't wait to see the second one when i knew they were making one. I have now seen all the Japanise films of \"The Ring\" but i still think that the American one is much better. If they ever make \"The Ring 0\" I will definitely bee the first to watch it.

The cast was great in this - much better than the original Japanese version \"Ringu\".

Everything you wouldn't expect happens and the ending is twisted and equally disturbing. It just opens up a new idea for your imagination to scare the heck out of you.

Though it was very interesting that I didn't feel scared much comparing to the original one. That might be simply because that I knew the story already, but I would say the expression of horror is very different from Japaense way. As Japanese horror tends to hide the most scary part and let viewers expand their imagination to get scared, American version is more revealing the part you should get scared. The depiction of mother and child is also bit different and seemed very American to me. I thought it must be very hard to translate this Japanese way of fear into American way, but I think this gets really well translated in the end to the understandable Americanized version of the Ring. I could enjoy the movie as a totally new version.'\n",

Based on the very weird, surrealistic Japanese original, this film breaks the mold of the increasingly predictable, mega-redundant themes and settings of the horror genre in the US. Please... Visiting a good DVD rental shop with tons of horror flicks lined up together is truly depressing, so commonplace are nearly all productions from US companies.If one eliminates sci-fi \"horror\" films like the great \"Alien\" of 1979, then this film joins a very small select group, like \"Night of the Living Dead,\" the remakes of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and Carpenter's \"The Thing,\" and then moves decisively beyond them into some yet-to-be-defined new departure of eclectic imagination. Sure, a few of the scenes really stretch all credibility (as the contrived survival of a key player in one of several sequential \"endings\"), but the movement, complexity, and cast of characters in the work render this objection mostly innocuous. Strange, inexplicable occurrences simply remain flatly mysterious or ambiguous. The fly (not a spoiler). Yet the \"shocking\" scene in the scary, revelatory Edward-Munch-like house also shares in the tradition of somewhat conventional \"build-up\" scenes right out of \"The Thing.\" Finally, unlike the wonderful \"gotcha\" resolution of \"The Sixth Sense,\" this film concludes with an ominously open-ended question, actually giving the culminating terror a palpable, horrifying moral dilemma that requires no sequel whatever. This is utterly unique. And it simply isn't what American audiences pay good \"horror\" money to see, on screen or video.If this isn't a 10, folks, then I'd like to know one that's been made in the past ten years.'\n",

What happens then? When you think about it, it is a little bit unrealistic that all of the 'video' victims just happen to be at home when they are supposed to die.

            "Review: 'Did You Make a Copy? The Ring, directed by Gore Verbinski, redefines the horror storyline many people expect in movies today. This film is a remake of the Japan film The Ringu and exceeds it by far. The Ring is creepy, haunting, and mesmerizing all while staying within the PG-13 rating standards. Audiences leave the movie with a genuine feeling of fright and unease. The story follows a young woman and her son discovering a VCR tape which appears to be the cause of many frightening deaths, including the niece of the central character. After discovering her niece's boyfriend died the same night and in a similar fashion, Rachel (Naomi Watts) begins to question the nature of their fatalities. Her inquiries lead her to a mysterious tape she soon watches.Rachel then begins to research the origin of the tape, and discovers she is experiencing many of the same things she viewed on the tape. Her son Aidan (David Keller) and her close friend Noah (Martin Henderson) watch the tape also. The movie includes a viewing of the tape, and it is frightening. The images are disturbing, and the tape is grainy and surreal. It creates an overall feeling of fright. Rachel, Aidan, and Noah work towards discovering an answer for their impending deaths. This includes visiting a mental hospital and the area the tape was filmed at.The Ring is truly a unique viewing experience. I was scared of the dark for several nights after watching it. The movie depicts a frightening, unnerving story without using the usual amounts of blood, gore, and extreme frontal nudity-- all of which have become standard practice when creating a horror show. I believe this movie is astounding and should be regarded as a major motion-picture breakthrough. The Ring is in a genre of its own, delivering great screams and still staying easy on the stomachs of the viewers.'\n",

            "Review: 'I think before judging it, one should focus on the minor details to appreciate a general perfection: -----LOTS OF SPOILERS: READ THEM AFTER YOU WATCH THE MOVIE----- If you get these spoilers while watching, it is indeed a great movie: 1) After watching the video tape, all the victims turn into Samarra Morgan. In that sense, they live the very last week of Samarra she lived in the well. The coolest part is that the victims' images in cameras and pictures appear blurry and shaky because they are in water in the well, and that is how someone looks like when in water. And that is how Samarra looked like in the water before she died. Another fact that they turn into Samarra is that all the victims draw randomly with pencils on faces of themselves of other victims (Remember the journal of the first victims, all the faces were drawn on). This is in fact Samarra with her hair covering up her face. They become Samarra with the fact that Samarra's hair covers their faces in these pencil-drawings.Therefore, they have only 1 week to get out of the well and to tell what happened (that Samarra's mom killed her as she did not have any other chance) to other people if they want to survive (As in one point of the movie, Rachel clearly states that one can only survive a week in a well, and that is the time Samarra survived before dying in the well)As they become Samarra, the last thing they see would be the ring before they die after 1 week, as in the case of Samarra. And all the victims saw the ring just before they die. Another cool trick: Look at the faces of both the victims after they die (The first girl and Rachel's ex-husband at the end): They are drowned in the well, and that is why their hearts stop to beat. Their faces are blue as in the case of someone drowned in the water. And that is exactly what happened to Samarra. Remember before they die, water starts to appear in the rooms. 2) What we see in the video is everything what happened after Samarra died. Basically after she died in a week, her ghost comes out of the well and goes back to the island (and we see that in the video that the picture is first approaching the lighthouse from a distance that she is coming back). Then she brought pest to all the horses of his dad and here mom started to see her images and she commits suicide by jumping from the cliffs. The mirror image of her mom in the video is in fact looking into the camera at one point in horror, as in fact the mom sees (or notices) Samarra's ghost at that point around her. Her presence back at the island farm can also be seen in the tree carving in her barn-room. Again at one point in the movie, it was stated that in perpendicular shots towards the mirror, the camera does not appear. Basically, all these shots are what Samarra's ghost sees after she dies back in the farm. 3) The reason why she cannot sleep (the little boy repeats it continously) has also that explanation: Because she simply is in the well with water and if she sleeps, she will die. 4) Most importantly, maybe, whether Rachel and her husband uncover the truth about Samarra changed anything. My interpretation is it did not: That is exactly how the first girl died (water on the floor before she died) and that is how the ex-husband dies at the end. In both cases, they drown and in both cases Samarra walks out of the image (but the first one when the girl dies we do not see). Actually, that is also how the first other 3 victims died but when they tried to escape from that image they committed suicide.The fact is that Samarra walking out of the well happened anyway because her ghost traveled back to the island. Even though, Rachel and the ex-husband had not uncovered the truth, the ex-husband would have died the exactly the same way as it happened. ---As a non-American, I think that this movie was a great movie because of these reasons. I am not sure what you guys look in a great movie but I think if you find out the small great details after watching, the movie becomes perfect.'\n",

All too often people want to leave a movie theater unaffected and with a lucid mind. The Ring isn't the movie for you if you want to leave the cineplex with the exact attitude in which you've entered.  I won't give anything away but, you will see the contents of the video and what exactly the ring is.  This movie delivers high class chills without indulging in excessive gore.  Unlike the Sixth Sense formula, The Ring doesn't promise any surprise ending or spell-binding twists.  Instead, this film delivers a visual tilt-a-whirl of images from the moment it begins.  Director Gore Verbinski has absolutely grown as a filmmaker and The Ring is a testament to this, with it's crisp, often dazzling imagery.  Naomi Watts, fresh off her amazing performance in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, creates a vivid heroine, yet we never really see her desperation enough.  When the details of the movie are revealed, you'll probably agree.  Although the performances in the film are at times campy, the film provides an intricate storyline that will have you going \"What the hell was that?\" or \"What's going on?\"  It's a very high concept for a commercial film, which is refreshing after all of the Triple X's and Scorpion King's of the summer: a settling movie to enter Autumn with.

So I went to watch the American version with high hope, and unfortunately, though predictably, it turned out to be a complete let down. The atmosphere of the original version, which was what made the movie oh-so scary, was almost completely wiped out in the American version by all the visual and sound effects.  In fact, the quietness in the Japanese version creates the atmosphere and gives you an extra level of horror because you just don't know what to expect next.  (SPOILER) I just can't stand the fact that in \"The Ring\", the TV chases Naomi Watts and pushes her into the well.(END SPOILER)I'll recommend \"The Ring\" to those of you who haven't watched either version.  If you've watched \"The Ring\", I strongly recommend you to watch \"Ringu\" as well.  If you've watched \"Ringu\" but not \"The Ring,\" don't bother.  It's nothing comparing to the original one.'\n",

And a pointless remake at that. Sure, the effects are better, but that's to be expected as they probably had ten times the budget.The story is simple, yet intriguing. A couple of teenagers have died. Separately, but all at the same day, and at the exact same time. Rachel Keller starts investigating the events and finds out that they had all been in a cabin watching a videotape seven days earlier, and as rumour has it; everyone that watches that tape, dies seven days later.My recommendation is to see the original, Ringu. As least start with that one and watch this afterwards, if you must. I saw Ringu about 2 months ago, and in my opinion it was darker, scarier, and made me think more. The remake does the classic Hollywood thing; they explain too much as if we, the audience, as incapable of independent thought. I like a movie that makes me think, and leaves me wondering a bit. That's always a good reason to see a movie for a second, or third time.But, honestly, I can't be sure what I would have thought if I had seen The Ring before Ringu.Anyway, if you don't have some strange phobia about seeing subtitled movies, try to get hold of Ringu, Ringu 2 and the prequel Ringu 0: Baasudei (Birthday).

The scripting was a little ramshackle, but overall a very refreshing and genuinely creepy li'l pic.  Production design was appropriately water-logged--everything from Morgan's death to the psychiatric hospital records room felt distinctly wet.  Acting was descent at worst, with some genuinely good moments.As far as the overall movie, very stylishly done.  Verbinski and the DoP's subliminal-quick scattering of images from the Tape were very well executed, setting the viewer a bit more on edge.  Daveigh Chase's performance as Samara was downright chilling.  Very nice to see elements for the original \"Ringu\" in the film as well: spatterings of japanese imagery, and Samara's final emergence to kill Noah was straight out of Nakata's minor masterpiece.As far as the ending, I didn't find it a false end in the least.  The \"first\" ending was pretty much a carbon copy of every tripe-tossed modern ghost story--\"the horribly wronged, murderous ghost does all it's horribly wrong murders just to get someone to solve the mystery of its horribly wrong death\"....which is, overall, horribly wrong.  It then turns that sucker on it's ear with one line from little Aidan: \"You helped her?\".  Just a bit of a jab at all the feel-good happy endings infecting modern horror.  It's a bit of a stretch to convince me that an already disturbed child left for dead )for a week before dying) at the bottom of a well by her mother would be satisfied by someone simply finding her body.

I love movies, scary, thrillers, gore, I love them all. I would say I'm pretty jaded with scary movies and don't get scared easily anymore, but I still watch them for the fun. I rented Ringu and watched it alone one night. And it creeped the hell out of me. Since then, I've recommended it to everyone I know. It's not at every video store, so you'll have to search for it. In SF, it's at LeVideo. Anyway, I was excited about the remake, esp. since it was starring one of my new favorite actresses, Naomi Watts. I was kind of upset of the PG13 rating. Well, I can tell you...it was still creepy, very faithful, and a job well done. I hope it becomes a huge hit, it deserves to be seen by a lot of people, and that it doesn't get ignored. The filmmakers should be very proud. As in the original, there is no blood, no gore, just images and trippy visuals that will make you look in awe and mezmerize you. You're involved right away in this tape and you want to know what it's all about.  Not all remakes are good at all, this one is really really good. I hope you all see it. But if you want a real creep out, find the original.'\n",

It takes a pretty awful movie to have a person wishing he were in class. The only thing effective in this movie were the \"shockers\"--the cut to scenes that began with a loud noise.  At least i jumped.  Otherwise this was a moronic movie with a convoluded storyline that made no sense.  And as others have noted, the ending was so completely forced that i wanted to force a pencil through my head.  So completely forced that i felt the need to use a stupid play of words. The sad thing was that the movie had true potential.  But all it did was sit in front of me saying, \"Hello, i'm a psychological thriller.  I want to play with your head and make you scared.\"  But it takes more than that to scare a person. Just as in some suspensful movies, the suspenseful moments are overplayed to the point that they aren't truly suspenseful.  The Ring suffered this same problem: scary moments were so played up that they ceased to be scary and caused me to laugh. To be honest the acting is really not too shabby.  Its good, really.  But it was wasted on a poorly executed flick. Time to research the Japanese version to see if it avoided the pitfalls of the American show.'\n",

The fact that there are so many people who are raving about this just proves that people have different tastes, which is fine, but it still baffles me. I don't understand how this is scaring people. And I really think that all the people that are talking about it being \"intellectual\" and having \"layers\" are just trying to sound intellectual themselves, and hide the fact that either they didn't get it, or they understand that there was no plot but feel the need to act like there was.

            "Review: 'When I saw the original Ringu, I was watching it in the dark, by myself. I got absolutely no sleep that night, and I am not someone who scares easily. I am a big fan of horror, but have trouble being scared by most modern Hollywood horror movies. This is because most of them have shallow plots and rely on cheap jumps for their scares. To get someone to truly be afraid, you have to draw them into the movie. It's easy to just think, \"Oh, this is just a movie, that giant bug isn't real, I'd never get attacked by that.\" The truly scary horror movie is the one that grabs you, and just won't let go; you can't forget that it's just a movie. That's just what this movie does.I have to compare the original to the American version, because in doing so you see why both are effective. First off, they both have that \"grab you\" quality. They do this by empathy, both by the familiarity of a story that sounds like an urban legend (the tape that kills you) and by the fact that you actually watch the tape when they do. How better to have someone interested in how the characters are going to save themselves then by convincing the irrational part of the brain that horror caters to that it could happen to them?As far as the actual horror of the movie, I prefer Ringu, as it was  more suspenseful, with more Hitchcock like pacing, building of tension and shots. The Ring has quite a few cheap jumps that annoyed me. This can work once, but it's overused and unneccesary, especially because the original is so suspenseful, the American version shouldn't need them. I can see why they would add this, as American audiences tend to have much shorter attention spans, so if you don't shock them once in awhile, you lose them. It still has the suspense of the original, so no great harm is done. The main thing that bothered me with the new version was that it had to change so many things for American audiences. The reason that this bothered me is that the Japanese version made much more sense. The American version, by comparison seemed a little bit slapped together, but it's still very good. Also, the very end of the original was a good bit more chilling than the new one.All that aside, I'm not saying that the new version is without its merits. For one thing, the effects are much better, and there are some that kinda make you go, \"Oh my god, that's not supposed to happen,\" outloud in the theater that aren't in the original. There's also little subtle tricks that work quite well that are unique to the American version.Overall, both are excellent movies. Even though the American version isn't quite as good as the original, it still runs rings (no pun intended) around most of the competition out there. Definitely watch the American version, and it'd be worth your while to track down the original. That is, if you don't mind missing a night's sleep! :^)'\n",

If you haven't seen it yet, and would like to pay money to be disappointed, stop reading here to avoid the ***SPOILERS***Unfortunately The Ring tried to give a complex plot to a dull shock movie. It certainly made me think, but the more I thought about it, the more questions arose:1)The end reaveals that Samara comes to kill her victims through the TV 7 days after watching the tape, but how did she kill the two teenagers who were driving in the car?2)It is established throughout the movie that Samara never sleeps, but Aidan tells us that \"the horses keep her up at night.\"  Since she never sleeps, this wouldn't be a problem.3)When Aidan  watched the tape, the end shows Samara's arm coming over the top of the well.  This is not on the original tape, as this is the beginning of Samara's appearance when she comes to kill her victims.\n",
            "4)The end of the movie implies that copying the tape (and showing it to someone else) saves you from death on the 7th day.  Rachel had already made a copy and Aidan had seen it by the time she and Noah are in the cabin. But the TV turns on and the water appears, signaling Samara's appearance, which should not happen if copying was actually the immunity from the certain death.I know there were other points that bothered me in this movie, but I have tried to put them out of my mind, and have included the biggest ones here. For a horror movie, I enjoyed the shock scenes and overthetop settings, but the plot too obviously paves the way for a sequel... The End? (sigh)'\n",

Often called the Japanese equivalent to Stephen King, he masterfully delivers a stunning story through eerie visualization and plot twists. Verbinski brought his vision to the screen masterfully, and though I've heard it falls short of the Japanese original, I hesitate to say it falls short at all! In fact the mood and cinematography he brings to the story makes it that much more scary. When I saw \"Dark Water\" this last summer, I was moved for days by the story. I saw \"The Ring\" on a whim, saw the similarities to \"Dark Water\" and wondered...I confirmed when I got home and did some research on the internet that Kôji Suzuki did write it!

            "Review: 'In my opinion, Hollywood has either had a difficult time getting horror movies right through the 1990's or reality for some of us has become much more frightening.  Some of the more recognizable films such as the \"Scream\" and the \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" films failed to scare me like \"The Exorcist\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" did, due mainly to predictability.  I find it ironic that in this time period, when most of us are still shaken by recent events, that we are given two of the scariest movies in awhile; \"Signs\" and \"The Ring\". \"The Ring\" is  beautifully rendered film.  The cinematography and attention to detail is first rate, clearly the cast and crew had a lot of respect for the story since the film didn't look as though it was just rushed for Halloween.  The actual video that is killing off people in the film has got to be the scariest short film that I've ever seen. The combination of the visuals and the sound effects are something you don't want in you head when walking down a poorly lit street at night alone.  Creating this kind of fear in a film isn't easy, especially without blood, gore and excessive violence, none of which are in the film. I thought the story was pretty original.  A journalist (Naomi Watts) has seven days to figure out how a videotape is killing off those who watch it before she and her son, both of whom have already watched it, are killed.  One of the best things about the plot and the way that it unfolds is that, unlike a lot of Hollywood films, it doesn't spell everything out for the viewer.  It allows room for the viewer to figure out certain things for him/herself without leaving massive plotholes or ending up the result of lazy writing.  Like a sculpture or a painting, everyone who sees this will have their own interpretation of how certain events occurred in the film, thus making the audience think and keeping the film in their heads for awhile. One element that will determine how much people will enjoy or be frightened by this film are their beliefs.  Some of my friends didn't enjoy Signs because it dealt with two things that they didn't believe in, aliens and religion.  The Ring deals somewhat with the afterlife. I might be wrong in assuming this, but I think that if you're an individual who only believes in things that you can physically interact with as opposed to an person who believes in things that you can't see or hear, then some of the subject matter in both films may seem laughable.  The subject matter may also seem funny if reality for you is, or has been, more frightening than the film itself. Regardless of the above, The Ring isn't just a good horror movie, but a great film.  I do get the impression that we may see a R Rated version on DVD next year as it appeared to look as though they were holding back a little on the gore.  I might be wrong.'\n",

I know it's just a typical scary movie.  I think the reason I am still mad about it is that somany people encouraged me to go see it and it has made way too much money for the quality. Maybe if I was a girl in junior high or something, I MIGHT like it then.  Too slow, too ridiculous, and too annoying for me.  My fellow IMDB voters- I know the only reason this is getting such a high voting is b/c of blurred vision and people who don't know movies like \"we veteran\" movie goers do.  To all of the \"amateurs\" who also probably liked kung pao of supernova:  stop voting- you are ruining the prestige and honor of IMDB and the rest of the \"casablanca\" top of the class movie guru's.Thank You...I feel so much better now.'\n",

Regardless, I still feel obligated to say my peace.  I will not go into the specific details as to whether you should see it or not. I don't know your tastes.  All I can say is I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It made the hair stand up on my neck in many instances, and regardless of any plot holes, that's essentially the point of horror movies. How often do horror movies have an air tight script?  Does that add to the joy and campiness of scary movies?  Perfection is a feat rarely achieved regardless of any genre.  I will not reveal anything, just don't attempt to make the movie something it isn't.  Just go to get creeped out and realize that senseless scare tactics are often thrown only to assist the plot at moving along.  This movie has an intensity and creepiness about it and it's the idea that really matters.  I also loved how this movie didn't crap itself out at the end like most new horror movies.  Yes, the middle ran drab and gave you a sense of deceiving finality, but it ripped that from our hands and redeemed itself with a genuine classic ending.  This movie was consistent straight through.  Yes, it had it's problems, but so does every movie and if you pick apart this movie; or any for that reason. I can't imagine what you deem as good.  If you like horror movies (this is a statement only for the truest fans) then you should enjoy this movie. Don't expect much and don't tear it apart and you should be pleased to relax and let the atmosphere drag you in.'\n",

This may have been it if it wasn't for all the patched together scenes that did not make sense The character of Aidan was seriously underdeveoloped and reminded me of a rip off of Cole from \"The Sixth Sense\", only much less believable.  I suppose this is one of those old movies that is supposed to make you guess what happens for yourself.  What really happens is an assortment of scenes that are added only to make the movie scarier but have no meaning.I'd like to know the answer to the following questions: ***SPOILERS*** If the kid knew this girl was evil, why didn't he keep his mother from helping her? What was the point of showing Noah's girlfriend, she did absolutely nothing to contribute to the movie. In the day of cameras built into cell phones, why didn't anyone have an answering machine? If the tape was that bad, why didn't Rachel hide it from her young child instead of leaving it in the VCR? What was the deal with Aidain looking at that stranger on the street, it had nothing to do with the movie. Why did Mr Morgan wait 20 years to commit suicide, in front of Rachel, and why did he decide to plug every appliance in the house into the BATHROOM? Was the girl evil or a product of evil? Why did the mother kill her daughter?  To protect her or to get rid of her? Why didn't the psychologist on the island NOT see images? What was the point of showing her autistic grandson? Why show Rachel in the shower with blood swirling down the drain, where did the blood come from? How did she get an electrode in her throat? Why did she keep focusing in on that stupid fly, even in scenes before she pulled it out of the screen? Why did all the dead people (who only died of heart failure but looked like they were decomposed) look exactly like Linda Blair in the Exorcist? The horse sub-plot was completely goofy as well. Who made the tape?   The end of the movie I didn't even care anymore, I just wanted it to end because it didn't make sense.

The opening sequence was somewhat predictable (scary, but predictable), but for me, that was where the film took a very dark turn. I have been a horror movie fan for years, and have NEVER covered my eyes, or looked away from a horror film EVER. This film scared me. There were several parts where I was unable to look directly at the screen. I actually COVERED my eyes. The spliced in frames of 'the ring' flashing on the screen stayed with me for the entire next day. It didn't have that great of a script, but I thought the actors did well with what they had. I was alittle disappointed with the ending, but overall I was so affected by this that I almost had nightmares. My wife thought it was so funny that I was scared that she set up a little joke to play on me right before I was about to fall asleep. She chose a blank channel on the tv in our bedroom (yes, snow and white noise) and hid the remote under her pillow, turning on the tv as I was just drifting off. Funny, right?

The scene that considered a bit scarier than \"today world\" in this movie is that when the ghost crawls out of the television screen [don't know if the US version includes that scene as well]. Hopefully, the US version will be more scary, and it should be better than the Japanese one, since you don't have to catch the subtitle all the time and miss all the scary parts should there be any. But come to think, Japan is leading the trend of entertainment around the world in the past decade: Playstation 1 & 2, Nintendo, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, etc. Now they are \"invading\" the traditional US dominated movie market. Thus I predict that this movie will gain a big load in the box office. But not all people will like it, since sushi isn't tasty for everyone.'\n",

But the pacing and the story needed work.  For those who do not know, this movie is a remake of a 1999 Japanese Film called Ringu.  If you combined the pacing and story of Ringu with the casting and setting of this movie you would have an awesome movie.  The Story?  But it's a remake, it has the same story doesn't it?  Well, yes and no.  While it has the same premise, and even the same twists, the Japanese original is much more streamlined, and more vague at times.  How is this better?  Well it lends more suspense and more mystery, more creepiness to the whole thing. Believe it or not, sometimes less is more, and that is certainly the truth with Ringu.  That does not mean that this film is bad though.  It has it's own creepiness, and its own mood.  Naomi Watts is awesome, and David Dorfman as her son is terrific.  This movie comes off mostly as a mystery and not horror, although that is also true of the original, this version almost reminds me of \"The Lady in White\" for some reason. Horror, but horror based in mystery.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has not seen the original and is looking for a good suspense/mystery.  Avid horror fans should seek out the original, and much more scary Ringu.'\n",

It was horrible and do not recommend it to anyone.  I kept hearing from critics and friends that the videotape in the movie was very \"disturbing & creepy\".  Well, there was a bit of creepiness to it, but it was definitely not disturbing.  It looked like a NIN video without the music.  Random images that seemed to not make any sense.  What we learn later in the movie, is that these images are all clues to solving the mysterious tape.  Unfortunatley, it has nothing to do with what the audience is looking forward to...how to live past the seven days.We learn that the tape is really a recording of a murdered girls brain activity from a psychiactic session.  In essense, the subconscience of a mental and mysterious young girl.  Her name, Samara, is even odd.  She was adopted by a couple who raised horses and lived with them until she started to act odd.  They sent her to the head doctors and was brought back only to be cast away in a barn.  Her mother, Anna, was also mentally disturbed. It reminded me of post martum depression.  Anyway, she ends up throwing Samara down a well where she last 7 days until she dies.  The Ring is actually the mouth of a stone well with a giant plug over it.What made me hate this movie is the cheesey dialogue.  One good example was when they finally figure out that the girl was trapped in a well.  Noah (Rachels ex) asks \"how long can someone live in a well\", Rachel replies \"seven days\".  This may not seem cheesey, but by this time you've heard the phrase \"seven days\" enough to vomit.  You could see that reply coming from day 1.The only redeeming thing about this movie is at the end, when she (Samara) comes out of the TV.  That was pretty creepy, and they should of had more of that.  They should have had more of the kid, Aidan.  He could of been used much more effectively in creating a scary atmosphere.  In my opinion, there should have been more deaths, and the creepy girl should have been used more.  I thought the movie was solved once Rachel picked the fly off of the TV.  A cool effect, but it gave away too much.  At the end, I just didn't care about the characters or the tape.'\n",

Oh, and let it just be known that I could care less about box office figures, (although they kicked ass this weekend) nor do I care about what those who call themselves movie critics say. These things have never, ever dictated my choice in moviegoing. This is merely MY opinion of this movie. Period. I've not seen the original, and I know nothing about this movie other than what I saw on Saturday night, capice?That said, all you purists out there who pride themselves on the fact on how you have \"read the book\", or those who have seen the Japanese version and hate the US version and those who get their underwear all twisted up about the motives of a director and dialogue and the way certain scenes are shot in such and such film - more power to you, but please, give a sister a break, aight?Again- DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE. There are probably going to be some spoilers that will ruin it for you. Last chance....Cast/Acting: No matter what we would like to believe about ourselves or about what \"real\" people look like, eye candy is a love/hate thing. Naomi Watts stars in this movie as Seattle newspaper reporter and mother to 6-year old son, Rachel Keller. Watts not only played her part well as did everyone else, but she did so with class and a subtle style that didn't seem overly immersed in the fact that she's gorgeous. Newcomer (I guess?) Martin Hendersen plays Noah, the father of Rachel's son Aidan (acted with well-done intensity by a young David Dorfman) with rugged good looks and gorgeous blue eyes who partners with her in trying to unravel the mystery behind the videotape.Otherworldly gorgeous Rachel Bella (Becca) and willowy Amber Tamblyn (Katie) are the ill-fated teenagers who kick off the first body count scene. Their friends are equally sublime in the looks department, as we later find out when Rachel not-so-casually smokes a cigarette with them outside, while looking for some answers during Katie's wake. This is the one time I was most distracted by the eye candy. One would think all teenagers were supermodels. At least the ones in this flick were. Even Daveigh Chase, who played the evil little girl, Samara, was stunning.Casting was well constructed and the acting jobs, although not Oscar caliber (and what horror flick other than Silence of the Lambs is ever recognized by the Academy anyway, really) were solid.Plot: A videotape containing disturbing \"footage\" that literally frightens it's viewers to death 7 days after they view it. The sudden and unexplained deaths of several teenagers including her niece and the desperate pleas of her sister who has lost her daughter and is still searching for answers sends a young mother/reporter on a mission to find out the cause.\n",

Horses going mad and becoming suicidal, stuff about the relationship between Rachel and Noah that the viewer is never given, unanswered questions about who actually put the footage on the tape, how it got there, and how it originated, etc. Is the fly real? Is the girl actually inside the videotape? Lots of preposterous fantasy stuff only movies can get away with, of course. But the entire layout is a bit of a mind****, which, in a sense is good. However, there are large holes, which don't usually sit well with me.Location/Sets: Seattle has my heart in so many ways. I really enjoyed the gloom and the rain, which is to a scary movie as flour is to a cake. The sets were done very well. A big spooky barn, lots of water, not an overabundance of long, dark hallways or creaky staircases that usually up the cheese factor. Pretty straightforward, realistic and believable. Although the apartment building Rachel lives in with her son made me feel very claustrophobic and dizzy. Not much else to say here.Fear Factor: On a scale of 1-10, I'd give this movie a solid 8. There were several cheap shots where the scene would be very quiet and then suddenly a loud BANG! or a scene change would startle you, but the most frightening element was the tension and the waiting, I think. Everyone was waiting to see what would happen on the 7th day...Best Scene: Definitely, without a doubt, the best and most terrifying scene is the grand finale. This is the most climactic scene, which takes place in Noah's loft. He's still trying to sort out the details and come to terms with things when his television set mysteriously turns itself on, and that foreboding static fills the screen. On the screen, he sees Samara climbing slowly out of the stone well where he and \"Rachel\" assumed was her final resting place. Her hair is hanging in wet, swollen tangles over her face, and her shoulders crack and she lurches forward like a bloodthirsty zombie in her dripping, filthy dress. He can't move from his chair or tear his eyes from the television screen as it begins to flood the floor with water. He lunges to get away but stumbles backwards, smashing into some shelves and onto the floor.At some point, Noah scrambles back into the chair, still watching with eyes wide open, his body frozen in fear. Slowly and deliberately, Samara's arm comes through the screen and stretches to the floor as the rest of her hideous limbs come through and take form. The mere sight of her becoming life-size before him and then finally the horrifying vision of her sends him into a full-scale panic attack, literally scaring him to death. This scene was chilling beyond description and it's definitely what you remember most when you leave the theater... as well as when you try to fall asleep that night.Details/Moments Noted: Katie's face in the closet. The horse on the ferry that leapt to it's drowning death - very disturbing. The electrocution scene. The discovery of the Samara's loft in the barn. The endless entrail-like organ coming out of the screaming throat. The videotape sequence itself. And, of course, the scene with Samara emerging from the well - creep city.One part of the movie that did stand out in my mind was a particular scene in which Rachel is standing on her balcony. She somewhat voyeuristically scans the interiors of several apartments and their residents as life goes on inside each living space. She notices how many televisions are in the homes of these people, and how they are being used. One woman sneaks outside to her balcony to smoke while her child sits in front of the television. Someone confined to a wheelchair eats his dinner in front of his television. Another person has a television on his bureau, near his bed. It's as though the message here is that television is the enemy, and not the videotape or the deaths that are resulting from the footage therein. Interesting metaphor, anyway, although I'm not sure who was trying to make the point or why.Recap: Good stuff. Worth the ridiculous price of movies these days, I suppose. Better in the theater than on video for the fun of sharing the screams and chills with others. Although I guess I can almost go with the PG-13 rating, I didn't see one kid under 16 in that theater and I have to agree, I think it's a little too much for kids under 16.'\n",

The Ring is well made, and decently acted, but like The Cell, the 'look' of the film is what is most appealing.After seeing it I saw the original Japanese film from 1998. The Japanese version (Ringu) told a similar story but without some of the touches Gore Verbinski used to appeal to Western audiences. Ringu was much more subtle about revealing the secrets of the tape while Ring is a little more blatant about some things, like the 'seven days' revelation near the end. I thought it was a very disturbing and original film. The people who think The Ring is stealing ideas from Feardotcom or some PS2 game obviously don't realize where the concept started.'\n",

But it isn't going to love you back, as you are going to exit the theater with major goosebumps.For those who don't want too many spoilers: It's creepy, it'll get to you, you'll want to analyze it to death afterwards. Now go see it.(spoilers ahead) The Ring is a remake of the Japanese blockbuster Ringu. The only thing that the American version has extra in it is the relation to horses.The Japanese Ringu already has several sequels. But now with the relation to horses and with the scenes at the asylum with the x-rays of the horses, along with several other scenes in the movie, an intresting conclusion might lead to a very creepy sequel.Since Samara's mother (Anna) was not able to conceive a child, perhaps Richard Morgan wanted to give her the greatest gift of all, a child. And in his desperation to give them the only thing needed to reach perfect happiness was through invitro. Only, he impregnated not a human carrier, but a mare (female horse). Noone knew until the mare gave birth. Anna found out, went bananas and threw herself off a cliff. And obviously Samara wasn't all 1+1 either. She turned out to have special powers, alongside a twisted personality. And those powers only grew ripe when she got killed.Put together (day)dreams, horses and a monster. What do you get?Incubus/succubus: A demon; a fiend; a lascivious spirit, supposed to have sexual intercourse with women by night.(male form) The devils who appeared in the female form were generally called succubi; those who appeared like men incubi, though this distinction was not always preserved. They were also known to evoke TERRIFYING DREAMS. In other words: -nightmares-.Here is where American bases screenwriters can take off and leave the original scrips behind, and make it worthwhile to have made a remake of the first Ringu.Would be nice to see a 'The Ring' meets 'Exorcist' meets 'Nightmare on Elm Street''\n",

Then, the white noise on the screen in front of them immediately fills the full frame of the movie, getting louder, and then we are assaulted with a quick succession of flashed, one-frame images and then total blackness, is if the screen suddenly came alive in the theatre.The implication is that we are the people who saw the copy. It was shown in its entirety to we, the viewers, when Rachel sat down to watch it.

On the whole it was pretty successful.  It was well acted and directed with a few good jumps but the film does have its faults.  In my opinion it had a tendancy to rely on the jump shock with a loud noise rather than just let us get involved in the atmosphere.  The horse sub-plot was a disaster and pointless.  The child was just a left over from the sixth sense and not just a normal child as he was in the original.  It also tried to answer too many questions.  What is it with american films?  Why do they have to try to explain everything?  I don't need to be told all the answers. It's nice to be able to think for yourself.

            "Review: 'This is a peculiar remake. During the towering heights of Hollywood westernising world-renowned Asian horrors, mostly from Japan and South Korea, Japanese director Ochiai opted to alter the story of Thailand's arguably most famous eponymous horror with American actors, set in Japan. Western audiences apparently wouldn't be spooked if the ghost haunting the main characters wasn't a pasty white Japanese girl with luscious black hair and masses amount of eye liner. It's a cluster of cultures, and whilst the end result isn't exactly terrible, it's far from being tolerably good. Because much like 'The Grudge', 'One Missed Call' and 'Pulse', the underlying sense of pointlessness becomes an overburden for everyone involved.A photographer and his new bride travel to Tokyo where they accidentally smash into a girl standing in the middle of the darkened misty road (bare foot, might I add!). And so, through the ominous power of spirit photography, they become haunted. Specks of mysterious white vapours and the glistening sunlight against the camera lenses, being interpreted as ghostly entities attempting to communicate with the living. \"The dead latch onto the flesh\".Without changing the essence of the overall story too much, just minor details here and there, Ochiai manages to produce various suspenseful moments through the usage of anonymity. The ethereal cries of a haunting girl, the innocent humming of an eerie song and the most intense tonguing since Toad got struck by lightning back in '00. The supernatural elements work best when nothing is showed on screen. The dark room sequence when Megumi entered the room, although initially presumed to be Jane, was executed with enough slow-paced tension to become effective. Dropping a splinter of wood into a solution that causes a tsunami into the eyes? Ineffective. Electrocuting one's self in a desperate attempt to rid the latched ghost? Well, I don't need to tell you how stupid that is.Dawson's script is less than impressive. Masses amount of exposition and one-dimensional development that forced characters to be nothing more than tourists and amateur photographers. Seriously, Jane is the worst tourist. Shouting in the faces of locals exclaiming \"excuse me, where do I go!?\". Is she oblivious to native languages? Like, she failed to even attempt one word in Japanese. That's not Taylor's fault, who isn't the most talented actress in existence, but managed to bring out some surprising emotionality towards the film's conclusion. Jackson on the other hand? Ehhh. He's the kind of guy you want to slap for acquiring no personality. Just bland. His character's best friends are pointless and sadly resorted to expendable deaths that suffered from no build-up.The central mystery that powers the narrative does captivate, even if Ochiai's direction made certain twists obvious due to extensive foreshadowing, and that's the primary element for preventing this remake from venturing into the realms that we do not speak of. I'm looking at you 'One Missed Call' and 'Pulse'!So yes, Shutter is fine. As a film, it functions by itself with enough flash for the uninitiated. However, for those who have watched the original, you're bound to find disfigurement within the composition of this photographic remake.'\n",

This Onryō could very well have a reason for showing up (and ruining) Jackson's photographic sessions with models in/outdoors, as well as, constantly turning up to haunt them. It seems Jackson and Denman (and also their mutual friend, played by John Hensley) eventually recognize exactly who this spirit is and why she is hanging around to remind them of past sins. Formulaic, dull plotting (the sheen had then worn off the allure of American remakes of Asian horror so popular in the late 90s/early 2000s by 2008), and a severe lack of imagination leave this remake dying on the screen without much to grab us. An image of why Jackson feels such a weight on his shoulders seems to be one of the few scenes (I also dug the scene where Taylor visits the magazine popular for showing (and creating, especially) spirit photography, and is shown a room with authentic photographs of specters on film) that leave an impression at all, but even it has been better executed before. You can just revisit (or watch for the first time) the Thai Shutter film and experience better creeps than what are available in this uninspired remake. One of the shining examples of how remaking past films over a period of time can numb the senses of horror fans, eventually draining our desire to even watch their Asian counterparts. The finale, where Jackson goes to great lengths to remove what is haunting him, is the death knell in this rather worthless remake. Taylor tries her best to encourage our sympathies for her difficult situation (not of her making; she's a victim of circumstance, unaware of what her husband done), but her character is basically reactionary, while Jackson bores with a performance and character that aren't able to rise above the material. Encountering a dead body with flies out her mouth may be the lone scary scene in the whole film.'\n",

This is not always a good thing as it's these little things that give the story a bit of character and individuality.To be brief, the story involves the haunting of an American photographer and his new wife in Japan after hitting a young woman with their car on a lonely country road.Most of the ghostly horror is more suggested than overt, with images appearing in photographs and just out of direct sight. Most of the set pieces from the original are here, but several of the most startling and effective moments of horror are missing. The unfortunate PG-13 rating keeps everything in check, so, while compelling, the horror is fairly muted. Another fault is the ghost lacks a bit of the personality the original has in spades. The final twist takes the story in a very different direction and is quite startling. But, like another reviewer wrote, leaves you feeling justice has been done.Not a great film, but very watchable and satisfying.'\n",

            "Review: 'Someone remind me what's the point of a remake again? A dearth of ideas? Thinking that one can do the job better? Don't laugh but one of the better Asian horror I've seen (probably amongst the first few too in recent years) was the Thai movie Shutter, which played on the plot device of spirit photography, those strange streaks of blurs that cover weird angles in a photograph, and with a vivid imagination, you can even make out faces of people you know, or know not.There are remakes which challenge on the technical fronts - having to recreate scenes shot by shot, or those helmed by master directors in the hopes of injecting some depth into characterization and story. Some filmmakers even choose to remake their own films with a different cast (Funny Games anyone?), and the list goes on. But one thing's for sure, I seriously hope that the number of Asian horror remakes start to dwindle, given that the westernized versions pale in comparison to their Asian originals, and Shutter happens to be one of them.OK, so perhaps half the fun was eliminated when you know just about every plot twist and turn, character motivation, and probably even what dialogue will come out of the actor's mouths (so I jest). But in all earnestness, I reckon that this remake will appeal more to those who have not seen the original. It's easy to be thoroughly bored because you know just what's about to come, and can eliminate red herrings, as well as spot the now-so-obviously subtle hints that the characters try to hide unsuccessfully.Also, you can bet your last dollar that Hollywood will again go over the top in trying to explain everything verbatim, as well as attempting to up the ante with the finale, but in doing so, tried too hard. I do not deny that it was much needed tension too little too late toward the end, but really, it added nothing to the plot besides succeeding in making you squirm. Technically this remade version boasts nicer production values, but lacked the edginess that the original had to offer, well, because the directing duo of Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom were rookies then, and lacked certain horrific charm and soul (pardon the pun). In fact, there was one critical scene which the Thai version had which boasted some ingenuity in a tracking shot, but one which the remake had chickened out to do, opting instead for cheap CG and unnecessary cut-shots.So the remade had blinked first, and didn't offer any really frightening moments to genuinely scare. Somehow I thought it was rather subtly pre-occupied with sex, given that you have a great looking cast with Joshua Jackson as Benjamin Shaw the photographer, and his newly wedded wife Jane Shaw, played by Rachael Taylor. For some reason, Japan gets automatically associated with Asian horror, and that's where this remake was set in, maybe because the director - Masayuki Ochiai - is Japanese too.But the final straw which I found really disturbing, was the lack of acknowledgement that this is a remake. There's nothing in the opening credits to inform the audience that it is one (the original Thai directors given only producers credits), and probably tried to pass off as an original story. Recommended of course to those who have not seen the original (even then I'd suggest you only watch the Thai version). Those who have, are advised to steer clear.'\n",

That's not to say that it's genuinely decent on its own merits if you've not already seen 2004's seminal Thai-horror \"Shutter\" that reignited that country's interest in producing slow burning, luxuriously made horror films. Interestingly, and perhaps even fittingly, the Hollywood machine that devours and regurgitates the recent slate of J-Horror films has turned its sights on \"Shutter\", which arguably finds its core roots in Japan's horror conventions in its vengeful, waifish ghost girl tormenting the living by manifesting through various electronic mediums. So what Masayuki Ochiai's adaptation essentially becomes is a carbon copy of copy.American photographer Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his blonde schoolteacher bride Jane (Rachael Taylor) go straight from nuptials to a working honeymoon in Japan, natch, because America just isn't as scary to Americans as Asia is. Before heading off to Ben's lucrative assignment in Tokyo, the newly minted couple heads to a remote countryside inn when a brief accident derails Jane's constitution and compels her to seek out answers led by a phantasmal presence in photographs and a newly discovered knowledge of spirit photography.Unremarkably, Luke Dawson's screenplay omits and appends details to its basic premise. The original uses the stark disassociation of city living to intensify the eeriness of isolation, and the idea that we never really see what we think we know. Dawson's script transplants the couple to a different country, ramping up the cultural alienation and exoticism of another culture. It's not dissimilar to what we've already seen in \"The Grudge\" remakes.Even as Ochiai's direction is comparatively surefooted and patient with the camera choosing to hang on to a scene instead of ludicrously harping on jump-cuts and eyeball-rattling shots that bounce off the wall, the film feels unambitiously stale. \"Shutter\" goes through the motions of dourly checking off look-behind-you set pieces and reflections on windows. The plotting and performances are so apparent; you'd find yourself a couple of steps ahead of the film's central faux-mystery. While the bizarre symbiotic relationship audiences have with particularly mediocre remakes of Asian horror films should still live on after this, what remains most terrifying is how textbook simple and undemanding the film-making has become for films of its ilk.'\n",

I didn't bother to see it when it initially got released because there already was an overload of Asian Ghost movies at that time and I really couldn't cope enduring another dull and scare-free imitation of \"Ringu\". After seeing the US remake I'm definitely interested in checking out the original sooner or later. The basic idea of restless spirits trying to communicate through photography is remotely original, but the elaboration (at least in this remake) remains somewhat tedious and predictable. Immediately after their marriage, Jane follows her photographer husband Ben to Tokyo where his friends arranged a splendid job for him. Jane, but soon after also Ben, suffers from visions of a deceased girl and all the pictures they make are ruined by ghostly images of this same girl. There's more than obviously a link between this girl and Ben's past days as a bachelor, but Jane only gradually learns the truth of what happened exactly. To my knowledge, this is the first and so far only Thai film to be remade by a Japanese director but with American funds and cast members. Talk about an international co-production! Masayuki Ochiai previously directed the incredibly atmospheric and uncanny hospital-horror film \"Infection\", so he definitely knows how to build up suspense and terror through suggestion. The main problem here is that the ghostly subject matter is too \"soft\" and doesn't lend itself to provide some genuine shock-moments. We've all seen too many (Asian) horror movies already in which white-faced spirits spontaneously appear & disappear again, and the mystery is always build up towards a point where the script can't possibly fulfill the audience's anticipations anymore. In \"Shutter\", you rather quickly figure out that Ben knows than he tells, so you can easily guess each and every plot twist far in advance. There are a very limited number of sets and exterior locations. Why didn't the film take advantage of the wondrous city of Tokyo, like for example \"Lost in Translation\" did? Rachael Taylor is certainly a promising actress with a lot of growing potential, so I hope she'll get offered a couple of better screenplays in the near future. Thus far, she only has horror rubbish like \"See No Evil\" and \"Man-Thing\" on her repertoire and those things won't get her noticed. Neither will \"Shutter\", for that matter.'\n",

Basically Benjamin 'Ben' Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and Jane (Rachael Taylor, a near spitting image of Nicole Kidman) are newlyweds, so are naturally taking as many photos as possible, whether meaningful of mundane. They move to Japan because of Ben's new and exciting job opportunity, a photo shoot in Tokyo, but on the way, driving on an icy road through a dark forest they seem to hit a girl and skid off road, but then they wake up, no body. Jane is sure of what happened, but she and Ben continue on to find their new perfect home, which they quickly, and the taking photos continues. Recently though when taking photos, Ben and Jane notice a strange white light is in most of them, and an expert tells them it is the sign of a spirit, i.e they have a ghost. With a series of nightmares, and worse strange events and attacks, the couple confirm that they are being haunted, and it appears to be that Japanese girl they hit with the car. But Ben reveals a very scary fact that he knew the girl, named Megumi (Megumi Okina), she used to be a stalker to him, she never left him alone, and they tried to frame her with some photos, but it turned into rape, and she committed suicide. In the end, Jane leaves him, and the saying \"she's with me all the time\" is very literal, she has been sitting invisible on Ben's shoulders since her death, explaining his weird neck thing, and in the end turning catatonic he is in a mental hospital.

Without watching Shutter you already know the format. Spirits that have pasty faces and fail to recognise the value of the slogan \"rest in peace. Shutter is also another \"ghost in the machine\" story, except this time the machine is a camera.The trouble is there is absolutely nothing scary about this movie . There is plenty of bangs and crashes and you are bombarded with noise but nothing at all visual that would remotely send a chill down the spine. There is one scene that i liked where the screen went black every few seconds as to imitate the flash of a camera but that is all i cant think of that i can say is good about this film.The acting is irrelevant because the film is so dull . Fans of The American Office and Heroes might recognise a couple of the cast.This is the first Asian remake i have seen that hails from from Thailand but it is still the same old dross that has been dished up over the last couple of years . Director Masayuki Ochiai has failed miserably to achieve anything worth while and it's a film that will fade from the memory very fast indeed.The PG-13 rating says it all, while opening the gates to bored teenagers it will turn hardcore horror aficionados in the other direction.I don't know about you but i want my Horror movies to be 18 rated and nothing less.3 out of 10'\n",

            "Review: 'This is a remake of a good Thai horror movie that was released back in 2004. I really enjoyed the original movie and I recommend it to everyone. Why did they need to do a remake of a movie that was released only 4 years ago? Did they think they can improve it in some way? Not only did they not improve it, they made it worse than the original in many ways. The brilliant music and sounds from the original are gone, the ghost is less scary, is shown more often, and it seems less menacing (at one step the ghost is even singing!), the acting is worse, and the characters are less believable than in the original.The producers introduced a few new elements hoping to make the movie more scary, but in fact they made it more disgusting (the flies for example). The original movie was full of clichés, but this one is even more so. The most brilliant part of the original movie was the ending. In the remake, they simply copied every scene from the last part of the movie, but with less talent and less impressive results.So, I return to my original question: why did they need to do a remake? What was the problem with the original movie released only 4 years before this one? The fact that the main actors were Asians and that they didn't speak English? Or more likely, the fact that Hollywood, which is apparently all out of ideas, couldn't let a good story fly by them without them making money out of it?'\n",

            "Review: 'There's a certain fashionable trait when it comes to J-Horror remakes. Bumps in the night, disturbing images and the most famous of all that same scary Japanese girl with the black hair covering her face. So it's no surprise that this latest revamp of the Korean chiller looks exactly the same ass all the ones that have been before. Only worse. Lacks the jump out of the seat horror of The Grudge, without the stunning atmosphere of the ring. No shutter takes its place in front of the Disaster of a film \"One Missed Call\" so bad you'd rather that very girl was haunting you simply to end the nightmare that is \"Shutter\" And yet with such a shimmering premise and an original that is remarkable at creating up scares it's a mystery why this did do too well. With One missed Call it was all out in the open. What with the Japanese original being far from brilliant. But here we have a brilliant premise, a decent cast and room for improvement. And yet it still managed to flop. Congratulation Hollywood you've done it again.For photographer Ben and his new wife Jane, his new assignment--a lucrative fashion shoot in Tokyo--was supposed to be a kind of working honeymoon. With this exotic professional opportunity and the limitless possibilities of a new marriage, Ben and Jane arrive in Japan.But as they make their way on a mountain road leading to Mt. Fuji, their new life together comes to, literally, a crashing halt. Their car smashes into a woman standing in the middle of the road, who has materialized out of nowhere. Upon regaining consciousness after the accident, Ben and Jane cannot find any trace of the girl Jane believes she hit with the car. Shaken by the accident and by the girl's disappearance, Ben and Jane arrive in Tokyo, where Ben begins his glamorous assignment. Having worked in Japan before and fluent in the language, Ben is comfortable there, and he eagerly reunites with old friends and colleagues.Jane, a newcomer to the city, feels very much like a stranger in a strange land as she makes tentative, unsettling forays through the city.

Jane's concerns escalate as she believes the blurs in Ben's photos are the dead girl from the road, who is now seeking vengeance for them leaving her to die.In all its merely an uninspired, freightless mess that nether inspires, incites of scares ultimately. Its half baked cliqued trash that deserves the be discarded as soon as possible.My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will enjoy this and on the list of bad J-Horror this ranks second last behind the dreadful One Missed Call. The movies never seemed to have one full complete plot that lasted from the start to the end. Everything happened so fast, and was insanely unrealistic. It wasn't entertaining, scary, or interesting. \"A classic dud.\"'\n",

But this ain't one of them. This movie was boring. I mistakingly bought it partly because the DVD commercial looked interesting and partly because I thought the average IMDb.com rating was 6.4/10, not 4.8/10 (as it stands today). Nowadays, I usually try to avoid movies with a rating less than 6/10 (in most cases).In any case, this movie was boring and not even remotely scary. There were a few interesting scenes, but most of them were near the end/climax of the movie. Even the dialogue/relationship between Jane and Ben were laughable, though I cannot remember how at the moment. I'm beginning to wonder if I am beginning to block this movie from my memory (but not enough for me to watch it a 2nd time).To help give you an idea of how bad this was, I liked White Noise and Boogeyman (2005) better than this flick.'\n",

And the similarity between both films does not stop right there. This is also a story where ghosts from the past comes back to life to scare and kill away a bunch of people, deaths that seems random and with no connection but there is one goal to be achieved by these ghosts. Instead of an cell-phone, the ghosts come out of photographs in bizarre moments; spirits ruining the photos taken by Joshua Jackson while enjoying honeymoon with his wife (Rachael Taylor), and also taking photos (that will be ruined too!) for his work making a great advertisement for a big company.Their problem started after accidentally run over a girl in the woods, and it looks like the girl's spirit is chasing them and killing some of their friends. The photographer's wife decides to investigate ghost appearances trying to understand what's behind all this, becoming an expert out of nowhere.\"Shutter\" has an style that is becoming a trend in horror films with a unfair fight between real world and imaginary world or people versus spirits, where one can attack and the other can only run and hide; Father Merrin and Van Helsing are not here to help them, and charismatic and intelligent guys like them does not exist in films like these and that is a shame. Worst than this: it's not a scary film and not even funny. It's just morose. But the plot twist at the ending, reminding of \"Ghost Story\" (1981) was amazing, lift up the movie a little bit, but not enough to make a good film. The main couple has a charm and a good presence but that's it, with the help of embarrassing special effects they'll be scared for life with a strange ghost behind their backs.

            "Review: 'Filmmakers have been shooting movies about ghosts as far back as 1898 when Gallic director Georges Méliès made \"The Cave of the Demons,\" or as the French called it \"La Caverne Maudite.\" Over a thousand movies since the Méliès cinematic short have been made about ghosts. Clearly, unlike some genres and characters, the ghost in a horror movie has proved to be a profitable if not always artistically successful staple of movie makers.The new Joshua Jackson & Rachael Taylor supernatural saga \"Shutter\" tries to imitate better Japanese horror thrillers like \"The Ring\" and \"The Grudge.\" This tepid remake of the similarly titled 2004 Thailand tale of terror about a ghost bent on revenge lacks spirit. Incidentally, the American-made \"Shutter\" qualifies as the second remake behind the 2007 nail-biter produced in India as \"Sivi.\" Unfortunately, Japanese director Masayuki Ochiaimaking his English language film debut--scares up no memorable thrills or chills. If you've ever seen one Japanese chiller about a cadaverous, raven-haired dead girl in a shabby white dress that materializes and vanishes without a trace, then you are miles ahead of both Ochiai and sophomore scenarist Luke Dawson. Despite its attractive cast, atmospheric Nipponese locales, and lenser Katsumi Yanagijima's superlative cinematography, \"Shutter\" qualifies as a hopelessly predictable and dreadfully dull frightmare. Creeping along at a minimal 86 minutes, this Twentieth Century Fox release provides nothing that you haven't recoiled at in previous PG-13 rated ghost stories. Blood and gore are held to an absolute minimum. Although it wasn't designed to discriminate against American tourists in all likelihood, \"Shutter\" appears to be anti-American to the core. If you come to Japan, bad things will happen to you, especially if you take advantage of native girls.Newlyweds Jane (Rachael Taylor of \"Transformers\") and Ben (Joshua Jackson of \"The Skulls\") travel to Tokyo where Ben has been hired by his old friend Bruno (David Denman of \"The Replacements\") to shoot high quality fashion photography. Actually, Ben has lived in Japan before and speaks with language fluently which puts his wife Jane somewhat at a disadvantage. Everything is love-dovey until Ben lets Jane do the driving late one night down a dark, freezing, snow-swept two-lane blacktop highway. The wraith of a young woman (Megumi Okina of the original movie The Grudge\") suddenly appears in Jane's headlights in the middle of nowhere, and our heroine slams into her. Reeling from the shock and the impact, Jane loses control of their automobile and crashes into tree. Afterward, our married couple inspects the asphalt but neither can find any traces of either blood or a body. Later, when the authorities arrive, they cannot find anything. They believe Jane struck an animal and the beast fled into the darkness to die. Nevertheless, Jane cannot shake the eerie feeling that she really did hit a woman.Not surprisingly, inexplicable things begin to occur to our twosome. Jane awakens from a nightmares about the accident, while Ben suffers from a pain in the neck. A doctor prescribes a pain-killer, but the medication has little effect. In an otherwise light-hearted scene, Ben programs his camera to snap pictures of Jane and him standing in front of Japan's breath-taking Mt. Fuji. When Jane and Ben look at the photos, they spot a smear of blinding white light on them. Of course, literal minded Ben contends that either he loaded the film improperly or the roll was defective when he bought it. Later, when Ben is shooting some expensive fashion stills, the same ghostly streaks mar his photos and he fears that he will lose his job because the budget cannot accommodate retakes. One of Ben's Japanese female assistants, Seiko (Maya Hazen), takes Jane to see her ex-boyfriend who runs a magazine devoted to 'spirit-photography' or pictures of ghosts. Interestingly, Ritsuo (James Kyson Lee), the editor of a magazine that publishes phony pictures of poltergeist phenomenon explains to Jane that the surest way to make certain that ghost streaks in a photo are genuine is to take pictures with a Polaroid camera. Since the picture is developed immediately, Ritsuo points out that the image couldn't have been tampered with by anybody. Jane takes his advice and sure enough she has a close encounter with this female ghost. Nothing that Jane can say, however, alters Ben's sense of disbelief.Things grow progressively worse as the evil she ghost attacks one of Ben's friends Adam (John Hensley of Fox TV's \"Nip/Tuck\") and he dies under mysterious circumstances. Eventually, after Jane decides that she does believe in the supernatural, she has to wonder why this Japanese girl is attacking the men that work in Ben's photography studio. By this time, you'll figure out for yourself the scandal that happened and everything boils down to an ordinary murder mystery so predictable that \"Shutter\" doesn't have a ghost of a chance of either surprising or shocking you with its revelation. What's really incredible about this botched effort is that Japanese director Masayuki Ochiai blew it as badly as he did. Ochiai made an impressive horror movie in 2004 called \"Infection\" that has been available for rental in the United States. Granted, \"Infection\" contains more blood and gore than \"Shutter,\" but \"Infection\" also generates a great deal of suspense and tension.Altogether, \"Shutter\" is a utter waste of time.'\n",

            "Review: 'As far as I'm concerned The Ring (remake--and the original really) is the scariest film I've ever seen. It just downright creeped me out and ever since then I've been all for the barrage of Japanese remakes that Hollywood has churned out even if some of them haven't been great. The Grudge was okay, most recently Jessica Alba's The Eye (see my reviews) and there have been not so great sequels and remakes as well from the Japanese or Asian films but I knew Shutter looked good and I'm so glad I checked it out because I think this is one of the top ones from the genre that they've done since the grudge. The entire film just has this eerie quality about it and even though it does have some cheap thrillers, scares, loud noises, it also really tries to get under your skin which I love about these types of films when you just get that eerie chill down your spine and Shutter does that. It deals with all the paranormal and eerie aspects of a haunting ghost story and even throws in a killer twist to boot although perhaps a little predictable I think you do see it coming but it doesn't make the film any less watchable. I happen to think Shutter is a downright brilliant horror thriller.I really like Joshua Jackson, and even during Dawson's Creek I thought he had potential and for the first time I think he really shows his adult acting chops in Shutter. He's a great lead in the film and you can almost let go his teenage persona from his younger years. I think this will really open up some doors for him because he's great at it. I would love to see him come back for a sequel if they ever did one. Beautiful Rachael Taylor is Jackson's newlywed wife Jane. She is probably even more the main character getting even more screen time which is nice because she is EASY and then some to look at. Despite her near picture perfect appearance she still has a very down to earth quality and you follow the mystery with her much the way you did with Naomi Watts in The Ring. She does a great job and her and Jackson are hot together and very believable. Together they make a terrific combo and add to the already great feel of the film. Megumi Okina plays the haunting gal from beyond the grave. She is appropriately eerie and adds even more human qualities to the seeming monster killer so that it feels even more real. David Denman, and John Hensley play small roles as Jackson's best friends and they both do a decent job in those roles although are kind of overshadowed by the stand out performances by Jackson and Taylor.Korean Director Masayuki Ochiai makes his American debut and he obviously has a clear grip on suspense and an intriguing story in any language. He does a really great job at the overall ambiance of the film and uses stereotypical but nonetheless terrifying settings like the abandoned buildings, and images in pictures and such. The film just will make you creep with the feeling that you're being watched through a camera nonetheless. Shutter lives up to it's name by really making the camera the focal point of this mystery and how to solve it. The story is really interesting and even though I had my suspicions of how the mystery would end it didn't make it any less enjoyable. I wouldn't say that Shutter is gory or really brutal although it does have it's moments but it really does go for the thrills and any great fan of this genre of film will LOVE Shutter. I think it's just awesome!! 9/10'\n",

I absolutely loved the original Thai horror film, SHUTTER, and I thought that this film might be interesting because of the new setting (Japan) and the presence of a Japanese director to give it some Asian sensibility. Sadly, while the film does have some flashes of inspiration here and there, these are few and far between and for the most part it ploughs the same old tired and familiar furrows.DAWSON'S CREEK actor Joshua Jackson takes over the leading role, a newlywed photographer on assignment in Japan who brings along his unfeasibly pretty wife too. Of course, there's hidden tragedy in his past, relayed to us via some plot contrivances and coincidences, involving his ex-girlfriend Megumi (played by Megumi Okina, who gives the only decent performance in the whole movie). Every major set-piece already happened in SHUTTER, especially the excellent twist ending from that film, so I found this movie bereft of surprise, originality and inspiration.It's well shot, but it feels hollow. Jackson plays a bland, self-loving character who frankly bored me, and his wife just seemed dim. The scares are signposted far in advance, and the old schtick involving spirit photography was frankly tiresome. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more had it been a truly original movie, but like most remakes this one just seems to have no point in existing.'\n",

Hollywood's obsessive love affair with making remakes of successful Asian horror films has given many chilling treats like 'The Ring' and 'The Grudge'. But nowadays, more and more disappointing and mediocre films are being made. Unfortunately 'Shutter' is one of the more disappointing ones I have seen. This film didn't scare me, didn't hold my interest for the most part, save the scenes after the false climax. Few days back I had defended 'One Missed Call' (actually that was more creepy than this), but now I will not take this film's side. Directed by Masayuki Ochai this is a remake of a Japanese and Thai film. Know how much parents think before showing their young ones a horror film? Don't think about it on this one, just let them watch it. They will have seen so many photos on T-shirts more scarier than the ghostly elements in this movie, even they will probably get bored. (I have even forgot that ghost girl's name!) Ben (Joshua Jackson) and Jane (Rachael Taylor) are newlyweds who excitedly head to Tokyo where Ben has a prestigious fashion photography assignment. However that excitement soon turns to dread as the couple is haunted by the ghost of a girl who appears in all of their photographs, and Jane had actually crashed her car into this spirit girl some time back. Jane is curious as to who the girl might be and her bizarre attachment to them, but Ben is more cynical at the beginning. Jane discovers some shattering truths that can change her life forever.This was coming on TV the other day and the opening sequence looked cool, so I watched it. It has some formulic horror genre elements: a Japanese ghost girl who is vengeful, black haired (and possibly anorexic!!), a subdued color setting and set design which imitates The Ring, a very happy couple. I was just waiting for the spirit to seek revenge and right all the wrongs inflicted upon her. Now that would be a good thing for me, if not for the laborious screenplay which doesn't take the plot forward and has no clever twists. Even little children won't be scared by this film, it was more like a drama to me. Performances are bland throughout, except for Jane, but she didn't have any other work other than clicking photographs. What other things did she do? Never explained, but Rachael did try her best and was pushing herself, I will give her credit for that. If the director had just focused on her rather than Joshua who still hasn't evolved from his Dawson Creek (I like that TV show by the way) level of acting, this would have been better. His friends are simply awful, they are caricatures and highly superficial. In terms of content, originality, characterization or emotional journey, this film didn't give me anything, at least it should have given me some chills. So, don't waste your time on 'Shutter', instead go and see 'The Ring' again.3/10'\n",

The thing that people need to realize is that when they are going to see a movie like this you know what you are going to get out of it. I hate it when people keep cutting down movies like this, such as One Missed Call and The Eye. In these kind of movies the ending is pretty predictable, its pretty much going to leave you hanging. Thats why I think people need to understand you can't hate a movie because of the ending. I thought that their was so much more to the story than just spirit photography. It explains why its happening to the people that are on their honey moon. It seems like in these kind of movies the story explains a lot more near the end. They kept doing many flash backs in this movie as well. That's when they were explaining the story a lot. This was actually pretty creepy, freightning, and scary all at the same time. It had a ton of sudden pop out right at your face scenes. Im sure that when you see this you will jump many times. I thought that it could have been a little bit better. I liked the idea of having it be two newly married couples that this spirit photography is happening to. I liked how the wife was fighting the ghosts the whole movie. The acting was surprisingly really good I thought. The wife in this played by Rachael Taylor did such a great job playing all the scared parts and emotional parts. Her husband played by Joshua Jackson did a great job as well. Some of the visuals were pretty sweet. They had a lot of nice camera shots of the whole city in Tokyo. After some of the people left the theater I heard them say I want my money back. This movie was trying to prove to you that making fun of people and treating them like crap at a younger age will come back to haunt you. Overall this was a decent movie with some good scares.

I kept waiting for the movie to get to the scary part, or at least the INTERESTING part. It never did.The ghost in this film is the least threatening movie ghost since Casper, I swear. Apparently she kills some people, but we're not ever shown what her involvement in the deaths is. She doesn't even look or act scary. She's just... there.This movie also falls into the same pitfall of confusing gross with scary that the One Missed Call remake did and gives us lots of bugs and other creepy-crawlies rendered in mediocre CGI.However, unlike One Missed Call, there isn't a single piece of genuinely chilling imagery here to save the film. We are shown a few things that are supposed to be creepy, but they're just gross or boring.And the story is completely uninteresting. There is no sense of foreboding because the story never hints that the ghost is going to do something violent or scary. Maybe this was intended to make it scarier when she did, but that doesn't matter because it isn't at all scary in the first place.I won't reveal the final twist, but be warned... it's only unpredictable because it's so freaking stupid and not scary that you can't believe they put it in the movie.Overall, I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen.'\n",

It is MUCH better in terms of plot, pace, suspense and horror. Instead of relying on the cheap, predictable *suspenseful music-BANG* Hollywood ploys very evident in this version, the original Thai version is very well built up, takes its time to set the mood and let the suspense and horror just seep in, and they also manage to throw in a bit of black humour as well (the public toilet visit late at night - classic). The background and development of characters in the original is MUCH better, and more plausible (with a more plausible explanation for why she turns up in photos - not this \"spirit photography\" crap), not to mention the acting is infinitely superior in the original.Hollywood fails once again. Skip this stupid knock-off and just go straight to the original.'\n",

Compelled by fashionably dressed model women, sometimes half naked, bright colors, spooky images and scenes that are only there to make you jump. Oh... and I forgot, no brains. They think you're all idiots so they give you this cliché garbage.Skinny attractive woman who couldn't act if it were cursed on her, walks around always looking fresh and dumb in designer clothes. This movie is about as intelligent as a log. Everything seems forced and none of it is original or done in a compelling way. I have to wonder if English was the native language of the director since most of the dialog is unacceptably terrible. Many times I cringed or laughed at things that I knew weren't meant to have that kind of reaction.Poorly paced, poorly written, poorly acted, the effects are okay. I haven't seen the original, but conceptually, this movie could have been great if it were done the right way. Unfortunately, it was not. F-'\n",

            "Review: 'Well, here's a unique film plot for you: A young American woman, recently married to a young photographer, moves to Tokyo with him for work, but he seems far more interested in both his career and a lady friend he hasn't seen in some time, whom the wife immediately and instinctively dislikes. Since he's neglecting her for his photography work, she wanders the streets of Tokyo doing touristy things. Yes, Shutter's opening reel is almost directly lifted from Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation.But we have to switch into crappy J-horror territory sometime, so it deigns to rip off its own genre instead, blatantly stealing from a myriad of recent, much better horror films, The Ring and Saw chief among them. In fact, there are scenes where I literally had to do slight double-takes, as lead actress Rachael Taylor clearly resembles Naomi Watts (she's ALSO an Aussie blonde), and in numerous scenes, her hair is done in such a way that it resembles exact shots from Verbinski's film, in addition to thieving the slow Psycho touch-based spinning-chair-reveal (the setting, situation, soundtrack and look are what makes it indistinguishable from its excellent source). As for Saw, you know that terrifying scene early on when the little bike-riding puppet shows up and keeps giggling while the main guy is having flashbulbs going and screaming, \"WHO'S IN THERE?!?\". Well, that scene is repeated nearly verbatim here, and amusingly, it doesn't even make sense, as he comes across his wife and it instantly switches gears (and in a second viewing of the scene, I realized they were trying to scare you by putting the ghost girl in different places, but they're laughably inept at even this, not leaving the exposures long enough to even get the effect of the scene).The original Shutter is a Thai film (you can tell by how long the crew's names are), and that far-less-reviled production is set in Bangkok, which would have, if nothing else, at least provided a new and unique locale for this type of film, but the producers of this American remake were stringent in their desire for it to be as formulaic as possible, so not only did they transfer the film to Tokyo, they decided against hiring the original director, choosing to go with a *JAPANESE* J-horror hack. The acting is about as unremarkable as possible, and I can literally remember two FACES in the entire film, much less character names much less actor names.The film is remarkably easy to watch, if only because so little happens that it made it seem like less time had passed. Its' main competition in 2008 are the three other neutered horror films, Prom Night, as well as fellow J-horror wheezers The Eye and One Missed Call. The Eye was surprisingly decent, blessed with both a unique conceit and a desire to actually develop its characters first. Prom Night provided empty pain from the opening frame, and One Missed Call, well...at least had that creepy ringtone. Shutter didn't even have that. It just made me want to watch The Ring.{Grade: 2/10 (D) / #53 (of 59) of 2008}'\n",

There they start noticing many weird signs after a tragic accident that they had. They discover also ghostly images in photographs they develop they have taken but also in their new photographs. They start searching and investigating about it and they want to solve this mystery behind these ghostly images.I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations about this movie thus, I wasn't disappointed by it. The direction of the movie which was made by Masayuki Ochiai was very poor and without any suspense except some jump scares which were very predictable. In addition to this, the plot of the movie was below average due to the fact that since the start of the movie we knew or it was very easy to understand what will happen next. About the interpretations, I don't have anyone to mention because every single actor who played in \"Shutter\" was below average as the plot was.

The story is pretty routine, the 'scares' are generally typical clichés, and the over all movie is underwhelming. It's basically another formula supernatural horror film that could really use a bigger dose of imagination.But despite all of its predictability, Shutter had a few good points that kept it from being a complete waste. Joshua Jackson did a decent performance and was the biggest highlight of the cast. There was a couple of effectively creepy scenes involving the evil dead girl menacing Jackson in his sleep.

There the young photographer Benjamin Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his recent wife Jane (Rachael Taylor) have a car crash on the road and hitting a rare girl who flees.

A series of terrible and mysterious deaths occur, as one friend commits suicide dropping himself from a high apartment while the creepy spirit possesses its victims.This frightening movie displays terror, shocks, hard-edged drama and creepy images. While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable Japanese adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Thailand. Nice and colorful cinematography filmed in Japan by the cameraman Katsumi . Suspenseful and mysterious musical score fitting perfectly to terror by Nathan Barr. The motion picture is professionally directed by Masayuki Ochiai in similar style to Hideo Nakata movies -The ring, Dark Water-. The director Masayuki(Infection, Dark tales, Hypnosis) is an expert on horror cinema and follows the wake of Japanese eerie phantoms of pale complexion and long hair as ¨The grudge¨ and several others.

PRESTO, a cheap horror movie ripoff!Here are a list of Parallels or Similarities between this movie and the Grudge and the Ring.Both - Person(s) who are dead, wanting revenge. Grudge - A man jumps off a balcony killing himself. Both - Hallucinations/Seeing Thingsie.Grudge - Ended with character in metal hospital, with the spirit nearby. (Grudge: Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, Shutter: Ben w/ Megumi on his shoulders.) Both - Female character investigates. Grudge - Occurs mainly in Japan Grudge - Person(s) that are dead, of Japanese origin. Ring - Bodies of the spirits found Ring - Occurrences don't stop after a \"proper funeral/burial\" had taken place as expectedAnyways, here's a quick rundown of the movie.Ben and Jane get married. Honeymoon cut short due to job opportunity in Tokyo, Japan. Both go there. While driving in a forested area, they run into a \"seemingly alive\" woman, literally. Car crashes, and both knocked unconscious. By the time they come to, the woman is missing, and they call the authorities but nothing turns up. From then on, all the photos Ben takes seem to have \"Spirits\" in them, which eventually mess up one of the photo shoots he was doing for his job. Also from that incident, they both start having hallucinations and rundowns with this \"spirit\". Eventually they both investigate together (after Jane herself has done by herself already) and find Megumi (the dead woman) dead in her house outside of Tokyo as a skeleton. Proper funeral occurs after a night where Ben and Jane both nearly die from her, and they expect everything to be fine; moving back to America. After that Jane discovers that her husband tortured Megumi in a way, and then Jane came to a conclusion that Megumi was trying to warn her about the kind of man he was, and leaves him. Ben then tries killing himself and ends up in a mental institution.If the story had a more original twist to it, it would have been a much better film. The suspense scenes were more comical then frightening (The spirit was randomly sitting down brushing her hair making a \"Grudge-ish\" sound, frightening Ben), and random women screaming didn't help the movie in any way.However, the acting in the movie was pretty good, so I can't fully hate the movie.Overall 3/10. I only suggest seeing it if you are trying desperately for a good laugh, or if you are completely bored into insanity.'\n",

While being predictable isn't necessarily a bad thing this movie already has strikes against it for being a remake of a Japanese movie that just doesn't translate well...like most Japanese horror movies.Don't get me wrong, I understand the plot and why the ghost is haunting him and all of that...it isn't complicated, it's just stupid. Ben's friends raping Megumi to get her out of his life is so far out there that the person who wrote it needs help from a competent therapist; or they should at least make an effort to study human behavior rather than cobble together a weak-ass plot out of a few poorly thought out ideas and then write in actions to justify the events of the film as an afterthought. None of the characters, besides Jane, behave in ways that make sense or in ways that a normal human would. I know, I know, this is supposed to be the result of a terribly tragic event that created psychic ripples or whatever but it's just not plausible. Sorry, I just need more than what this movie's story offered.The events in this movie could have been believable if the three characters who were involved in the abuse of the dead girl had at some point during the film been exposed, at least a little, as being somewhat sinister. I think the writer/director/whomever MIGHT have TRIED to convey this but unfortunately did so in such a poor manner that what the three of them did just didn't make sense; based on the characters and how they were presented and how they behaved throughout the film I just couldn't see them traumatizing that poor girl. The filmmakers should have attempted to show some private side of these three, shown that while they were adept at appearing normal they were in fact the real monsters, made even more monstrous by their ability to seem so normal.But no, instead we are presented with an implausible scenario perpetrated by people who, given examples of who they are as presented in the film, are acting so incongruous to their presented natures as to render suspension of disbelief nearly impossible. A good horror film should be immersive, persuasive even, and Shutter's lack of that, which is due to its disjointed story, is the final nail in the proverbial coffin.If, however, you have particularly low standards when it comes to entertainment and can be easily taken in by cheap camera tricks (that have been done before (and better)); if you can overlook bland, mediocre acting; if you don't mind \"scary\" content that is so cliqued that it's no longer even remotely disturbing...then you might like this movie.

The cast for the most part are okay in their roles but nothing memorable including Joshua Jackson, Rachel Taylor, and John Hesley in a brief extended appearance. This film was really lacking inventive scares, suspense, and a scary villain who seemed to be just a rip off all the other vengeful woman ghosts who can be found in many other horror movies out there. The eventual surprise dealing with one of the characters I sort of saw coming and the ending wasn't the greatest either but then again when do most horror films have a happy ending. There was a little suspense but no real scares fortunately they kept this movie to a trim 85 minutes but after watching it you still feel like that was a total waste of time. Overall Shutter has an interesting premise but little suspense, no real scares, originality (villain wise), and it doesn't offer anything new or exciting to the genre. Even the cast who put in an effort can't save Shutter from joining the long line of disappointing re-makes coming out these days. If they amped up the suspense, scares , and a more original villain the film Shutter would've been that bad but it ended up being a disappointment.'\n",

Shutter has a good premise, and when it was released in 2008, it was probably considered heavily scary. Now, it's more of a heart pounded than a \"I'm never gonna sleep for a while\". The premise was a really good one, it's intrigued me for a few years, and maybe I amped it up too much for myself. I was really disappointed when watching this.The acting is well done. The setting is good, and the scares are set up quite well.. This one is suspenseful, and it made me sit on the edge of my seat. But it just seemed too much. The glare in a photo and then suddenly a spirit appears in them. It took a little too long to build up, and by the time the real horror started, I wasn't fully immersed, so it really didn't go down too well for me. The ending was a real twist, and I was as shocked as Jane was on screen. It was a really good twist and I cringed away really badly and was nibbling on my lip as much as was possible.The ending of the movie as a whole, I found it way too cringey. A flapping door, a window reflection – it all just seemed a bit too cliché. The acting was done really well, as I said before. Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor did brilliant jobs at acting in this, but the star of the film was definitely Megumi Okina. She plays our spirit and I definitely want to see her in more things, and I will be watching through her filmography for sure. She did amazingly and she did really creep me out and gave me goosebumps. It was a good horror movie, it had some really good aspects, but at the end of it all, it ended up a total cringe fest, which really put me off the movie.'\n",

When they wake up, there is no sign of the girl in the road. It doesn't take long for Jane to think they are being haunted. Also, spirit flashes show up in the pictures Ben takes. What Jane doesn't know is that Ben knows more about the girl then he is letting on. Soon, Ben's 2 friends become victims, but why were they singled out. It's pretty easy to guess.This movie is written poorly. It's very predictable, using the usual scare tactics. The one cool thing was the film's explanation for the pain in Ben's neck.

I have seen some stinkers (i.e. I Know Who Killed Me, Balls of Fury, Good Luck Chuck), and this was up there on the list of the all-time worst movies. Allow me to list some of the worse points of the... a hem... \"film.\" 1. \"The Script.\" It was so boring. Half the audience was laughing at how stupid it was and the other half was asleep. The best part of the movie was the audience's reactions! 2. \"The Horror.\" Or lack thereof. An Asian girl wearing a hideous dress is not scary. Her just looking into the camera is not scary. A fly is not scary. The only thing scary was her dress.3. \"The Choices.\" I know this is a broad topic, so I'll go into detail. First of all, Josh Jackson is not the star. He plays second fiddle to some unknown Elisha Cuthbert look-alike. Come on, Dawson's Creek has to count for something! Secondly, The choice in setting was all wrong. It should have been set in the good Ole' U. S. of A.. Cut out all the \"Asian\" scenes... audiences are tired of remakes and any Asian components are both unnecessary and ruin the plot/dialog/script. I'm not saying there can't be Asian people... the assistant was fine... but it does not need to be \"Asianified\". Make it in America! Make it ACTUALLY Scary! 4. \"The Photos.\" We all went into this film wanting to see ghosts in pictures... admit it. I only wish I would have known before that I should have just internet searches \"Ghost Photos\". There were no \"real\" ghosts photos! I wanted to hear some scary stories about people who had their intestines turned inside out because there was an orb over their head in a photo from 1984!!! I think the film would have been a little better if it would have focused on the spirit photography instead of Joshua Jackson's character's personal demons. There are about 2 BA-Jillian movies out there where a character has personal demons. None of Spirit Photography, that I know of.So, now you see the reasons I have for you, loyal movie-goer, not to see this film. It will put you in a bad mood. Enough said!'\n",

The story is coherent, if a little clumsy. There's just enough momentum to keep your attention and the climax is sufficiently haunting.

The ghost is creepy – as are the various photographic links, the scares handled professionally by the makers, and the finale pays off with a startlingly chilling revelation that freaked me out; and I'm a middle aged man!It's far from perfect, the pace is a bit haphazard, logic goes out the window often, and cast performances are only adequate in the absence of \"A\" list stars to propel the story onwards. While it's tough to hang your hat on the two principal players since the emotional empathy hasn't been earned by them, courtesy of the writing.

The film feels like 2004's THE GRUDGE (Which was much better) but with cameras.

One of the best features is that there's just a literal ton of encounters with the ghost, and all of them are handled well enough to earn some great moments. From the first dark-room encounter where he finally becomes convinced of the presence of the ghost, the encounter with the ghost in the boardroom which is another stand-out due to the fantastic innovation of the Polaroid camera allowing for some suspense to be had with the waiting for the photo results to come about, and the interaction that happens once the revelation has occurred is really good, and the later attack alone in the apartment with only the flashing camera to provide any light in brief spurts, the sounds of what's going on making it so fun and creepy that works so well due to being quite long and intense, which makes it stand-out a little more than the quick-shot appearances throughout the beginning. Those quick-cut scenes are also are pretty good, with their being a fantastic collection of banging noises off in the distance, ailing cries throughout the house and different pop-ups everywhere, from a great appearance on a train that results in a fun freak-out to a really creepy scene with the ghost appearing in photos all across the apartment, these are all quite fun and really worthwhile. As well, there's an incredibly fun and enjoyable encounter late in the film through an attack at the house, which has a lot of good points about it, from the creepy ghost action to the great setting and what it signifies for what has happened so far, it's a great scene and really makes a great lasting impression. Even the early car accident here with the ghost appearing in the middle of the road and causing a severe accident comes across as really nice here, being a nice shock jump and done early in the film as well. The last plus is the conversation at the magazine, which is quite fun spilling the basis for the film's mystery and getting it all out in the open with the discussion of what's going on, it makes for some really good times and the photographs along the edges aren't that bad at all. These here all work to make this one quite enjoyable. There oddly wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this one. One of the biggest issues is a lame encounter in a friend's apartment late in the film being way too short for what it was intended to do. This here just doesn't really do much, and just really has a feel to it that makes it come off like so many other efforts in the genre. Of course, the camera angles used here are another factor, as they hide everything during the scene and really making it hard to figure out what's happening. Another small problem is the finale in America, which just feels tacked on and unnecessary as the story had ended nicely in Japan and really didn't have to come back to America for the final twist at all. The last flaw is that the revelation comes way too late to really mean what it could've, and since it's based on a mystery that just comes out of nowhere without really being developed well, making that twist highly unorthodox. Overall, though, this wasn't that bad at all.Rated PG-13: Violence, some Language and sounds of Rape.'\n",

The entire plot was so predictable and I literally sat there telling what would happen next without seeing it. It was not scary, the plot was terrible, and the ending was bad as well. The acting was decent, but in general the movie just wasn't good! I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all. I hate to be so pessimistic about the movie, but it really just was that bad! Take the $10 or so you would have spent on this movie and donate it to the American Cancer Society..the movie is just not worth it. EXTREMELY disappointed!'\n",

            "Review: '\"Shutter\" is a remake of a Thai horror film that concerns a couple who start seeing the ghostly image of a young woman. My friend told me that the American version was better than the original. After watching the movie, I have to disagree. As usual, it was dumb-down significantly compared to the Thai version. The story was rearranged, so it was more A-B-C. It's like they couldn't make it jump here or there because it was going to confuse the American audience or something. The friends were barely in the movie, and so you really didn't feel what idiots they really were. It wasn't as bad as other remakes, but it could have been better.'\n",

The only thing they can do now is get a better actor or more special effects. You don't go to a horror movie for a thought provoking story line, you go to get scared or grossed out, or to get REALLY close to your date. The movie accomplishes this, unless you are one of these people that walk through haunted houses and roll your eyes no matter what they throw at you. If you are then go get a job in Kosovo because that's about the only way you are going to get scared.I liked it and the ending was fitting. There's some good jumps and they manage to pull off ultra creepy without the jerky photography so commonly used in ghost stories now. One thing though: **spoiler**I also noticed a few comments as to why there was such a fuss about the pictures Jane finds in Ben's forgotten pictures. Ummm...lets see..he took pictures of the poor crazy girl while his two best friends raped her. There were more than 3 pictures. He didn't just mistreat her; he used her to make snuff pictures which is usually why you have vengeful female spirits. Again, cliché, but how many reasons are there to come back and terrify someone really?'\n",

I just feel so disappointed after watching this. I can think of a few scenes from the Thai version that stick in my mind, none in this and its nothing to do with the fact I've seen the Thai one first.

I'll give it to Shutter it was hunting not just from the perspective of the humans being haunted by the ghost but also the ghost who haunts because she has unfinished business. For that I give it an A, but the effectiveness of this hunting escapes me.

The theme of the movie becomes apparent towards the end and it does keep you guessing. Just when you think the movie is over...it isn't. For some that technique may be distracting but I actually feel it enhances a horror movie. The more the audience is fooled, the more potent the ending.Whether or not you believe in ghosts or ghost images, the theme of the movie is universal. We all pay the price for foolish acts whether or not we participate or just stand by and let it happen. The ending of the movie exemplifies this in a very creepy way.The fact that much of the movie takes place in Japan adds to the mood of the film. I have to admit that how Jane, wandering the streets of crowded Tokyo, manages to always find her way back to her apartment is a bit of a stretch. Anyone who has ever visited another city, especially one with a very different culture than our own, knows that you really don't want to go wandering the streets alone much less find your way around.If you're looking for a creepy movie, this might fit the bill. Don't expect Oscar-worthy acting, though. And don't expect scintillating conversation. The movie thrives on its creepy atmosphere, not dialogue.I have to say I did like the actress who plays the character of Jane. Of all the young faces on screen these days, she's pretty good. Something about her reminds me of Charlize Theron a few years back.'\n",

Both Jane & Ben search the area but find no-one, shortly after Ben who works as a photographer is given a job in Japan so both he & Jane pack up & move out there. After Ben's first photo shoot for an important client all the pictures come back with strange white, ghost like images on them which renders them useless. Ben thinks there's a technical problem with the equipment but Jane becomes convinced the pictures are spirit photo's, photograph's that capture the image of a ghost. Strange things begin to happen to Ben & Jane & soon they both believe they are being haunted by the girl that they ran over in New York but Jane decides to investigate & discovers a shocking truth about Ben & the girl who has been haunting them...Directed by Masayuki Ochiai this is an American remake of the Thai film Shutter (2004), while I have not seen the original Thai one it's probably a safe bet that it's better than this soft teen supernatural horror that is remarkable only for it's blandness. While I didn't think Shutter was the worst remake of a not as good as everyone makes out Asian horror I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone, having recorded it off cable telly & having watched it for free at least I didn't spend any money on it. The script is fairly routine, some young happy American couple move to Japan & are menaced by some ghostly girl with long black hair that covers her face, the looks & sounds are also very familiar. As usual it all ties into some shocking past event that the leads have to investigate & unravel, to be honest I didn't mind the ending that much & although it does come across as a little bit silly I did like the dark idea of some guy being left a hunchback vegetable confined to a hospital room for the rest of his life. The basic plot about spirit photo's doesn't go anywhere & in fact any serious exploration of the phenomena is abandoned after a couple of speeches by so called experts (wasn't it lucky that Jane showed those photo's to that Japanese girl whose boyfriend just happened to be the editor of a magazine about spirit photo's?) where Jane gets to look worried & then the concept is merely used to show what the ghost is up to. Also, why did Adam jump out of his apartment window & to his death? Was it guilt? He had never shown any guilt before. had he? Was he possessed? There's nothing else in the film to suggest possession so that's a little bit of a loose end for me. At just over 80 minutes at least it's short, it moves along at a reasonable pace with one or two decent enough moments but overall Shutter felt far too routine, bland & uninspired.Available in both PG & Unrated versions the Unrated cut doesn't feature any new violence or gore but instead some extra dialogue scenes that don't really add much (apart from a couple of minutes of running time). Like a lot of modern US horror Shutter was obviously intended for a teen audience & as such with it's PG rating feels very tame, there's no real gore or violence & only a couple of people die. Like the script the visual style of Shutter is also very bland & forgettable, there are lots of plain whites, greys & blacks which gives Shutter a very drab look.Filmed in Tokyo in Japan this did respectable business at the box-office taking over $25 million, the acting is alright & the cast is cute enough but again it's pretty bland.Shutter isn't the worst remake out there but at the same time isn't very good, I did like the concept behind the twist ending although the execution wasn't entirely successful. Watchable in a short none offensive sort of way but I doubt I will remember anything about it in a few days.'\n",

Her spirit keeps popping up in his photographs, and people close to the situation start dying in horrible ways. Later on, as things grow progressively worse, the wife discovers a terrible secret about the dead woman. This remake of an Asian vengeful spirit flick stars TV actor Joshua Jackson as the photographer and Rachel Taylor as his wife. The acting is barely passable, although there are a couple of decent \"jump\" moments. However, they are nothing you haven't seen before in movies like THE GRUDGE and THE RING. Speaking of other movies, the basic premise of this was lifted from an oldie but moldie with an all-star cast, GHOST STORY. Unless you're really bored, I'd pass on this one. Jackson is a very weak lead, Taylor is a generic wife, and nobody else in the cast caught my interest. They all just seem to be going through their paces.'\n",

While driving on a dark road at night, the couple runs over a mysterious woman who seems to appear out of nowhere and can't be found after the accident. Over the next few days, Jane goes sightseeing while Ben works, only to see strange apparitions that also appear on the photos she takes. After Ben's photos show the same ghostly forms, he confesses that he knows something about the woman they ran over, but it may be too late to stop her trail of terror.I was surprised. I really was. Well, the idea of me liking this movie isn't a bit improbable, because I always seem to never loathe the new surge of Asian horror remakes that have been coming out the last few years. In fact, I seem to be enjoying most of them, but I was still surprised. Throughout the film, I found myself entertained and intrigued. Scared? When are they ever? Nevertheless, the film was entertaining. Do I keep my standards low? You can answer that yourself.I have never seen the original film (whoever does?), but I found the premise very interesting. I was hooked and never found a boring moment in the film...ever. Now that says a lot. Maybe the idea of spirits trying to contact humans from photographs is interesting. It sounds plausible too. It's not as if a tape is going to kill you in seven days, right? Just look at the infamous photo of Abraham Lincoln standing behind his wife after he died.The scares are kept at a minimum here, which is no surprise. After all, it's PG-13, geared towards a certain young demographic. However, there are still some moments of suspense and scenes I found disturbing, probably due to the extra five minutes in the unrated version I've seen. Also, the movie doesn't try to scare the audience with pop out moments. Doesn't that just annoy you? Thankfully, there aren't any here, or at least any major ones that I can remember. There is one fantastic scene that is pretty memorable and can get underneath one's skin. I'll not spoil it but I'll just say it involves a camera (duh). The scene is really well done which then leads me to the technical aspects of the film.I've got to say, I was impressed by the overall look of the film, most of it shot in Japan. I found the scenery just beautiful and gorgeous. The cinematography was great along with an actual score that I found stunning. I also liked the fact that there were little uses of CGI and big set pieces. The movie feels contained in its own world and it doesn't depend on CGI to make audiences feel uncomfortable. What made this movie not linger in the \"bad area\" were the leads. Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor were both great in the film. I really liked them.In the end, the movie also managed to trick me in one or two plot twists I didn't predict. Sure, the scares are mostly nonexistent, save two or three scenes, but what can I say? I found myself thoroughly entertained and intrigued from beginning to end. The leads were also pretty good. Overall, if you usually enjoy these PG-13 Asian horror remakes, movies like THE RING and THE GRUDGE, there's no doubt that you'll enjoy this too. For others, if you loathe these remakes, well, you know what to do.'\n",

But the way the film is presented makes you yawn sporadically a couple of times, or maybe it was just my short 6 hour night nap. None of the deaths are meticulous enough to demand positive reviews, except the climax with Joshua Jackson, in which he doesn't die but becomes deranged.

            "Review: 'Remaking Japanese horror movies seems to be the latest film-making trend these days and \"Shutter\" is no exception to the rule. The Japanese are a highly superstitious people concerning the paranormal and their fascination and/or reverence for it clearly comes across in their films. To that degree, they are the leaders in the horror film genre and always manage to be more creepy and hair-raising than their American counterparts. Filmmakers here in the States must've figured that out long ago and are seeking to profit from it. It's a shame really, but then again, isn't imitation the sincerest form of flattery? It must be, since so many of these Japanese filmmakers are sanctioning these remakes.Take for example the one that started it all: \"The Ring\", a horror film originally entitled \"Ringu\" by Hideo Nakata made in 1998. Gore Verbinski remade it in 2002 and when comparing the two films, several shots were arranged in the very same manner and the art direction is curiously similar. In the five years since then, \"The Grudge\", \"The Eye\", \"Dark Water\", \"Pulse\" and \"One Missed Call\" have all made appearances, their Americanized stories culled from their Japanese counterparts. At first wildly popular, the Eastern horror juggernaut must be slowing down because \"Shutter\" made a modest $10.4 million it's opening weekend and a domestic gross of less than $26 million compared to the staggering box office of \"The Ring\" (domestic gross was $128.5 million).\"Shutter\" begins with just-married couple Ben (Jackson) and Jane (Taylor) as they embark on their lives together into bustling Tokyo. Ben's occupation as a fashion photographer moves them there (much the same as Charlotte's husband in \"Lost In Translation\") and while the couple are cutesy and affectionate, it ain't all sweetness and light - somebody's got a dark past and it's about to get unearthed in the creepiest manner possible.Ben and Jane's married life gets off to a rocky start. As they are making their way on a dark wintry road on the outskirts of the city, an unidentified woman steps suddenly from the shadows in front of their vehicle and Jane slams on the brakes, fishtailing off the road and slamming head-on into a tree. When both of them come to after passing out, there is no trace of the woman despite a police search and inquiries to local hospitals. As they try to forget about what happened, images of the woman both in Jane's dreams and in her waking hours make it impossible, as do all sorts of photographs they have developed after the crash. Every picture Jane or Ben takes contains paranormal imagery and convinced it is the girl that she saw in the road that night, they go to an expert in spirit photography to help analyze their photographs. When given an unsatisfactory answer, Jane does some of her own sleuthing and armed with a Polaroid camera, she snapshots her way into a startling discovery with the guidance of the agitated specter.Jane links the spirit, Megumi Tanaka (Okina), with her husband and he admits to a long-ago relationship with Megumi that went horribly awry. It isn't long after his confession that Megumi begins to haunt those she knew in life and people start to have strange \"accidents\" resulting in their deaths. We think Megumi is simply a predator bent on destroying people who have wronged her but a character's words always come back to \"haunt\" us throughout the film: Why go to all that effort unless you have something to say? \"Shutter\" may be predictable for that very reason (as many will speculate) but it's a cut-and-dry 90 minutes so you don't get strung along for too long with this been-done formula. It's twist ending is hardly a twist, seeing as how so many filmmakers go for that anymore but it's entertaining enough for a Saturday night rental with the lights out and a tub of popcorn in your lap.The \"Shutter  Unrated\" DVD has an array of featurettes along with commentary and an alternate ending that's not really worth it (there was only a minor change  the ending remained largely the same).Bottom line: \"Shutter\" doesn't really live up to its predecessors (namely \"The Ring\"  that's still my top choice for Japanese remakes) but if the story interests you and you enjoy a good paranormal yarn, it's a potentially satisfactory choice.'\n",

            "Review: 'There are a section of people that will more than likely put this American remake of the original Thai movie down purely BECAUSE it's an American remake, which is ridiculous in all honesty. There are plenty of remakes of Asian horror that have still been as enjoyable as the originals and it's actually quite sad people will not like the remake purely because it's an American version. If you go into this version with an open mind, even after seeing the original, then you should still quite enjoy it.This one sticks pretty close to the original in storyline as well, which is a good thing because with it being a remake you sometimes kind of expect them to change things around, and end up ruining it but they don't. The ironic thing is with that though, is if you've seen the original then you know what to expect at the end so it kind of takes that surprise element away slightly.Anyway, this one felt like it was a bit slower for the first half of the movie that what the original did, but thankfully it picks up enough within the last 30 minutes or so to make up for that. The story unravels nicely enough as it goes along, keeping your interest peaked to keep you watching until the very end with a decent amount of tension & suspense, which again gets better as the film goes on. There are also some nice creepy moments here and there and while none of them will seriously freak you out, they do enough just to make you feel that wee bit uncomfortable.The cast are OK and they do a decent enough job, but there's just something about Joshua Jackson that is out of place with his role of Ben. It's not that he does a bad job with the part, but I do feel that someone else might have done a better job. Then again it could have been worse...they could have got the emotionless Mark Wahlberg in instead.Overall, while this won't go down as being one of the best horrors of all time, it's still a very decent movie. Ignore any of the hate you read about it and judge for yourself.'\n",

Otherwise, there was nothing horrible about this film, but there was nothing memorable about it either. Perhaps if it was more atmospheric, it would have kept us more intrigued. Another way to deal with this is to connect the crowed Asian city with loneliness, but the film makers didn't seem to understand one of the basics of film making, which is to use visuals to reflect internal, psychological states. However, the biggest problem I had with this film was that it was difficult to feel much towards the main two characters.Now there is a good reason for this, and I won't spoil things for those who haven't seen the film, but I'll just say there was probably a better way to handle the situation Now on to the spoiler, so stop here if you don't want to know something that happens towards the end. Obviously, there is no way a young woman would have been deteriorating there for months, and it's not consistent with the story anyway. The film seemed too long, and the major development at the end, what the wife discovered about her husband, and what happened to him, should have been enough.One thing that could have been emphasized is that the woman/ghost was part of the problem - she wasn't totally right or horribly wronged, as if she had been murdered. In any case, something was necessary to \"spice\" this thing up, but instead it's almost seems like a ghost story \"by committee.\"'\n",

            "Review: 'If the words \"PG-13 Asian horror remake\" didn't make you want to avoid \"Shutter\", maybe these wise words will. IT SUCKS.\"Shutter\" is the third PG-13 Asian horror remake of the year, following \"One Missed Call\" and \"The Eye\". \"The Eye\" was surprisingly alright, I give that an average 6 out of 10. \"One Missed Call\" was absolutely horrid, but it was extremely funny, even though it wasn't trying to be. \"Shutter\" may be a step up from \"One Missed Call\", but not by much.So, instead of a killer in your TV, or a killer in your cell phone, or a killer in your video game, in this movie, we have a killer ghost that you can only see by taking a photograph of it. The movie follows two newlyweds off to Japan so the guy, Ben, can have a photographing career there. On the way to Japan, they hit a woman in the road! OH MY GOD! Of course, there's no evidence there was a woman there, so they go on their merry little way, even if the girl, Jane, is a bit weary.Soon, you guessed it, strange occurrences start to happen. Was it the woman who they hit? Has she come back as a ghost? Or will there be a dumb twist (or multiple dumb twists) that will change everything? I guess you're just gonna have to watch the movie to find out, because I'm not giving any spoilers. But, if you really want to know what happens, just find out on the internet and save yourself an hour and a half of your life.The characters are about as developed as you'd expect from one of these stupid PG-13 horror flicks made for hordes of teenagers that don't know that they're gonna suck. So, that basically means you don't know anything about the characters. The twists are poorly done, they don't really even change anything, and they just seem thrown in to waste time. The dialogue sucks. The plot sucks. The kills aren't original, and since it's PG-13, it's about as gory as your average romantic comedy. There's nothing to recommend about this film. It's not even laughable, as \"One Missed Call\" was, it's just boring, stupid, predictable and a waste of your time.Plus the fact that the ghost is not menacing or scary in any way. She's not freaky looking like \"The Ring\" girl. She's just a normal looking Asian girl. Ooh. Freaky.Speaking of freaky, there's nothing remotely scary about this movie. \"Shutter\" aims low, with no real attempts at suspense, just stupid jump scare, after stupid jump scare, after stupid jump scare. It's like they weren't even trying. It's just the 'ol \"girl looks scared, then the guy puts his arm around her, and she freaks out\" trick OVER and OVER and OVER, until you're so sick of it, you just want the stupid movie to be over. There's not even stupid freaky-looking mothers and babies like there are in \"One Missed Call\".I got the Unrated DVD from Netflix, because I wasn't gonna pay to see this crap in theaters, but I have no freakin' clue how it's \"unrated\". I didn't see the PG-13 version, but I can't imagine it's that different. There's no gore, there's no nudity, there's nothing that could possibly make it even rated R. But, then again, it's probably just the same version put into theaters, with an \"UNRATED\" sticker put on the cover to increase sales.I have yet to see the original \"Shutter\". It's apparently supposed to be pretty good, and maybe I'll watch it, but if it's as bad as this one, I'm staying as far away from it as I can. I'll give \"Shutter\" a 3 out of 10, because it made me laugh from time to time. (Like when a character starts electrocuting himself, and when a guy gets his eye snatched right out of him)Oh, by the way, it's sad that the guy who plays Roy in \"The Office\", and John Hensley from \"Teeth\" agreed to be in this mess, because they actually have talent.

This was put together by very immature writers who include the typical sex scene, cheesy dialogue and God awful ambient music.

            "Review: 'Shutter seemed like a promising horror flick. I saw The Grudge (American) when it came out and thought it had something to offer my kind of crowd, the college moviegoer. I was expecting for this film to have the same effect. Unfortunately, I think that the best thing about this movie was the trailer, and after finding out that this was a remake, I have to ask why was this movie even made? Was it only made because we can't read (subtitles) and watch at the same time? Without seeing the original, I can only guess that it is better. The Shutter remake had all the potential to be a great scary movie. It had the creepy music, lighting, and ghosts. It also had a very interesting theme of incorporating a vengeful spirit into photographs that definitely worked better than the whole \"noise\" concept of the movie White Noise. (Shutter remake is definitely better than White Noise.) However, the concept was not original to this film, and therefore, they really didn't need to remake a movie so soon after the original (if at all). The effects in this movie were probably a little bit more enhanced, but it's nothing I haven't seen before. They definitely weren't on the level of The Grudge (maybe budget constraints?)I don't think the actors and actresses stood out at all in this movie. You'll think Rachel Taylor is beautiful and Joshua Jackson plays his part well, but they're just blah. Their chemistry is blah. Their performances are blah. You could replace them with another actor and actress, and it wouldn't make a difference. I just felt like they could have done a lot more. It didn't scare me nearly as much as I would have liked it too. It was enjoyable to a point, but my friend and I both had to ask, was that it? I thought the ending was a bit contrived, maybe because I already gathered everything I needed to know from the trailer so the \"twist\" was just as predictable as everything else. They needed to do a lot more with Joshua Jackson's character in my opinion to put this movie over the edge, and they failed to do that. So basically, this film will scare the younger crowd. In fact I think that's why it's PG-13 rated to get kids in the theater and make a buck. It's not going to do anything for anyone who is wanting something more than The Grudge. It'll creep you out a little but its style and concept is predictable and nothing new.Overall, 6/10 for me for its average horror movie appeal.'\n",

While driving on a deserted road, she runs into a woman. Both Ben and Jane pass out in the crash. Upon waking, nobody could find the woman. However they start to be haunted by her.

With photography going digital, this one is on the verge of being obsolete. It's a rather bland horror and not a scary one. There is no new visual ideas in this.

Initially, I wasn't actually going to sit down and watch this movie from director Masayuki Ochiai, given the fact that it was an American cash-in on the 2004 Thai horror movie also titled \"Shutter\" from directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom. But I opted to give the American remake the benefit of the doubt and watch it.And the movie was exactly as you would assume it to be; an unnecessary Americanized remake of an Asian horror classic. Yeah, it is amazing that American cinema needs to encroach on the Asian successful horror movies and make watered down, flavorless and pointless American remakes of them; it happened with \"The Grudge\", it happened with \"The Ring\", and so forth. And yeah, \"Shutter\" is just another one to that list.I wasn't even familiar with the cast ensemble that they managed to get together for this Americanized remake. The acting performances in the movie were fair enough, I will say that much.Visually then \"Shutter\" is okay, and that does count for something.If you found this 2008 Americanized remake entertaining and good, then you most definitely owe it to yourself to watch the original 2004 Thai movie, because it is a way more entertaining and in-your-face kind of horror movie, and a way more effective scary movie as well. There simply is no denying it; you don't import something that works in Asia and is a success there and try to dress it up to look American.My rating of \"Shutter\" lands on a bland four out of ten stars. This is essentially a very unnecessary Americanized remake.'\n",

They have an accident and run over a girl, but they can't find a body when they regain consciousness. Then after that they start seeing her ghostly image in the photos that they take.For a psychological horror it wasn't scary. There were a few jump scares that were average. They made my girlfriend jump, but I unfortunately saw them coming a mile off. It is just a shame that this was not scary. But then I have never been scared by a horror. I wish I was... I think I would enjoy them more if I felt the fear. Instead I just find them entertaining.The film stars Joshua Jackson, Rachael Taylor & Megumi Okina. The acting was alright... I liked the Megumi. She was spooky and intense.The effects were good... when she got run over it was gruesome and really well done. Also, there were some scenes later in the film where she starts haunting them where it was so well put together it didn't look too fake. I liked it.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It was good, but a little predictable.

Others seem to fall apart, like \"Ghost Story\".This ghost story isn't so hot. It begins with an apparent accident and it's revealed that the victim, a young girl, is haunting the couple in the lethal car. But, actually, that's not the reason at all. The REAL reason the young lady is haunting the couple is that the husband had an affair with her, blew her off, and now she's getting revenge.These spirits or ghosts or whatever they are seem to be all around us because they show up in some photographs as white blurs. Sometimes their ectoplasm is realized and they stick their tongues down your throat so you drown in your own blood. Sometimes, in the ectoplasmic present, they just sit around in the distance and sulk.The acting here is okay, no more than that. And the direction includes a lot of cheap shots. The women in the piece, Rachel Taylor, an uber-Aryan, pauses trembling before a door. Her hand reaches towards the doorknob. And with a loud BANG on the sound track, the door is jarred open and an ordinary chatting couple pass through from the opposite side. No opportunity for a cheap thrill is passed by. There is the rotten skeletal corpse from \"Psycho,\" the spoiled photographs from \"The Omen,\" and multiple surprises accompanied by stings on the sound track.The photography of Tokyo is magnificent, though, crisp, with colors drawn from the cool end of the spectrum, so that when a scarlet kimono shows up, it's a bigger shock than the hand reaching in from off screen and touching somebody's shoulder.Nice location shooting, yes, and Tokyo is so CLEAN for a monster city. Yet there's nothing much new here, so move along.'\n",

If you go into the movie cold, without knowing about the Thai film, it is a tense, creepy thriller that is not quite \"horrible\" enough to be a horror film. The characters are fairly typical of Americans in remakes of Japanese/Asian films: attractive, if somewhat generic, and uneven in their abilities in their new country. The film would lose a few steps if she spoke Japanese as well as he did. Because she does not, she relies on her husband, an unreliable narrator at best, and the viewer can empathize with her unease at the knowledge she is not aware of everything that is going on.One thing that makes this film enjoyable is that the viewer can see the relationship eroding over time. Originally, the couple was very much in love. However, as the spirit makes herself known and the killings begin, the viewer can see the tension--and the doubt--spread between husband and wife. The ending demonstrates quite clearly how the intention to deceive can destroy everything and gives a unique interpretation of a depressed person carrying weight on his or her shoulders.I enjoy this film well enough to look for it as part of my annual October viewing, as a prelude to Halloween. It's definitely not for Asian film aficionados, but is enjoyable enough as an American film to watch on a windy, rainy October night, when the spirits are on the move.'\n",

The wife swears she saw a victim they hit that was dead in the road...but the husband and ambulatory staff never see the girl. As they recover and return home they feel haunted by the events.

The horror elements rely on strobe lights, random girls walking across the screen or popping up around characters. The storyline is limited and the live story was a bit annoying. Most of the film is predictable and the only redeeming element was the use of flies and flies under the skin.Overall, this is a below average addition to the horror genre that's not really worth your time.

For instance, I used to have a very big problem with watching foreign films, simply wasn't able to connect with a film in a language I couldn't understand. However, luckily the Horror genre really cured me of that, and today Japanese Ghost stories are one of my favorite sub-genres.Shutter is the only Hollywood remake of a Japanese Horror film that I've seen after already seeing the original (haven't seen A Tale of Two Sister before The Uninvited, or the original Ring and Grudge before the remakes). It takes a lot out of the experience of watching such a film, as it's very loyal to the original, so anyone who's seen the original will not be surprised by the turn of events and twists...The real compliments I have for this film are for the excellent story and surprising twists that really caught me off guard, and should therefore go to the original version. This remake is, however, very well done.All I can say is that this film is recommended for all you Ghost stories fans who enjoy Hollywood more than Japanese cinema, or for you truly devout Horror freaks who'd like to compare this to the original.

The storyline and imagery in this version are so reminiscent of other films in the genre that I kept feeling, as I was watching it, that I had seen this exact same movie before (and, no, I haven't seen the original). The derivative nature of the film hampers our enjoyment of even the few moderately suspenseful scenes director Masayuki Ochiai has been able to wring out of this shopworn material.

With the police at the scene finding no body, after Ben & Jane's car smashed into a nearby tree, it becomes apparent to Ben at least that his wife, from the all night driving, was just hallucinating when she thought that she struck the young woman. It wasn't until a number of photo's that Ben took of Jane and himself with Mount Fuji as a backdrop that it became evident that the woman wasn't a figment of Jane's imagination at all! she was real! Real enough to somehow be able to get herself into the pictures and make her imprint on them!Later when Ben does his photo shoot for Japan's top fashion magazine the photos come out blurred with this white eerie ghostly streak running through them. Jane knowing that there's something very strange about Ben's ruined photo's notices on one of them that the streak points to the TGK building in downtown Tokyo where Ben, before he met her, used to work! Going inside the building to take Polaroids Jane notices a photo hanging on the wall in one of the offices that has a group photo with the mysterious woman in it! The woman, Megumi Tanaka, turns out to be a former employee of the TGK building and the person, who's name is printed on the back of it, who took the photo is non-other then her husband Ben Shaw!***SPOILER ALERT*** I takes a while for the film \"Shutter\" to get to the point of its story with Ben, who acted as if he was totally unaware of Megumi existence, knowing a lot more then he lead on to. Ben having had a affair with Megumi, before he met his future wife Jane, and then breaking it off drove the sensitive young woman to to suffer a serious mental breakdown. Trying to get Megumi, who was constantly stalking him, off his back Ben tried to blackmail her by getting his two American friends in Tokyo Bruno & Adam, David Denman & John Hensley, to get Megumi stoned, on wine mixed with sleeping pills, and have them photographed, by Ben, having sex with her. As it later turned out this attempt at blackmailing Megumi would soon lead to both murder and suicide to everyone involved with the exception of Ben Shaw. Megmi had something very special in store for Ben which in his case death would have been a much welcome relief!Nowhere as good as the Japanese version the film \"Shutter\" is still worth watching not only because its gorgeous photography of the Japanese countryside and the city of Tokyo but it's unexpected and out of left field surprise ending. It's then when Jane finally finds out what Ben has been hiding from her, in regards to Megumi, and checks out on him before the \"shutter\", a wall photo of herself, clicks open and shuts down on her!'\n",

            "Review: 'Shutter is a rather different remake than the usual Japanese to American horror, it has a pace which is just cracking, it's speeds along very fast but smoothly, one thing I dislike is when a film takes too long to get going and it lags but this movie doesn't waste any time in telling the story. American remakes of Asian film can either be really good or really bad, this is a good one, in lots of ways, the first being the excellent central performance by Rachael Taylor, Australia's newest up and comer. This film was made a few years and it was before I knew anything about Rachael Taylor but recently I have seen her in quite a bit of stuff and I have to say she has a great screen presence, she is wonderful in Shutter and pretty much everything else she's in.Josh Jackson is pretty standard as the boyfriend with a bit of a secret, I mean his role could have been played by anyone but yeah he's also pretty good. The story is a cool one which made me google spirit photography afterwards, when horror film come out they have to have something different about them, not enough of them do and they suffer because of it. The story unfolds in a mish mash of photos and horror images and the twists that come out towards the end are ones I didn't see coming.All in all I just found this movie to be far superior to so many others, it just has something the others don't, I can't put my finger on it but it just does. Horror fans should enjoy this a lot and I would recommend it to people who like something a bit different, yes it's pretty tame and could be a lot scarier but it doesn't out stay it's welcome at all. Check it out people, and discover the great actress Miss Taylor.'\n",

This offering is as average as it's 2004 predecessor, screenplay writer Luke Dawson injects the Americanisms and little else. There are good solid performances by Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor, with the template already set director Ochiai does a more than satisfactory job. He also makes the wise choice of using Japanese locations than sets, which are striking at times.Regrettably, everything is forgettable and it not the films fault. It's the fact that if you've seen any recent Asian remakes The Grudge for example; you know ten minutes in what the twist is going to be. There are some creepy moments and it's better than most of the remake batch including films such as the teen orientated One Missed Call (2008)and Pulse (2006).Shutter is competently spooky,with some nice effects and to its credit a lot better than the endless supply of teen horrors that are doing the rounds.'\n",

However, I saw it with no preconceived notions, and I left the theatre with a smile on my face. So while it may not be the best movie out there, it most certainly is not the worst.Sometimes, the movie does feel a little cliché, and the acting can feel just the same--sadly, the main protagonist of the movie is guilty of this crime. On the other hand, there were no flaws glaring enough to make me walk out of the theatre, so I can deal with small things like this.The movie only made me jump once or twice, and only then because my friend was making me really nervous. Don't worry, though, I got her back by jumping when nothing was happening, causing her to scream. The few \"horrors\" in this movie are mainly shockingly disgusting visuals and a few \"boo!\" moments, but other than that, don't expect to have nightmares.I kind of feel like this movie was a bit misrepresented. It wasn't really a horror movie--it kind of left me in a thoughtful mood. If you go into the movie with an open mind, I'm certain you won't be disappointed. The ending was certainly nothing like I expected--again, the movie was not the best, but you could do a lot worse.'\n",

She is never convincing and the way she leaves her husband before he finds out the truth about him and Megumi, would never happen in real life.Also considering what he did to Megumi it seems strange he kept not only the camera she gave him, but also the memory-card with the photos that could send him to jail.

            "Review: 'Let me say first that I have not seen the original, but this has definitely pushed me to do so. Why? Because, while it is not an entirely original concept, it is one that has a very strong possibility to create some real scares. I've experienced spirit photography and worked in the field for a while, so the story is an interesting one to me.But, why did this fail? It has an actor that I've enjoyed since my youth (Josh Jackson since the 'Mighty Duck' series), an interesting story (spirit photography), a beautiful backdrop (Tokyo), and looked pretty good for its meager $8 million budget.The simple answer to its failure is this: It completely ruined every single thrill and scare it was trying to give. For instance, when Ben (Jackson) was in the studio in the dark, this could have been a terribly frightening scene. . . but it just wasn't. I'm not entirely sure WHY it didn't give a single good scare in this scene, but it just didn't.Another mark of failure was the overall pacing. It would shift from long periods of no/subtle ghost activity and then hit a patch where every single scene would have some type of \"big\" ghost scene (the most obvious instance of this is after they go to Megumi's place and return home). It made for an overall boring film with a few chunks that overdid it with the attempts at scares (almost all of which failed).From a technical point of view, the direction wasn't too shabby and managed to make a very good-looking film. The script needed some work, as I said, with the pacing. It did work fairly work with some of the character building, but I would have liked to see a bit more of the downward spiral of the two main characters. They seemed a bit too. . . well kempt for having been tortured by a ghost for weeks/months. Also, the acting was very stale and stiff for the most part, with most of the actors just moving through without passion.Overall, it was watchable. . . but, truly nothing special. There's nothing very new here and I can imagine many losing interest halfway through. However, the twist is interesting enough to warrant sticking with it, even if it's not all that surprising.Final Verdict: 5/10.-AP3-'\n",

            "Review: 'To say that the Hollywood J-horror has outstayed its welcome since first arriving many years back with The Ring would be an understatement; nowadays it's not uncommon to see three, four, maybe even five releases in the one year, all of which being more or less unidentifiable from each other. The one difference that most do have however lies in their basic premise, or concept, or gimmick. Shutter's gimmick lies in the paranormal field of spirit photography; ghosts or spirits that communicate their overwhelming emotions and unfinished business through the medium of photography. As a concept, it flat out beats the vast majority of the others that have graced the big screen so far this year, but lumbered with the same run of the mill techniques to convey its concept, the movie as a whole feels tired and lazy. The performances aren't half bad, and there are moments when Shutter does get a little intriguing but unfortunately much of this is usually followed closely by arrays of problems. Fans of the genre should probably give it a look but then again, anyone who has seen more than a few of such films really won't be surprised by how things unravel here.For this spooky adventure we follow photographer Benjamin Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and newlywed wife Jane Shaw (Rachael Taylor) as they travel to Japan for business on account of Ben's new job. Japan being the misty, forest-filled country that it is however, soon has tourists Ben and Jane lost in the middle of nowhere and lo-and-behold, they run over a weird looking Japanese girl in some eerie dress from the twenties. Following this, it appears that Jane and Ben can't escape the image of the girl whether it's through their own eyes or the lens of a camera. Herein lays Shutter's biggest interest which purely lies in the concept of a spirit contacting people through photographs; sure it's undoubtedly ridiculous, but as a cinematic premise, it's not bad and lends well to creating atmosphere and tension. As is mostly always the case with films of the genre however, the writing is far overdone here, and soon the idea turns into an over-analysed gimmick that the writers and their characters try far too hard to explain. Director Masayuki Ochiai does well to try and cover up much of this detective-mystery tangent in order to conceal, and in turn develop some tension, yet the scripts insistence on giving reasoning too often overwhelms its insistence on telling an interesting, scary story.Main characters Ben and Jane are your typical horror movie newlyweds; both are madly in love, and as such their gradual loss of reality soon contrasts with their early airy nature. Jane, the movie's lead figure (one wonders how women got dumped with occupying most lead roles in these stupid films) is nothing out of the ordinary; emotional, unable to escape the visions she's having and adamant in her craziness, she provides the film with its driving force; she's the one who asks questions and seeks answers. In such a way, Jane isn't so much a character as a plot device, cold and boring in every respect. Actress Rachael Taylor isn't incompetent in her role here, yet she never does anything remotely remarkable either; like her character, she blends in with the background far too much. Husband Ben again fails to stray too far from the workaholic, doubting companion figure yet at least actor Joshua Jackson shows a bit of personality in his performance. As a pair they are unconvincing both in their reaction to what is going on around them, and to what is bubbling around inside them; there's no love here, and while fear is present when needed, it always seems inconsequential.Perhaps the single greatest feature of Shutter lies in its score penned by Nathan Barr. While it certainly has its moments of blandness, every now again certain scenes are given extra depth and resonance through Barr's string pieces which create a sense of spiralling insanity on their own, even if the accompanying photography is everything but. For a movie about spirit photography, Shutter is surprisingly unconvincing through its medium, and Katsumi Yanagishima never takes advantage of the subject that he is photographing; there's no imagination present in how this film is shot, it just is, and it feels just as generic as the two or three other movies of similar style this year. And yet, this sentiment just about sums up the entirety of this latest instalment of creepy for the sake of creepy paranormal detective drama; perfunctory, predictable, tired and overly familiar, Shutter is sporadically interesting but such moments are far and few between. For fans of the genre, you could do worse, but one feels that Hollywood should give it a rest with these for a while, either to let them grow up or simply to come up with new ideas; Shutter has neither, it's White Noise and The Ring played with photos instead of tapes and audio. Unless you love this sort of thing, I suggest you give this one a miss.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)'\n",

            "Review: 'Shutter is a 2008 American supernatural horror film directed by Masayuki Ochiai. Its story follows newlywed couple Ben and Jane who has just moved to Japan for a promising job opportunity. After a tragic car accident that leads to the death of a young girl, Ben begins noticing strange blurs in many of his fashion shoot photographs, which Jane suspects are the spirit of the dead girl that they killed. The film stars Joshua Jackson, Rachael Taylor, and Megumi Okina.Shutter is almost worth watching if you favor the style, with Ochiai directing the film with calm assurance and Dawson's screenplay preserving most of the original script's strengths and fixes a couple of weaknesses. it also has the look and feel of a proper J-horror film but the film overall is workmanlike at best; derivative, predictable and dull. Strictly perfunctory in its concept and execution, Shutter presents the usual series of spooky images of a deadpan female ghost showing up at odd times and moving in the slow, jerky movements that are tiresome for the genre. The leads are rather good but ultimately the film becomes little more than a series of derivative, predictable genre conventions without the necessary skill to back them up.'\n",

Nevertheless, it´s so boring until the outcome when take a 360 degree turn and bring us something unexpected in the beggining. In spite of that, don't have jumpscares and neither create a frightening atmosphere to take the bystander attentive at the plot. Instead, appeals so much to the imagination and don't yield heavy emotions to the viewer. In summary, if you don't have anything to do and want to see how is it, go ahead but know that are movies that develop everything much better than this one.'\n",

            "Review: 'Unfortunately, I took seriously all the gushing comments about how Shutter (2004) was \"the best thing since The Ring\" and out of curiosity watched it back to back with the remake. The only thing fans of the original got right is how dismally bad the remake is.Shutter (2004) would have been a lot of fun in the 1980s, and I can understand why kids and people new to the genre like it so much, but there's not much here for those more experienced in the genre -- Asian horror, or horror in general. It's not a bad movie, but I've seen the same story so many times in earlier, lesser-known Asian horror movies that it didn't do anything for me. The scares are all textbook routines; again, done well, but done so many times before they're never a surprise. I put off seeing this for years because it sounded so generic, and it turned out I was right. That said, it's a masterpiece compared to the remake.Shutter (2008) is so poorly written and plotted that it could only have been made in-house by studio wonks who don't have to go through the slightest quality control regarding scripts or production skills to get the green light on a film project. Shutter (2008) would have insulted me as a moviegoer even if it weren't a remake. The characters are weakly written and performed (this should be a career-ender for Joshua Jackson), and the special effects are so cheesy they're embarrassing rather than scary.Now I see why this new version makes fans of the original so angry. I'm not even a fan of the original, but I found it frustrating that the remake ineptly ignores the only story-telling hook that made the original good enough to watch in the first place. Then it goes on to parrot some of the original plot points while skipping others that make them contextually relevant. The result is a jumble of pointlessness. No one involved in the making of this film had any idea what they were doing.Verdict: Shutter (2004) was a decent movie, but nothing special, and has little to offer more experienced moviegoers who'll find it rather dull. Shutter (2008) is an insult, not to the original, but to the movie-going public that studio execs must think are tasteless imbeciles who will watch whatever crap they're given.'\n",

The writing is lackluster, and has clearly been written with haste and was obviously doctored by three or more people. The acting isn't terrible, Joshua Jackson has always been convincing, even in a sh**ty role, and John Hensley of 'Fifty Pills' fame is a nice added touch. Rachael Taylor is a beautiful new face to me, but she isn't really anything to brag about, and I feel like she was probably only given the role because of her similarities to Naomi Watts. Upon a repeat viewing, I'll add that there far too many shots of Jackson and Taylor kissing and having romantic moments over absolutely *nothing*.No real scares to be had here at all, although I suppose if you were watching it alone late at night & if you scare particularly easily, the film does give off a creepy vibe in the scene with James Kyson Lee at the spirit photography office. Although, I must admit, I would much rather skip this film and just watch the episode of 'Celebrity Ghost Stories' with James Kyson Lee in it, because that is actually scary and is actually real.SHUTTER -----5/10.'\n",

The concept is flawed right out of the gate--why Japan? Because of the Japanese director? Japanese co-funding? Either way, the story just doesn't hold well in its Japanese reincarnation. The producers simply should've booked the writers/directors of the original; the new guy although Asian, has come up with a very generic horror remake. His pace is wrong, the casting isn't very convincing either. The editing is below mediocre, and the cinematography only so-so. Oh and even the score is a big fat cliché on its own. Whereas the original is really solid and takes its time, slowly building the plot, but not for a second letting you off the hook. Another thing--the Ghost here simply isn't scary, she's sort of bland. And the extreme creepiness of the final twist here is done completely wrong. A triumph of mediocrity, this remake.

            "Review: 'It's not easy to make a horror movie these days. The critics will hate it by definition: their expectations are always high and mostly unsatisfiable. They will call them uninspirational, uninteresting, and not original enough. With time, the horror genre has become an underdog of the movie industry. Prior to watching this movie, I had no knowledge about the plot whatsoever and it turned out to be good for me. I won't beat around the bush: I'm not a horror fanatic, but this one, I enjoyed from the beginning until the very end and I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. The thing I appreciated the most was the great amount of mystery: at some point the movie becomes more a mystery movie than a horror movie. The plot is interesting at the very least: and it does make you think who the main villain might be. I personally had many guesses and I though I got it right, but the ending surprised me. And there's nothing I enjoy more than an ending I did not see coming. The surroundings are beautiful and the movie is very well shot. Visually, the pictures are very satisfying, another thing you would not expect. The acting is also professional, along the score: all these parts, I have no complaints about. The movie was, for some reasons I don't fully understand, certified as not fresh enough. I do agree, some moments are painfully cliché, but in this case, I found it charming. Isn't it a part of the horror movie to expect that a hand will try to reach you under the bed? It will make you jump in your place either way, so what's the deal? As long it's not cheesy, it's good enough for me. I think that if the creators maybe took a risk and avoided those couple of clichés, the movie would have been praised by critics. But who cares about their opinion anyway? The movie is really enjoyable and if that is what matters to you, don't hesitate and watch it. You won't regret it.'\n",

            "Review: '\"The Uninvited\" is about teenager Anna (Emily Browning), who spent time in a psychiatry institution after the accidental death of her sickly mother in a fire. But after ten months, she returns home to her spacious New England house that rests on edge of the coast. While happy to be back with her older sister, Alex (Arielle Kebbel), she is not so happy with her father's (David Strathairn) new girlfriend, Rachael (Elizabeth Banks), a nurse who took care of her mother up until the accident, and is now living in her house. Rachael seems to be hiding something, and the girls become convinced that she was responsible for the fire that killed their mother. As they dig deeper into Rachael's past, more suspicions arise, and Anna finds herself being contacted by the ghosts of both her mother, and three mysterious children that have a connection to Rachael...I was somewhat skeptical going into this movie, seeing that it was a remake of the Korean \"A Tale of Two Sisters\", and the fact that it was a PG-13 horror movie, which is often a bad sign. But I was pleasantly surprised with \"The Uninvited\", because it ended up being much more than your typical teenage horror thriller. First off, the screen writing is wonderful here. The same \"evil stepparent\" setup has been done before, but there are a number of plot twists, turns of events, and nice little quirks that keep it from being too average. The film overall was really unpredictable in most respects, that is unless you have seen the original Korean film (which I have not, so I was very interested all along). The supernatural lacing in the story is well done too, combining ghosts and spirits with real-life danger that threatens our two leading ladies.The cinematography is impressive, and setting is remarkable too, as the entire film unfolds in the confines of a beautiful, large New England home that sits perched on the side of the rocky ocean cliffs, a location that gives plenty of space for creepy action to unfold. It's atmospheric because of this as well, and has a comfortable - yet, more often than not, creepy- feel to it. I like the fact that the film takes its time building itself, shying away from being too shocking and posing plenty of questions in its first act, and then kicking into gear in the second and tossing the shocking truth behind all of the events right at your face. The ever-tiring jump scares are limited here, with suspense being the more the main focus, which was really welcome and a change from the norm. The pacing is delectable, and the tension is present as it grows toward the climax, which is nothing short of jaw-dropping.Also, I'd like to mention the cast here. Emily Browning (of 2002's \"Ghost Ship\") plays the leading role as the curious and quiet younger sister, playing her role perfectly with the face of an angel. Arielle Kebbel is also very good as her older, party-loving (but serious) sister, who aids her in the uncovering of Rachael's past. Rachael herself, the devilish stepmother figure is played by Elizabeth Banks (whom I have seen mainly do comedy work), and manages to be threatening and elusive despite her good looks. Also notable is David Strathairn (whom I recognized from \"Dolores Claiborne\") as the unbelieving father. The ensemble of actors here is strong, and their chemistry with each other surprisingly really works, which I think added a lot to the film.As far as the ending is concerned, I won't spoil things, but it's clever, really. It completely came out of left field for me, and I was dumbfounded and giddy with anxiousness within the final ten minutes. Sure, similar plot twists have come about before - but it was really unexpected- and the funny thing is, after thinking about it, there are clues that are dropped along the way. Problem is, they're so subtle that the viewer doesn't even notice, and I really liked that. I was completely caught off-guard. And the final shot is an innocently creepy seal on the envelope of a clever and entertaining horror movie.Overall, \"The Uninvited\" is a very welcome change from the standard PG-13 horror pictures, and has the caliber of much more sophisticated horror movies. The classic horror atmosphere, creepy sets, and tense character interactions make this movie work, not to mention the twisted ending which is an unexpected smack in the face. \"The Uninvited\" is an enormously fun, well-constructed flick that retains an elegance that most horror movies nowadays (especially PG-13 thrillers) fail to achieve. (Also note: this film is in no relation to the 1940s ghost film of the same name) 9/10.'\n",

I liked to see in the Extras of the DVD the interview with the writers of the screenplay, producers and directors Charles and Thomas Guard since they have been very honest in their words recognizing the merits of the original Asian movie that was the base of their script. Further, they had the skill of using the original storyline with an intriguing supernatural and non-complicated plot and an excellent plot point that provides a satisfactory explanation for the events that triggered the whole process in Anna's mind. I do not recall seeing the sweet Emily Browning in another movie, but she proves that she is an excellent actress, participating in practically every scene and giving credibility to Anna. The efficient David Strathairn and Elizabeth Banks and the also unknown Arielle Kebbel have also great performances in this highly recommended supernatural feature.

This eerie movie produced by the successful director/producer Ivan Reitman displays terror, shocks, hard-edged drama , plot twists and creepy images . The story come to life in a wonderful fashion, giving it a haunting ominous atmosphere that often seems to mimic the tense relations between the members of the family . While the look is suitable atmospheric and scary , the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point in a surprising finale . The film is an American remake of successful Korean film titled ¨A tale of two sisters¨ by Ji Woon Kim . It also contains the usual spooky phantoms of pale complexion from Japanese stories directed by Takashi Mike and Hideo Nakata as ¨The Grudge ¨ , ¨ The ring ¨ and ¨ Dark water ¨ . The direction is incredibly good , production design by Andrew Menzies , the cinematography by Daniel Landin , lighting, and especially the soundtrack by expert on terror scores Christopher Young , all are captivating.

            "Review: 'Spoilers-ok, so the haters say this movie is predictable. I disagree. If you were able to guess what was happening in the first five minutes, like one reviewer said, congratulations, you're a genius. The twist is familiar, yes, but it was very cleverly done. All throughout the movie, the older sister is talking to other people. She talks to the dad, who seems to be looking at her, same with the girlfriend. She's there with the group when the boyfriend is found dead, and it looks like they have all been taking to the sheriff, including the sister. And the sister talks to several people on the telephone. They make it seem like she's really there, even though Anna is the only one actually talking to her. But the older sister seems to be the black sheep of the family, so this doesn't raise any red flags, for me at least. When it turns out that the older sister died in the fire with her mother...that was done brilliantly! The soon to be stepmother was never the bad guy after all. Actually, in my mind, there was no real bad guy. Anna was crazy, and she couldn't help what she did, so I feel sorry for her when she remembers everything. I even feel bad for the father, even though he's the one that started all this by fooling around with his wife's nurse. I mean, come on, dude, your wife is dying! You seriously can't keep it in your pants until after she passes? But in the end, he did lose everything; his wife, his fiancé, his older daughter, and in a sense, his younger daughter. He's alone in that great big house. Some may say he deserved it, but I feel sorry for him. Oh, and the way that those dead kids fit into the story, that was really well done.Now, some have commented on whether Anna was crazy to begin with, because of what she says at the end when she's back in the psych ward. She tells her doctor that she did what he told her to do; finish what she started. But I don't take this to mean that she was faking it this whole time. See, no one is a bad guy in their own mind. She has been through a horrible ordeal, and her brain needs to rationalize it; she was just following her doctor's orders. Now, some may think that when she decided to burn the house down with her father and his mistress in it, she was in her right mind. Again, I disagree. Someone in their right mind would barge in on them and start yelling, not immediately try to burn the house down. There was something wrong with Anna from the start.'\n",

            "Review: 'I haven't seen the original Tale of Two Sisters by Kim Ji-woon to begin with so I won't be able to do any meaningful comparisons. But if a remake is any indication of how the original is generally miles better, especially if done by Hollywood, hen it probably is worth my while to put the Korean horror movie in my to-watch list. After all, Kim Ji-woon's film is one of Korea's top box office draws when released.There have been more misses than hits when Hollywood adapts what it thinks could be instant box office gold with its fountain of Asian content, and since there have been only a limited number of successful Asian horror releases in recent years, it had looked inwards and cannibalized on remaking its own shock/slasher films. This one took a long while to translate to The Uninvited, and I guess taking some 6 years indicated the filmmakers wanted to do things right instead of rushing through and come out with crap.As such the directing duo of the Guard Brothers Charles and Thomas managed to find some balance between telling a psychological thriller, and moments where they can properly employ tricks from the usual formula book to scare an audience, with the usual light and shadows, smoke and mirrors, warped beings, decomposed bodies and jump cuts with ghouls staring down at you. Surprisingly it didn't rely on sound or lack thereof to add a further sensory dimension to set pulse racing, which I thought was a little let down in its moments to build up to the next \"Boo!\" If anything, the acting duo of Emily Browning (Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, with pouty lips to rival Angelina Jolie's, and given special attention too in this narrative) and Arielle Kebbel shine as skimpily clad sisters Anna and Alex respectively, who have to rely on each other as they uncover the truth behind the death of their mom (Maya Massar). It doesn't help of course with Anna just being certified sane and safe to be released from a mental institution, and their suspect happens to be their nanny-turned-new-step-mom-to-be Rachel (Elizabeth Banks) whom dad (David Strathairn) intends to marry. Given the short run time of under 90 minutes, the pace is kept compact with little room wasted to pump in unnecessary subplots (unless set up just to provide an additional avenue to unleash horrific mayhem), focusing very much of the relationship between the two sisters, and their strained one with their father. Emily Browning, as the lead, of course had enough latitude to showcase a double-head snake role in being \"nice\" to Rachel, in order for some fishing of information.That isn't to say there isn't any loophole that a jumbo jet can't fly through. Even if you have no background knowledge gained from the original Korean film, it is easy enough for sharp-eyed viewers, or those whose cinematic staple is horror films, to stay one step ahead and deduce just what is exactly going on. Which makes me wonder just how much it'll take for shockmeisters to scare seasoned audiences since they're getting savvier, and easily bored with the same old bag of tricks.If anything, The Uninvited would have piqued your interest in the original, which has a longer run time and in all likelihood, the exploitation of mood and atmosphere that are quite standard tools for horror films from Asia, which is sorely lacking in this version. Nonetheless it's still one of the better Western remakes of Asian horror attempted.'\n",

Steve deals with the loss through the kindness with benefits provided by his wife's caretaker, Rachel (Elizabeth Banks). \"With benefits\" doesn't always imply intimacy - but, in this case, it does imply exactly - that. Remember, it's an implication: nothing of a prurient nature is ever shown. Safe for kids who don't live in a boxSteve's wife had been suffering from an incurable malady that left her bed-ridden and in need of constant care. Rachel was hired to help take care of Steve's wife several days a week. Steve came home to find his wife had been consumed by a fire. The cause was listed as a faulty gas vakve that powered a household generator. Needless to say, he was likely distraught (this all happened before reel one was loaded in the camera, i.e., \"backstory\").Technically, Rachel's gig was finished. No more bed-ridden Mrs. Steve - no more job for Rachel. However, the kind-hearted(?) and quite stunning Rachel chooses to visit Steve three to four times a week to help him assuage his guilt, build up his strength, find meaning in life... perhaps increase his libido... It isn't long before Steve becomes enamored with the younger Rachel despite losing his wife to the fire several months earlier. I'm not judging!Rachel (Banks) and Steve soon become too close for comfort for Anna (Emily Brown), Steve's youngest daughter and the center of focus throughout the film. It is believed that this untimely relationship and other is what caused Steve's youngest daughter to attempt suicide by slitting her wrists. Though it might add a few review stars for horror fans to who just cannot get enough of self-administered exsanguination, we don't see this, nor do we need to.We meet young Anna after her post trauma rehabilitation and recovery. This is one of two characters the story ultimately focuses on: the doe-eyed young teenager... What we see, what we hear, and what we believe, are filtered through the mind of Anna. The second character? Rachel, of course. She is the interloper - but... is she the uninvited? Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games, et al), is a very capable actress. Her role as Rachel had to be tailored to be the Rachel the way Anna sees her.This may be why some reviewers might say there weren't adequate character arcs for the rest of the family. Again, the majority of the film is seen and interpreted through the eyes and mind of Anna, something that should become crystal clear in the latter scenes.Returning home to the Steve and Rachel show wasn't the homecoming Anna anticipated. Rachel tosses the idea out for a homecoming party or some other sort of transparent ploy to prove \"I'm your awesome new mom!\" That never works. Anna is indifferent until she notices the interior of the kitchen has been remodeled.Anna is dismayed that the extensive remodeling took away the \"essence\" and memories of Anna's mother, including a chalkboard attached to the kitchen wall. Asking where all of her mother's furnishings and belongings are, Rachel tells her they are in the attic. Nothing scary happens in attics, right? Right?Later, Anna and Alexa talk about the infamous chalkboard. It was like mom's giant iPad. They laughed at their mother's terrible handwriting that listing chores and scheduled events for the day.It isn't long before Anna makes a bold statement to Rachel by replacing the chalkboard, hammering a partial hole through the drywall. Two women, years apart in age, have met their match. Who will prevail?Anna, with help from her older sister, Alexa, use their own research from clues left by her burned and charred apparition of a mother, begin piecing together a story that seems to prove that Rachel isn't who she says she is. Tracing back medical licenses Some of these clues are expressed to Anna by an unknown young freckle-faced girl with long red hair, Who is she? Why is she there one second, gone the next? All In good time...If I continue, I'll ultimately write a synopsis of the film.The bottom line is simple. All that I wrote is what you will see. You might even try to predict the ending. You won't. Procedural is predictable, unless it's \"The Uninvited.\"\"The Uninvited,\" is a great watch on two levels. Adults and teens will pick up on clues and, if observant, find out early on that things aren't always what they appear to be. It's a fun and at times frightening film.The PG-13 crowd has seen more blood and gore on video game commercials. If the kids want a good scary movie, this one will satisfy. It's nothing close to a meat cleaver, gallons of squirting blood slasher flick. It's about fear... and that fear is contagious!You could've watched half the movie already! No more reviews. Select \"The Uninvited,\" invite your loved ones (or your cat/dog/) to the couch - and hit PLAY.See you at the movies...'\n",

            "Review: 'This was a pretty good fright flick. It kept the viewer engaged right up to the ending and while it seemed somewhat formulaic in terms of plot development and things that go bump in the night, it had plenty of scary moments and more than served its purpose, which was a few hours of entertainment.Most of the movie deals with the relationship of sisters Anna and Alex with Rachel, the girlfriend of their father. Anna thinks Rachel murdered their late mother and possibly was behind some earlier unsolved murders. However, Anna was recently released from a mental institution and has some emotional issues that raises more suspicions about her than about Rachel. On the other hand, Rachel has some questionable aspects about her past that don't seem quite right. This guessing game continues until the dramatic ending.The screenplay was very good, the cinematography captured the rocky coastline of Maine nicely, and the film was helped by good performances from Elizabeth Banks as Rachel, David Strathairn as the father, and Emily Browning as Anna.This was a good horror movie well worth checking out.'\n",

            "Review: 'While many people are just so put off by this film for many reasons, I was very surprised by how it actually turned out.Although the original, \"A Tale of Two Sisters\", was an epic movie that delivered certain moods and feelings that this movie (and most other films to date) couldn't quite capture, this film was still just great.One thing to understand was that this movie was completely westernized. Remakes such as \"The Grudge\" take place in Japan, but the main characters are replaced with an American or European cast, and sometimes the story just doesn't quite fit the way it should with that type of a cast. In this film, the \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" story is completely translated into an American setting, in the north in a small town. The characters are tweaked a little to accommodate the new setting, and so are some of the scenes and plot lines. This is where many fans of the original get upset and get their panties in a bunch.If this film was truly remade true to the original, it would just be the original film itself being remade 5 years later with the same cast and same script. This film is honestly one of the best Asian-horror remakes that has been made in the past 3 or 4 years if not ever. The cast gives solid performances and there were little or no plot holes. There were actually less plot holes in this film than the original. Of course I liked the original more, but I'm just saying this film executed certain things that the first film didn't, just like the first film executed certain things this film didn't. They are meant to be similar but different, and that is what makes both of them worth seeing.8.5/10'\n",

I only realised when reading the IMDb reviews afterward that this is a remake of a film I'd already seen. Plus at 65 mins I'd written off the story as a spooked up Nancy Drew caper, albeit produced with plenty of style and quality.The last 10 minutes were a shock to me, and this is coming from a fan of Mulholland Dr. I was looking for clues, assuming the baddie couldn't be the obvious one, but got tired thinking about the year 1996 and fastened my seatbelt to settle in for a routine landing. Now I'm going to have to rewatch to see how skillfully the clues were laid. And rewatch the original too.Almost everything is quality - performances, direction, editing, cinematography - except the music is just OK, a bit cliche. And I have doubts about the writing. While the dialogue between the sisters is often impressive, the father's character is frustratingly dull, and even the twist ending can't change him. Plus I'm not convinced the main character is psychologically true. I'll see when I get round to it again.Overall: unexpectedly mixed experience.'\n",

Upon returning to her father's mansion on the coast of Maine, she reunites with her older sister (Arielle Kebbel) and tries to get along with her dad's new girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks), her mother's former nurse, who appears to be taking over. David Strathairn plays the father, a successful author.\"The Uninvited\" (2009) is a mystery/horror that combines elements of \"The Sixth Sense\" (1999), \"Half Light\" (2006) and \"The Ring\" (2002), although it's a little more subdued than the latter. If you like the haunting tone of those movies and the spectacular locations of the latter two, you'll appreciate it. Browning with her ultra-cute face was 20 during filming, but looks 14. Meanwhile Banks is effective as the biyatch gold-digger and Strathairn is convincing as the clueless father.The story plays out in a too-predicable manner. If you saw the trailer beforehand it basically tells you everything you need to know. But not really: The last 15 minutes pulls the rug out with some surprising revelations. I heard there was a twist before viewing and went over various possibilities in my mind while watching, but the movie fooled me. Great job on this front. Not everything is as it appears. I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it.My relatively high rating is due to the lingering power of the film's message on individual perception. It's potent and applicable stuff, expertly executed.The film doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 27 minutes. It wasn't shot in the Northeast, however, but obviously British Columbia (Bowen Island). It's an American remake of the Korean film \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" (2003).GRADE: B+/A-'\n",

            "Review: 'After being cleared for release from a mental hospital, Anna (Emily Browning) returns home to her writer father Steven (David Strathairn) and sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel). In her absence, Emily's father has grown closer to her late mother's former caretaker Rachel (Elizabeth Banks). Anna is continually hallucinating and seeing her dead mother, insisting that her death was not an accident and that Rachel had something to do with it. With this in mind, she sets out with Alex to prove Rachel is not everything she seems.I did not expect much from The Uninvited, but surprisingly, I received a lot more than I expected.Despite being an American remake of the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters, The Uninvited does enough to make it stand out on its own. I never saw the original film, but I imagine it looked different than this film does. It is dark and atmospheric from the very beginning, and continues on the same wavelength to the very end of the film. It frequently blends horror with psychological terror, developing a movie that could have easily been a throwaway scare-flick for pre-teens to scream through, but ends up being a fairly accomplished film. This is not a film anywhere near the quality of the greatness found in the likes of The Silence of the Lambs, but it is a film that was not just scraped out for a profit.The story itself, as twisty and loopy as it gets, is fairly well done. Although I was not too interested at the beginning, the film draws you in rather tightly, revealing itself quite nicely over its short 87-minute running time. Yes, there are plenty of predictable moments laced throughout the film, but there are a few moments of genuine surprise as well. The film never makes the claim that it is trying to be original, but it does a unique enough job that you can only see shades of what has come before (as opposed to a standard American horror film basically spelling out exactly what it is ripping off, or homaging sort to speak). Even with the cheap scares around every corner, it still managed to make me jump back more than once.What does not make sense however, is how some things are explicitly stated while others are briefly alluded to. A lot of what happens is fairly obvious for even the least astute of audiences, yet the film dumbs itself down more than once to fit the conventions of 2000-era PG-13 horror. When something ambiguous comes up, it is either explained in-depth, or done away with entirely. A rather crucial character element of Anna's is revealed very close to the beginning of the film, but is never explored in any capacity. We understand her motivations and what drives her quest for the truth, but there are a few background details that even after the film concludes, still left me a bit baffled. Why explain some things that are obvious, but not bother touching on ones that are not? Despite not having starred in a lot of things, Browning is quite good in her role as Anna. Struggling throughout the film with mental anguish and hallucinations, Browning makes this young teenage character convincing in a way only someone so young could do. She is not perfect in the role, but you can see the desperation and heartbreak in her face and her actions. This is an actress who becomes her role, and never falters out of it. She carries the film from beginning to end, and never looks the worst for it. She is a young actress I hope to continue to see more of, especially in higher fare.Kebbel, while not as powerful as Browning, commands when she is on-screen. She works beautifully off of Browning, and makes their relationship clear and pure from their first moment together. Their chemistry makes the film as surprising as it is. It easily could have been something that was clouded over, or underplayed. But the filmmakers use every opportunity to stress the strength of the relationship of the two sisters, and their willingness to go the distance for each other. Some moments are just heartbreaking, seeing the lengths they are willing to go, but Kebbel keeps herself in check at all times, and gives a great performance.Strathairn, despite the Oscar-nomination for Good Night, and Good Luck., seems to have fallen on being the wise older character in every movie since, and gives the same old performance here. He is good as always, but seems more mellowed down than he should be. Banks on the other hand, is completely out of her comfort zone, and her performance is an obvious reflection. In some scenes, she is downright terrifying as the evil potential stepmother, and in others, she is laughably bad. There is no middle ground, and no one seems to have been able to suggest any consistency tips for her. While she gives a decent performance anyway, it could have been stronger with a more confident actress.But what the film is guilty of is its lack of reinvention. It is a unique piece of horror for 2009, but the film never strives to be anything bigger or better. It lacks the motivations to really make something of itself, and never even tries to be something better than it could be. The Uninvited really surprised me for how good it actually was, but surprised me more in how easily it could have been even better. A lean running time, a great pair of young actresses, and some decent supporting acting could have made this small picture quite the notorious horror flick. But instead, it seems content just being an above average run-of-the-mill psychological thriller.7/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).'\n",

They completely revamped it, probably because they thought American audiences were too attention deficit to sit through a real psychological thriller without a linear plot that was explained to death. They also must have thought that the concept of vengeful spirits was too scary for us because they turned it into another lame overdone psycho killer movie. They took an intense and creepy ghost story and mutilated it. What they ended up with was a movie that was boring, tedious, and predictable. Don't waste your money seeing or renting this one.'\n",

Anna is a bit discouraged when finding that her father(David Stratham)is engaged to her mother's caretaker Rachel(Elizabeth Banks).

The film's music score is extremely effective at creating a suspenseful and uneasy viewer sensation, which I think deserves full appreciation for the movie's ghostly flavor. Without any doubt, appropriate music in a movie is like butter on popcorn. Would Jaws scare you without the renowned theme music? The cast was nothing less then superb. Emily Browning was perfect at playing the \"sad, quiet girl with horrible visions\" role. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but the ending of this movie really twists your mind and makes you think.

            "Review: 'Psychological horror with supernatural elements, The Two Sisters Mystery is the American remake of Fear (Janghwa, Hongryeon, 2003), South Korean cult director Jee-woon Kim. Charles Guard and Thomas Guard direct the new version, which stars Emily Browning (Sleeping Beauty) and Arielle Kebbel (The Vampire Diaries). As happens in most cases, the remake doesn't surpass the original. But it has its merits, and it's still a good pastime. Its American version is what we usually expect from reproductions that are basically copies of someone else's work: fun, with intriguing moments, but very obvious. As obvious as it is, the film is more like a video explaining the ambivalent traits of the South Korean, as it builds its narrative based on our interpretation of the possible issues raised by the oriental production and its path towards an open outcome.The film begins with teenager Anna (Browning) being released from a mental hospital where she has spent the past 10 months. Anna attempted suicide after her mother died in a fire. And the trauma caused the girl's brain to block part of the memories of the tragedy. Her father Steven (David Strathairn, from Stronger Than Bombs) welcomes her with open arms in the family's rural residence. But what Anna really wants is to reunite with Alex (Kebell), the rebellious party sister whose opinions are constantly ignored by her father. But going home also brings some problems for our little protagonist. One is having to live with Rachel (Elizabeth Banks, from Brightburn: Son of Darkness), her mother's ex-nurse, who has now been leveraged to daddy's girlfriend status. The other is being haunted by ghosts, which makes Anna suspect that her would-be stepmother is hiding dark secrets. Was the fire that killed her mother really an accident?The Uninvited is a curious product. Fruit of a late crop of American remakes based on Asian works (in this case, the 2003 Korean feature Fear), the film offers very little beyond what we've already seen in the same genre, moving considerably away from the original material and failing, in the at the same time, in creating any identity of its own. The plot, at first, is confused with examples ranging from The Scream to The Devil's Spine, efficient horrors about ghosts and curses. However, this feature doesn't stand on its own story, appealing at all times to the cheesiest clichés of horror cinema, such as the existence of adult characters that don't give credit to the younger ones, as well as several jumpscares based on the sudden increase of the soundtrack. If the film is not so committed, it is because of its main assets: photography that bets on dark tones and angles that reinforce the isolation of those characters, as well as the performances of Emily Browning, beautiful and totally at ease as the protagonist of a horror film, exhibiting fragility and strength at the right times; and Elizabeth Banks (Creeping Beings), who also convinces as the \"villain\" of the plot, without committing excesses in its composition.The film is divided between family drama, Anna and Alex's investigations and moments of supernatural horror. The ghostly apparitions range from scary children to hairy creepy woman, in line with j-horror productions. But there is still room for a deformed figure that refers to Zelda, from Cemitério Maldito. Practical effects and makeup are good. Violence is moderate, but gains a certain strength in the last act. As already mentioned, the Guard brothers constantly resort to jump scares. Some even work. But the film scares even more when the terror is accompanied by silence, as in that scene where the protagonist notices a creature hidden in a dark corner of her room. Christopher Young's soundtrack is good and one of the highlights of the plot, with some tracks being outstanding.This isn't a horror movie in which you'll be scared a lot, it's a thriller, one of those that we were quite intrigued during the course of it. The most important factor in this cinematographic genre is perhaps, for many, the climate in which the narrative is built, and this point is essential to make this a great film. But there's not just suspense surrounding him, there's also mystery. Even though the script leaves clues from the beginning, mainly trying to deceive the audience with very evident false clues taking the viewer's eye in a direction, the ending ends up being predictable in relation to who \"isn't\" the villain of the story. The question was really about how the facts unfolded. Longtime horror movie fans are likely to end the riddle before its time, not least because the screenplay by Craig Rosenberg, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard delivers some clues that make this task easier. If you can't catch them, you're sure to be surprised by the final twist.The Uninvited, directed by Charles and Thomas Guard, is the kind of movie worth seeing at least twice; the first for the pleasure of the story, the second to see how everything is conducted following its own logic. I believe that a film is a universe closed in on itself. The rules he creates, from the first frame to the final scene, are valid only for the duration of the film, and it is through this set of parameters that we must judge the unfolding of a plot. In this sense, I consider The Uninvited honest enough with what he proposes. The characters' attitudes, the way they interact and the decisions they make follow a logic determined by the point of view adopted in the narrative.We have some crucial moments in the script, where the acting must be good to be able to convey to the viewer what the script wants. In general, the biggest burden was on Browning, which at the time of its release and still very young, already demonstrated that it was more than capable of carrying a film on its back. The way Emily Browning's character evolves is interesting, trying to convince herself more and more that she's not freaking out, and dreading going back to the madhouse. The actress' charisma helps the audience feel sorry for poor Anna.Craig Rosenberg, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard's screenplay explores the fine line between reality and fantasy. The ending is absolutely twisted, makes the spectator revisit several events of the film, trying to understand what happened, and then everything is explained. In fact, it will be a surprise for everyone who sees the movie. It's interesting when a movie convinces us that the characters are acting in the way they think is right, and then shows us how wrong we are. Don't expect graphic violence or lots of deaths, because there's hardly any.The Guard brothers do a job just right, without innovations, betting on insurance, but they show their inexperience. This is a psychological thriller, where scenes with ghosts are well applied, but not frightening. Suspense works well, you're always wondering what's coming next. This is a tight movie due to its short duration, which doesn't leave time for some characters to develop and the story to explain itself better. Still, it's a thriller worth seeing for Emily Browning's good acting, suspense, good story and sad and unexpected ending. Probably, if guided by more experienced directors, it would be a great movie. Recommended for thrillers, anyone looking for much more than that might be disappointed.'\n",

            "Review: 'I recognised the title of this scary movie, I didn't realise it was a remake of a Korean movie A Tale of Two Sisters, despite it being rated low by critics, I became more interested because of the names I recognised in the cast, so I gave it a chance. Basically after the death of her ill mother (Maya Massar), who was killed in a fire in the boathouse, teenager Anna (Emily Browning) tried to commit suicide, slitting her wrists, and she was sent to a mental institution for treatment. Ten months later, Anna still cannot remember what happened the night of the fire, but psychiatric Dr. Silberling (Dean Paul Gibson) discharges her, saying she has resolved her issues. Her father Steven (David Strathairn), a successful writer, brings her back home in an isolated mansion nearby the coast, she finds that her mother's former nurse Rachel Summers (Elizabeth Banks) is now her stepmother. Anna is reunited with her beloved sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel), and they become suspicious that it was Rachel that was responsible for her mother's death in the boathouse fire. Anna starts having vivid dreams about her mother, and flashes of the fire, and she is also terrified by ghosts who haunt, but she interprets to be a warning. Anna and Alex work together to find evidence and prove to Steven and the authorities that Rachel is using a fake identity, they believe she is actually Mildred Kemp, a nanny who killed the three children she looked after because of her obsession with the widowed father. An a also catches up with old boyfriend Matt (Jesse Moss), he knows the truth about what happened the night of the fire. He agrees to meet her later to talk about it, but he does not show up, and his body is pulled out of the water, his back broken. Steven ignores Anna's theories, but she confronts Rachel about what she knows, including evidence that she stole pearls belonging to the widowed man's wife, Rachel catches the sisters and sedates Alex. Anna escapes and goes to the police, but they do not believe her claims, assuming it is her meantal issues returning, they sedate her and take her home. When Anna wakes up, Alex has killed Rachel thrown her body into a dumpster, Steven arrives and asks what happened, Anna explains that Rachel tried to murder her and her sister, but Alex saved them. Steven is confused, he explains that Alex died in the fire along with their mother, Anna is holding the bloody knife, and Alex disappears. Anna finally remembers what happened the night of the fire, she caught her father and Rachel having sex, enraged she filled a watering can from the large gasoline tank in the boathouse, intending to set it on fire, the tap was not turned off properly, a falling candle ignited, her mother and Alex were killed in the explosion. Anna had been hallucinating Alex since she returned home from the institution, she killed Matt (Jesse Moss), letting him fall in the water and breaking his back, and she killed Rachel, who was surprisingly a kinder than she assumed. Anna is arrested for Rachel's murder, Steven talks to a police officer, explaining that Rachel did change her name, but to escape an abusive boyfriend, and at the institution, the patient in the room opposite Anna is revealed to be Mildred Kemp (Heather Doerksen). Also starring Kevin McNulty as Sheriff Emery, Don S. Davis as Mr. Henson and Lex Burnham as Iris. The acting is fine, most of the attempted jump scares come from the sudden appearances of disfigured spectres, the psychological stuff of the original source material sort of remains, and I will admit I was surprised by the twists and turns along the way, but it is trying almost too hard to be scary, and it is slightly bland, like something you may have seen before, but it is not a completely terrible horror thriller. Okay!'\n",

            "Review: 'THE UNINVITED is ANOTHER redundant remake of an Asian horror, the original in question this time being the Korean A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. If it wasn't for the original movie, this wouldn't be bad at all, coming across as a mildly spooky horror/mystery combo with a decent twist at the end.Sadly, having seen the original first (thank goodness) I can report that this is the inferior film in every respect. It feels like it's been dumbed down for US audiences, the narrative simplified and the mystery reduced to its most basic levels, a simple whodunit-style murder yarn with a couple of ghostly scenes thrown in for good measure.The problem with THE UNINVITED is that it fails to be scary - the couple of ghost scares we're treated to having been too obviously copied on the likes of THE GRUDGE - and the acting isn't much to write home about. I didn't mind Emily Browning's protagonist so much, while David Strathairn is great given the right role (as in THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM) but wasted here while Elizabeth Banks is completely over the top and detracts from it. The twist ending would have been great if we hadn't seen it all before, leaving THE UNINVITED far from the worst of the remakes out there, but hardly a great movie in itself.'\n",

            "Review: '\"The Uninvited\". Good movie. Scary? Not really. Worth seeing? Yes, definitely. But most fans of the original \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" will probably hate it. Before watching this I did read the plot. It may have been stupid to do so and it did spoil the movie. But let me tell you, it was still a good experience at the theaters.The acting was...brilliant. Especially Browning. I really liked the cinematic effect. The cinematographer, Dan Landin, did an excellent job. The lighting was good. The camera angles were good. The sound was also good thanks to the Sound Department. \"The Uninvited\" is very different and unique. It may have a few cliché jumps and scares, but in the end it was really worth seeing. So if you're wanting to see a meaningful movie of vengeance and reality, watch this one. You'll be happy you did.'\n",

            "Review: '2009 has already seen a great supply of horror films, with The Unborn and My Bloody Valentine headlining the bunch. Enter 'The Uninvited', an original thriller with some mildly scary moments that is not a horrible way to spend 2 hours. The film borrows from a few other films while forging a decent identity of its own, thus making it somewhat memorable and by no means terrible.The film deals with a girl (the beautiful Emily Browning) who is released from a psychiatric facility months after being involved in a terrible tragedy. When she returns to find her father (David Strathairn) in the arms of a new woman (Elizabeth Banks), she begins to doubt her family, her life, but never her sanity as she looks to find something against her future step mother.The biggest allure of this film is that it has a massive plot twist in the end that really excuses the film from the somewhat weird performance of Elizabeth Banks. The film is a great psychological exercise, and the twist really makes her performance much better once you understand why her character was so weirdly over the top at moments. I felt Browning did an excellent job of making us side with her character, while making her just mysterious enough to doubt her. It really kept me on my toes. David Strathairn is going through the motions in a role that almost any decent actor could play. His only job in the film is to pretend to be in love with Elizabeth Banks, and we all know how hard that is.Really, there isn't too much going on here with 'The Uninvited'. It does nothing new, but a lot of things right. Hell, the twist will remind you of a couple of other thrillers that seem supernatural, as the film is. I did enjoy the film's score a lot, and I appreciated that the film didn't take the general cliché route. In the modern (slightly) horror/thriller, it becomes all to easy to just borrow way too much from other films, become the 'Eagle Eye' of the genre, and become laughable in the end. Fortunately, in my theater of about 25 people, the film got just one mild and feeble laugh, and a lot more yelps of surprise.In the end, 'The Uninvited' is worth a look if you have some time on your hands, and is the exception, not the rule, to the long standing beliefs about films released in January. I should also mention that every main character is very easy on the eyes, especially Browning, who is simply stunning in every scene. Yes, even the one where she...well, you should see it to find out for yourself.'\n",

            "Review: 'Teenage girl Anna lost her mind and had to be institutionalized after her terminally ill mother died in an accidental house fire. We catch up with Anna as she meets for the final time with her psychologist and is released.She returns to her dad and her sister Alex. But dad has a new woman in his life, Rachael. Anna is very suspicious of Rachel. Alex not so much. Anna keeps having nightmares about her mom and also sees ghosts: her mom sometimes, at other times 3 children, 2 boys and a girl. Anna has good reason for distrusting Rachael since Rachael tries to isolate Anna from others, and also his dad from everyone else. A guy, who used to be Anna's old flame wants to talk to her, but he ends up dead.As her suspicion grows and is ratified by warnings she gets from the ghosts, their relationship becomes more strained and even threatening. The father, of course, always sides with his squeeze. Fortunately, Alex is also noticing that Rachael has a dark side. So the girls decide to prove that she is up to no good.But a whole lot more happens in the final act aside from unmasking Rachael; we find out the identity of the ghosts, and what happened on the night the mother died. Then there's also a couple of surprising twists that make you see the whole movie in a new light, and also makes you wonder if the story makes sense given the twist.The story itself is nothing new. But the twists at the end make things fresh and interesting. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare them. What makes this movie particularly enjoyable is the attractive female cast, the good acting, and the cinematography. There are a couple of good scares as well. But I particularly enjoyed how this movie was shot. It's bright, sharp, crisp, and well-lit, it takes place in nice surroundings. So it's not using visuals to make up for a defective story, rather it has a solid story and is beautiful to look at. The relationships are realistic and the script calls for normal reasonable people. There's no overacting, hysterical non-stop screaming, and best of all, no annoying teens delivering their lines as fast as they can. It's an interesting combination between normalcy and madness. And it doesn't hurt that all the girls are gorgeous.'\n",

            "Review: 'Man... How do I put this without sounding unhinged...Okay, first and foremost, ANY time I wish to read about a film that I am interested in I ALWAYS read the 'External' reviews first, which for me personally especially where Horror films are involved, I rely on COMPLETELY as opposed to the 'User' reviews. Those are usually much more balanced and you can count of the fact that they are genuine and NOT 'plants'. Admittedly, Horror is EXTREMELY subjective, so perhaps some may enjoy this film; although I'm sorry, but I must admit that I most certainly did not, and to me at least some of these 'rave reviews' are so calculatingly worded as to how 'wonderful' the film is in EVERY way that it makes me a bit nauseous. I don't know, maybe I just have a bad case of gas...For what it's worth, at least for my personal taste, ANY time there is a Horror film that catches my eye I always try to see if 'Slasherpool's site has reviewed it, because many times I do agree with their taste and their reviews. This one had 1 star out of a possible 5. He had seen the original and felt that this one was a complete travesty by comparison. He also stated that as a stand alone film not taking into account the original, that it was just very poor instead of abysmal. Just thought I'd share that, since I don't know how many take the time to read the 'External Reviews. To me, his are usually right on the nose and what I really appreciate about his reviews is that whether it is a tame PG-13 film like this one or a horrendous Slasher film, he treats them all equally as to their cinematic merits. (***UPDATE: Sadly, since my writing this, the site no longer exists :(Now, from MY standpoint. First off, the reason I even give this film 2 stars is because the production values and photography and the technical aspects of it are very good. But... sadly, that is about it. Primarily I just did NOT like the acting at all; sure, Strathairn is an excellent actor, but right from the beginning, Emily Browning's acting in the Psychiatrists office, her little predictable 'pensive' and 'ooh, do you really think so' expressions, etc., just did NOT ring true to me at all at any level whatsoever. The interaction between the two sisters including the 'acting' of the other sister, pretty much the same thing. The direction... Well, I don't know, maybe it's personal preference but I just felt we were being led along a very, VERY predictable path from the first scene in her bedroom after she had gone to sleep (not giving any specifics away of course) Honestly, the whole thing just felt like complete cardboard. Like 'Okay, let's show how scared she is... okay now lets play the scary sounds... okay now lets build up the 'suspense'...' Sorry, the film just did absolutely NOTHING for me. Didn't care, wasn't moved, didn't like the girl at all...It strikes me that perhaps what was sorely missing was a GENUINE atmosphere. I just did not FEEL it at all. Her reactions were completely 'plastic' and unbelievable, which could have been the fault of the director either not bringing the right performance out of her (because she IS supposed to be a good actress) or perhaps in the editing, choosing the wrong takes, I don't know. It just wasn't working for me...So, what we are left with is a very nice looking movie with good production values, but completely unmoving, sterile, unrealistic and unbelievable. The interactions between characters are artificial. The film has absolutely NO atmosphere at all, which is COMPLETELY unforgivable for a Ghost Story...'\n",

            "Review: 'Brace yourselves - here comes another one of those 'orrible 'uns! With some notable exceptions (Unforgiven, The Untouchables, The Unbearable Lightness Of Being), movies sporting the prefix 'un' in their titles are frequently hostages to fortune. On the one hand, they're more interesting-sounding than, say 'The Born', 'The Faithful' or 'The Canny' (and somewhere in a parallel universe there exists a John Wayne western called 'The Defeated'). On the other hand, the very application of those negative prefixes can ironically hasten the film's undoing. Which is unfortunate. And obviously undesirable.Such is the fate of The Uninvited, another all-too inevitable K-horror remake. Here, young Anna (Australian actress Emily Browning) returns home after a year's spell in a psychiatric clinic, following the devastating death of her invalid mother in a housefire. Along with her elder, spunkier sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) she's soon warring with her frosty-knickered stepmother, and mom's former live-in nurse, Rachael (a miscast Elizabeth Banks, in Hand That Rocks The Cradle mode).In a scenario that would have Sigmund Freud jumping up and down and furiously pulling his beard, Anna becomes convinced that Rachael did away with her ailing charge and is plotting to kill the daughters next, the better to have dad (David Strathairn) all to her self. Meanwhile, a creeping dread pervades their New England coastal home - ghostly children, the old hands-round-the-edge-of-the-bedcovers routine and charred manifestations of mum, all seeming to point to Rachael's culpability. Is Anna actually onto something? Or did somebody sign the wrong release form? Like Identity, The Sixth Sense or Secret Window, this is one of those two-for-one deals necessitating, so producers hope, an immediate return visit once the pleasantly deceived audience has, or thinks it has, 'got it'. Unlike most of these Hollywood riddle-me-rees however, there's little that was formulaic or pat about 2003's powerful and poignant A Tale Of Two Sisters (aka Janghwa, Hongryeon).We actually cared about put-upon sisters Su-Mi and Su-Yeon, so that the pleasing 'aha!' moment, when it arrived, was severely tempered by an almost unbearable sense of grief. Much of this came down to the quality of the acting, in particular a pair of performances of astonishing subtlety and maturity from the young leads. And perhaps uniquely, among this era's crop of South-East Asian horrors, it managed to Tazer the nerves while gently breaking your heart.The Guard brothers' remake, by contrast, is the usual exercise in jump-scares and PG-13 thrills, more concerned with getting to the twist as swiftly as possible, like a conjuror who remembers he's left the iron on the moment he takes the stage. Depth and characterisation suffer accordingly - though the waifish Browning impresses; a tiny pink flower with fraying petals turned in on themselves. She has an unusual, interesting face, and an assured future, at least, in playing damaged poppets. Hopefully, she'll soon put such bland fare behind her; although Banks and Srathairn should frankly be sent to bed without any supper. At the film's pre-release press screening, the final reveal elicited a single, irritated 'Tch!' from some anonymous critic in the dark. That little noise pretty much sums up this entire production.'\n",

I wish I could have that money back right about now. I was expecting a thriller that would me keep me guessing, maybe surprise me and of course scare me just a little at least. I was let down. We get a not so suspenseful 'thriller/horror' that to be honest didn't scare me one little bit. Seriously. The performances are pathetic in my opinion and by half way through this flick I have already lost interest sad to say. There is some comic relief, one scene, including a vibrator, which doesn't fit in. The vibrator was probably employed to wake up the audience members who, like me, we're falling asleep half –way through. Sorry, didn't work. The ending is what some people find so enjoyable about this flick, but I find it confusing as hell. So the girl is mental and she was imagining the entire story. This is a twist that for one thing is not original in the slightest, and two the filmmakers seem to forget if there is no engaging material for 90% of the movie, a plot twist isn't going to change the final verdict.'\n",

            "Review: 'There is a fine line between a movie that is all about the twist, and a movie that is itself a twist. The latter almost always unfolds more intelligently and avoids the gimmicky aura that surrounds less effective horror/thrillers that are either preposterous at the climax or succumbs to far too much exposition of the workings behind the twist. While The Uninvited, a remake of the Asian film A Tale of Two Sisters, is by no means flawless, it is however tense, well acted and boasts one of the best and most unexpected twist endings since last years The Orphanage. What makes The Uninvited so effective is its gradual snowballing of events and subtle revelations and seeming lack of intentional misdirection. Many horror films come off very manipulative, and leads the audience by the nose wherever is necessary to complete its twist. This debut film by the Guard Brothers on the other hand is anything but a pretentious swindle, existing merely for a final hurrah. The Uninvited is straightforward and relies on revelations by those involved and only holds back what the main character herself cannot remember. Some fires just won't die. Such is true in the memory of young Anna (Emily Browning) who is haunted by the memory of night a year earlier that claimed her bed ridden mother. Concluding a stint at a mental hospital following the accident Anna returns to her father's lakeside home for a summer of relaxation with her dad, Steven (David Straithairn) and sister, Alex (Arielle Kebbel). There is however an unwelcome presence in the home, her father's new girlfriend Rachael who was a former caretaker of her mother (Elizabeth Banks). Coupled with her general dislike of dad's new girlfriend, Anna feels something is wrong with Rachel, and with the help of Alex, the two uncover some troubling evidence. Alex is spurred further yet by the need to explain terrible nightmares and ghostly visions she experiences, which seem to carry a sinister message about her mother's death.Perhaps the best thing about The Uninvited is how it ties in its supernatural element. The visions and spectres add some truly creepy moments to the story and all tie into the finale in excellent fashion. The cast are all impeccable, although Straithairn seems curiously lost at times and it is certainly refreshing to watch characters that actually look their age. Impeccably shot, acted and boasting a finale that is as gripping and disturbing as it is shocking,The Uninvited is the best film of this young year.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com'\n",

If I were to compare this to the #1 movie it solely mimics, it would be an absolute spoiler. Alas, we shouldn't harp on that, after all, there's like maybe one more plot twist to get \"surprised\" by.Anna (Browning) has been locked away since her mother's died in a guest house-fire and, believe it, she can't remember what happens. Regardless, oddly enough, the psychologist says she's free to go. Back at home, she's reunited with Dad, sister and her father's girlfriend (Banks.) Wow, she's so good to be true. Nothing could go wrong when she's around.Enter in a boring subplot of a \"boyfriend\" and the sister egging on mischievous behavior does not make a great movie. In fact, it's a rather boring \"which dead child-ghost\" will pop up next and how the over-actor Browning will react to sauce under the oven.Mercifully, the movie's under 1½ hours long, but unfortunately, since the \"twists/turns\" are seen from a MILE away, it's painful to get to the conclusion. I can say the movie was beautifully shot with great locations. There, that was the one positive. Banks made me laugh on how coy she played \"suspicious.\" Even Strathairn, normally a very good actor, sleepwalked through his so-called \"confused, angry and distant Dad.\" Rip up your invitation. There's dozens of movies that this movie's based on that are 10x better. Again, to even mention them, will ruin this movie. Of course, the movie, itself, did a fine job of digging its own grave.'\n",

I was willing to give the \"remake\", The Uninvited, a chance and put it on this afternoon and could not believe my eyes.This \"remake\" does not deserve even 1 point out of 10 on the IMDb. What absolute disgusting garbage! ANYONE who has seen the Korean film would be mortified to watch the American version. There is no comparison at all. It would be like going into a restaurant and asking for Prime Rib and being served chopped liver instead.It starts with a make out session with scantily clad drunken teens on a beach. Then Anna (Sumi in the Korean masterpiece) gets up and leaves her make out partner on the beach and runs into the woods and sees a garbage bag filled with dolls. One comes alive and looks like Linda Blair in The Exorcist. Then she goes to a beach house where she sees her mother, who looks to be about 75 years old, with an IV in her arm, and she is trying to cry out for help. So Anna runs up to the main mansion (why does the Father live in a mansion while his sick wife is relegated to a beach house? STUPID!) Eventually the mother is burned alive in the beach house!Then suddenly Anna is talking like a normal person to her psychologist in the mental institution and calmly describing her \"dream\". WHAT???? In the Korean masterpiece Sumi (Anna) is so psychologically damaged (schizophrenic, multiple personality) she cannot even speak! Then the Father picks Anna (Sumi) up from the mental institution and they are all happy and smiling, without a care in the world. They get to the mansion and Anna (Sumi) runs to her room , calling her sister. Sis is nowhere to be found, so she goes downstairs again and has a happy conversation with the stepmother. In the Korean masterpiece Sumi hates the step mom! In The Uninvited Anna hugs the step mom!!! Didn't this director and producer watch the Korean masterpiece AT ALL? Did they arrogantly think they could improve it? What a joke!Then the killer of all: Alex (Su-yeon in the Korean version) is at least a foot taller than Anna (Sumi!). Alex (Su-yeon) is supposed to be the YOUNGER sister!. Alex (dressed in a bikini!!) asks Anna (Sumi) why she never responded to her letters while she was in the mental institution. Anna (Sumi) says she never got them. So Alex (Su-yeon) starts screaming and cursing, blaming the father! She even uses the word A-hole! (great sympathetic role model for teens that you've got there, Dreamworks. Did you REALLY have to hire such vapid actors that have more in common with a Disney Channel sitcom?).I'll spare you anymore. Just watch the brilliant Korean film A Tale Of Two Sisters and throw the American piece of garbage The Uninvited in the dung heap of forgotten film bombs, where it belongs.'\n",

One of them is, to make the cast more teeny friendly. Which also had impact on the story/pace and scares of the movie. It's not really complex, but rather a simple tale. Apart from the end that is. But even that was better in the Original, because it did match the mood in the Korean version. Whereas in the American version, it almost feels too clever for it's own good and doesn't match the teeny feel the movie tries to achieve throughout.

The more they learn about Rachel the more concerned they become.I thought this was a solid chiller. There isn't too much in the way of death and gore but it makes up for that with a claustrophobic feel and a constant sense of danger. This is helped by the fact that for the most part the action stays in the house and its waterside grounds. Somewhat inevitably the film provides a twist but it still managed to really surprise me. The cast is impressive; most obviously Emily Browning who is convincing as the increasingly fearful Anna, and Elizabeth Banks who is suitably ambiguous as Rachel. Solid support comes from Arielle Kebbel, as Alex, and David Strathairn, who plays the girls' father. The lack of real violence, strong language and sex/nudity means this might be suitable for younger viewers than many horror films; that said it might be a bit scary for some.

This movie reminds me of The Haunting for some reason it all isn't scary popping up stuff it could get really funny.I think a lot of people should watch this movie it's suspenseful,funny,and AMAZING!

            "Review: '\"The Uninvited\" qualifies as creepy, spooky stuff that never gets hardcore, but boasts good performances and a fourth quarter rug pull of a twist straight out of \"Fight Club.\" Elizabeth Banks of \"W\" is gorgeous as Rachel,the younger woman/stepmother, who moves in with writer Steven (David Strathairn) whose wife is dying. The film opens with the young heroine, Anna (Emily Browning) in a mental asylum where she has been placed for slashing her wrists. It seems that her mom died during a tragic house fire and Anna believes that the young stepmother set the blaze so that she could get into her father's bed and heart. The heroine along with her older sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) set out to expose the stepmother as the murderer. Anna is haunted by the appearance of two little boys and a little girl that randomly show up and freak her out. Initially, this all resembles \"The Sixth Sense,\" but this movie is nowhere near as effective as \"The Sixth Sense.\" \"The Uninvited\" is more manipulative than it is anything else.'\n",

            "Review: 'I have not seen A Tale Of Two Sisters, so I can't draw comparisons between the two, just yet. The Uninvited definitely had the potential to be one of the better horror remakes, but it's too half-baked to really work. Some twist endings really ruin a movie for me, yet on the other hand, some of them end up working out really well. The uninvited is not one of those times. I have seen this type of twist much too often, in better Horror films, mind you. The Performances often carry this rather mediocre film. Emily Browning made for an excellent lead in Anna. And Elizabeth Banks is a revelation in her creepy role. The main problem with The uninvited though, is there is no thrills or suspense to be found, other than a couple of decent boo scares. It's never boring, and often kept my interest, but when I watch a Horror film, I need to be scared, and The Uninvited failed to do just that. The Uninvited had so much potential with its clever premise. Unfortunately, The Uninvited failed to capture my imagination for the most part ,and remains a failure, but an interesting one.Performances. Emily Browning is excellent as Anna. She makes a likable heroine, giving us someone to root for. Sadly the twist ending, ruins any of that. Arielle Kebbel is a bit unlikable at 1st as Alex, but she ended up giving a great show, and her chemistry with Emily was endearing and natural. Elizabeth Banks proves once more, why she is one of Hollywood's best up and coming actresses. Her incredible beauty is very deceptive in this film, and what you see from her is pretty horrifying. David Strathairn is solid as a rock as the Father. Too bad he didn't have enough screen time, to matter for me.Bottom Line. The Uninvited certainly didn't bore me, and made for an effortless watch, but it's too routine and disappointing to have any long-lasting value, after you finish watching it. Worth a watch on cable, or a rental on DVD. Now it's on to a Tale Of Two Sisters, I'll see if the original does it better. 5 1/2 10'\n",

            "Review: 'The Uninvited (2009) is a movie that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a traumatized young lady who returns home from a psychological institution for the first time since her mom dramatically died and her dad remarried. She returns home to a hostile relationship with her stepmother, run ins with the ghost of her mom and a sister that just doesn't give an damn. Things get worse as more and more ghosts from her past return.This movie is codirected by Charles and Thomas Guard, who also codirected Round about Five, and stars Emily Browning (Sucker Punch), Arielle Kebbel (Grudge 2), Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games), David Strathairn (The Firm) and Jesse Moss (Tucker and Dale vs Evil).This is one of those movies where you wanted a little more from it. The cast is really good and everyone delivers a solid performance. The ladies in the cast are gorgeous. The plot has some good twists and turns. The end is clever and was pretty smart. My only complaint is the horror elements are limited and the jump scares were cheesy.Overall, with a story this good if they could have ratcheted up the horror elements this could have been a gem. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.'\n",

            "Review: 'This remake of the Korean \"Tale of Two Sisters\" is utterly awful. I don't know why, but it's been getting some good buzz and positive reviews. It deserves nothing but condemnation. It's a big mess. The so-called \"twist\" is stolen from \"The Sixth Sense\", so why the raves about that? In all seriousness, I only enjoyed watching the film when the female leads were wearing short dresses. I stared at their shapely legs while combating cliché fatigue. The film is also a remake of \"The Stepfather\" a very good film, except the stepfather here is a stepmother. Australian actress Emily Browning is sexy and vulnerable, a little like Juliet Lewis once was; her performance even reminded me of Lewis's work in \"Cape Fear\" and \"Natural Born Killers\". David Strathairn, who is usually very good, plays a totally one-dimensional character here who is required by the script to act irrationally and unrealistically.'\n",

            "Review: 'I saw this movie BEFORE the original Korean horror film ('A Tale of Two Sisters' ) that it was based on and I found this a bland, blunter, popcorn shocker version of the film.The sole merit of this film is Emily Browning. She turns in a credible performance. You believe in her, makes you fear for her, and that's half the battle. So it's such a shame that the directors and screenwriters drop the ball so badly. Everything in this movie is SO geared to a major twist in the last reel that instead of making you bug out with its rug-pulling impact, like Sixth Sense or Usual Suspects do, it instead just makes you roll your eyes. Why? Because like those 2 films i've mentioned this flick lacks of any preceding foreshadowing or character nuance thus robbing the end twist of its intended impact. Oh, and the cheesy J Horror ghosts moments seem more Scary Movie than The Ring.The Korean original was creepier, confusing in parts but it comes together in the end and the cinematography is beautifully framed (one impressive shot comes out from underwater and up onto a deck where the titular sisters are sitting). The Guard Brothers ignore such artistry and go for a generic approach and when they do breakaway its to copy/homage a Kubrick helicopter shot from 'The Shining'.Strathairn (fantastic in Good Night + Good Luck) is wasted. Banks, who has proved her on screen versatility in an eclectic choice of roles in multiple pics over the past year, here goes for the fairy tale Step mother - the steel under her smile was borderline hammy but she definitely is one of the best (and overlooked) actresses in the business.All in all - avoid this film and seek out the Korean original instead but if it turns up on cable and you have 87 minutes to waste - watch it for Browning and Banks and the fun of yawning at a schlock-y story.

            "Review: 'Americanized \"dumbed down\" version of A TALE OF TWO SISTERS concerns a recently released young woman, Anna, from an institution, who was traumatized by the house fire which killed her sickly mother. Returning home, she finds that pops has began a relationship with her dead mother's nurse, Rachel. Along with sister, Alex, Anna soon questions whether or not the nanny perhaps was behind the house fire in the goal of securing her father's love. Unable to convince her father of Rachel's possible murder of mama, Anna will attempt, along with Alex, to implicate her by pursuing her mysterious past. Meanwhile, Anna has visions of ghost children warning her of potential danger, and her mother pointing out Rachel as her murderer. When daddy drives to New York to meet with his publisher, the sisters can once and for all settle their differences with Rachel.This has the framework of those \"evil stepmother\"/\"the other woman\" movies where siblings set out to take down the maternal monster that has the adults and citizenry around her fooled. Pucker-lipped Emily Browning gets the lead role as Anna, the \"innocent\" who is \"seeing dead people\" and faces an uphill battle to prove her accusations regarding the demonic nurse wishing to take away daddy all to herself. The key to this film is understanding that practically everything seen is through the eyes and perspective of Anna. The film always questions Anna's sanity..I mean she does see unnatural beings, we are never quite sure, until the end, whether or not she's delusional or correct regarding Rachel's guilt or innocence. Arielle Kebbel is the \"party girl\" sister, pretty much in a teeny bikini throughout the movie, and has quite an attitude. Alex is a direct polar opposite of Anna, an aggressive, vocal young woman, but the way her character is addressed throughout the movie should be given great attention. Elizabeth Banks is great in a juicy role as Rachel. She has a chance to stir the tension, going in and out of bitch psycho mode with ease. David Strathaim has a small part as the father who wishes for Anna to embrace Rachel, as he obviously has a special fondness for her. The sordid aspect is the fact that papa and Rachel were having an affair while mom was slowly dying.I think this film will suitably work for those who haven't seen TALE OF TWO SISTERS, but for us who have, this doesn't leave a lasting impact, although I did admire the touch regarding a killer named Mildred Kemp...it was a nice little disturbing wink to the viewer. A problem I had was with the ghouls, the lighting is too dark to truly appreciate them, but when you get a chance to see them, they are very computer generated..this might not bother some fans who will probably find them genuinely frightening. Except for the supernatural bend and the twist, this is a Lifetime movie.'\n",

One day the boathouse blows up with Mom inside. All this is told in flashbacks after the opening scene of Anna getting out of the asylum where she's been undergoing therapy for shock, guilt, horrible nightmares, and sounds of little bells.She returns home and tries to pick up the pieces of her life, but Mom's old LPN (Elizabeth Banks) has taken up with Dad (David Strathairn) in her absence, and Anna and older sister Alex are resentful. Then Mom starts appearing again, suggesting that there was more to her death than met the eye.Mercifully few gotcha scenes, some decent acting, and a literate script help, but this film is a good example of a bad subgenre. It's like saying you've got the most neatly shoveled sidewalk on your block. Nice, I guess, but hard for anyone to really care.Periodic Rant about the Idiots at the MPAAThe Uninvited features grisly fright scenes of decomposing corpses and decapitated bodies, along with teenage girls, drenched in blood, wielding butcher knives. It was rated PG-13.It opened the same day as the revenge fantasy Taken, with its stabbings, garrotings, explosions, sex slavery, torture, gratuitous murders, manic car chases against traffic, and widespread splashes of blood. Also PG-13.But Frost/Nixon, a high-class production which is basically 2 guys having a political conversation in a living room, gets an R.Question: Can anyone explain this?Answer: No!

            "Review: 'The Uninvited is a remake of South Korean psychological horror drama A Tale of Two Sisters that is my favourite movie of all time. If you haven't watched that movie yet, do yourself a favour and treat yourself with the atmospheric, emotional, gloomy, mysterious and twisted original masterpiece. As for The Uninvited, the Hollywood remake only remade a few key elements of the original film and changed numerous parts of the story as well as one major twist. If compared to the original movie, The Univited doesn't come close to its brilliance but if you see it as a stand-alone film, you will enjoy this movie quite a lot.Shot in beautiful British Columbia, The Uninvited tells the story of mentally unstable Anna who had lost her terminally ill mother in a terrible fire ten months ago. After a suicide attempt, she had spent some time in a psychological institution and is now discharged. She returns home but realizes that her father is strangely passive and focuses on writing his next novel to escape reality. Anna however spends some quality time with her older adventurous sister and slowly starts appreciating life again. The two sisters though don't get along with their father's new girlfriend who once was their mother's nurse. Since the nurse starts acting suspiciously, the sisters try to find out more about her and realize that she changed her name for mysterious reasons and seems to hide a shady past. As if that weren't enough, they soon find hints that their mother didn't die by accident but might have been killed by the selfish nurse. When an important witness of the tragedy dies under mysterious circumstances, the two sisters realize that their father's girlfriend has found out about their investigations. They plan on avenging their dead mother before the nurse incapacitates them.The movie convinces on numerous levels. The locations in British Columbia look splendid and especially the family mansion and its immediate surroundings are absolutely gorgeous. The twisted story is very detailed and comes around with one major jaw-dropping twist that will certainly stay on your mind. The acting performances are overall solid and especially lead actress Emily Browning convinces as tormented, fragile and confused teenage girl. The movie was directed with precision and care by two expert directors who deserve more recognition than they have got. The soundtrack underlines the uneasy atmosphere perfectly throughout the movie.In the end, The Uninvited is a gripping psychological drama that doesn't overstay its welcome and convinces with great acting performances, precise directing, stunning locations, detailed plot and intense soundtrack. Make sure to watch the groundbreaking original film A Tale of Two Sisters before enjoying the very good but not excellent remake. If you really like the story, make sure to check out the haunting Korean folk tale The Story of Janghwa and Hongryeon that inspired both movies.'\n",

That's right It's Scooby Doo and i only wished \" The Uninvited\" was half as interesting as an episode with Scooby , Shaggy and the gang. The Uninvited tells the story of a young girl named Anna , who was admitted into a mental hospital following the death of her biological mother. Returning home some time later, Anna is shocked to discover that her father has recently gotten engaged to Rachel , her mother's former nurse. Anna's suspicions about Rachel are soon confirmed when her mother reaches out from the beyond to deliver a stark warning, prompting the young girl and her sister to try and persuade their father that Rachel is not who she appears to be. As the situation in the once-peaceful household rapidly begins to deteriorate, Rachel's true colors finally begin boiling to the surface. It's not easy to make a Horror movie in America these days. The critics ( including me ) will hate it by definition: their expectations are always high and mostly unsatisfiable but the studios only have themselves to blame because of their complete lack of originality. This is yet another Asian remake of a film originally called \" A tale and two sister\" a film , and i am told that has its fare share of scares. This has none. None whatsoever. I was so bored with this film i was beginning to wonder why this is labelled as a horror film at all . Although it's only 87 minutes long it felt like three hours . It's not until the big twist comes ten minutes from the end that it finally becomes a little bit interesting but it's far to late to save this film and to be honest , the twist is just a \" Sixth Sense\" rip off . The acting is OK without being spectacular , and Emily Browning's pouting deserves a mention because it's absolutely Spectacular. Strait out of the Angelina Jolie book of \"how to pucker your lips for ninety minutes\". If you was thinking of watching \" The Uninvited \" i would say , Don't Bother . Get hold of the original if you can or just watch the trailer . It will save you a lot of time and boredom.To sum up \"The Uninvited \"in one word , i will leave it to my friends Shaggy and Scooby .

In the right hands, this disturbing material could have produced a classic, along the lines of Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" or the original, 1963, \"The Haunting.\" As it is, \"The Uninvited\" is mediocre, and not particularly scary. The entire cast is great; given the surprise ending, every actor has to deliver his/her line readings in a way that can be understood more than one way. The cast carries this off very well, with Elizabeth Banks doing an especially masterful job. The writing and direction are not up to the actors or the premise. The movie can't decide whether it wants to be a psychological thriller whose antagonist is a serial killer, or a horror movie whose antagonist is some unidentified supernatural force. The special effects are cheesy and not scary: corpses whose heads twist on their necks, animated kitchen scraps in plastic garbage bags. I would have liked to have seen more coherence. Am I supposed to be afraid of a serial killer or some unnamed supernatural force who seems to be visiting from another movie, and hiding out in this movie's trash?I really wanted this movie to be better once I discovered the surprise ending. So many big, heavy, deep, disturbing psycho-social issues are addressed, most of them focusing on women and girls. But there's just no artistic development, and very little apparent intelligence, in the handling of these themes.'\n",

            "Review: 'Movie is incredibly static. Scenes in which nearly nothing (or less) happens take minutes. Single shots of characters sitting in a tub talking or riding in a car talking or sitting in a diner talking drag severely, even when they aren't very long. The actors are bland and unemotive. The score is quite sparse, if sometimes solid. The effects are generally uninteresting. There is really nothing to recommend besides the main girl's upper lip which looks like it could support a decent mustache.Again, it's basically a very long string of inconsequential, undynamic dialogue scenes in different, consistently bland settings with a few mediocre horror scenes interspersed. As it progresses it also manages to incorporate competent montages that move the plot forward as well as some gratuitous overhead and insert shots.Has to be disappointing if you were expecting anything.'\n",

            "Review: 'So I was sitting alone in my flat and thought what the heck I'll go rent a horror movie. The uninvited, from the producers of the ring, had an interesting cover and proclaimed to have a nerve tickling story with a shocking ending. An impossible story with an ending that more or less tweaked my nose for watching the movie, would have been a more accurate description.What we get is a story where a girl (Anna) is released from some kind of asylum after having to deal with her mothers tragic death. She comes home to find that her dad's new girlfriend is her late mothers nurse (Rachael). In some kind of dreamlike state, Anna is confronted by her dead mother, who tells her that Rachael killed her, as if that would surprise anyone. Most of the rest of the movie then consists of Anna, with the help of her sister (who we later find out only exists in her head, although interacting perfectly with the rest of the family), trying to prove Rachaels guilt. It's nothing but a blurry string of scenes where it's hard to know whether Anna is hallucinating (which she does frequently) or if things are actually happening. \"Zapping\" sound effects are used, for instance when lights are turned on, to make the viewer jump in their seat, in a manor that sometimes makes them laughable. So this is actually not a creepy movie, it's more of a jumper. I jumped a few times, but not nearly as many as I imagine the creators wanted, and mostly because I was sitting in a dark room with the volume turned up.Even though this was one of the most predictable movies I've seen in a long time, I really wondered how they would tie this mess up in the end. Sadly enough, they didn't. The whole movie turns at the end in a way that might shock a 14year old schoolgirl getting straight F's hanging out with her friends too much. My personal reaction was more or less \"aw FFS\".So would I recommend this piece of youknowwhat? Maybe to viewers who fit the earlier given description, but that's about it. There is no way that anyone who watches a movie with a little sense of criticism, could get any amusement, except for the occasional sarcastic comment, from watching this. I can honestly say the only thing that caught my eye was the cute actress who played Anna, because I recognized her from some other movie but I couldn't remember which. Of course it was the little girl from Ghost Ship (thanks IMDb), which isn't a masterpiece either, but at least that story, in comparison to this mess, could be considered watertight...'\n",

            "Review: 'The Uninvited would be an apt title for any number of US remakes of foreign language films, and even 20 odd recent American horror films for that matter.Other proposals for you: - The Unnecessary - The Uninspired Ideas - The Underwhelming - The Uninteresting - The Unbelievably BadYet the hits keep coming, here we have a remake of the Korean movie \"A Tale Of Two Sisters\", which was an effective little chiller that I saw a few years back. So I was admittedly sceptical - but by no means surprised - when Hollywood in its infinite wisdom said they were remaking the film, but after months of bypassing it on the shelf the other night I thought \"why not?\".A few initial thoughts How did the Dad read the Anna's lips from 40m through a window? I couldn't read her lips and I was watching a close up of her face! - If \"something bad\" is in your room why would you turn your back to it deliberately? - It's refreshing to see actors playing adolescents who appear adolescent. - Is it still considered a spoiler if I say that the (re)makers didn't deviate much from the original? - What the hell did the poster have to do with the film? - I'm not angry at myself for watching it, but I'll hardly be recommending it on again to anyone. - This is not the worst remake I've seen, but that's as glowing an accolade as I can come up with.Now the review.It's worth mentioning again for some perspective: The original was made in Korea by Korean film-makers, this is a US made remake.The plot: Anna returns to the family home from the loony bin (mental hospital) after witnessing the death of her invalid mother in a massive fire that engulfed the \"granny flat\" that she lived in. Anna's mother required care from a live-in nanny, who since the incident has moved into the primary residence with Anna's father. The Dad is played by David Strathairn, who is good but has little to do but look troubled and confused, the nanny is Elizabeth Banks who has been in almost every MA rated comedy in the last couple of years and is usually quite likable in her films. Aussie Emily Browning plays Anna and her sister is played by the cool-ly named Arielle Kebbell.Shortly after returning home Anna is lead to believe that her Mother's death was no accident. The rest of the movie is concerned with her investigations into this. That's it for plot. The remake is well acted, pretty well made and looks good, it's just uninspired and seems to simply go through the motions. Most of the scares are derived from flashbacks and visions and usually have a payoff which is generally a cheap shock.There are so many visions in fact that I was reminded of \"The Simpsons\", the show that has no peer when it comes to hallucinations and dream sequences, (\"Flintstones chewable morphine\", \"Homer loves Mindy\", \"I call the big one Bitey\").One annoying throw in was the (supposedly clever) inclusion of a red-herring third party, and the closing sequences apparently wrap up the loophole. The fact is that the red herring makes no sense when you think about it, and unfortunately most of the visions that occur through the first hour of the film revolve around it, rendering them void. It is a bit of a middle finger to the audience when you go along with film-makers and then realise that none of it makes sense.As this is the US approximation of the original don't expect any slow build, or any long quiet sequences to build mood and set tone, this is loud bits and \"jump out of nowhere\" scares all the way. The climax is overdone, loud and blustery, there are parallels to another famous movie of the 90′s that I won't name for fear of giving plot points away (I'm not saying it's a rip but they don't bring anything new to the table).Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Turn your brain off and it's an OK slumber party flick, but that doesn't give an endorsement to those of us that aren't teenage girls! (This ain't your 40 Year Old Virgin Elizabeth Banks.)If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com'\n",

            "Review: 'Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \"inspired\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \"Stepmother\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.'\n",

            "Review: 'I had been waiting to see this film since it's trailer was played during my Saw V (October) viewing. I'm happy to say that it lived up to the hype. Unfortunately, much like when you go to a stand-up comedy act and you are forced to listen to hecklers, I had the misfortune of having a very obnoxious viewer two seats next to me. He would not be quiet, regardless of who in the audience -- and there was plenty of people -- told him so. I did stay in the theater but it was a difficult choice.The film starts off with Anna (Emily Browning) in a mental institute trying to cope with losing her mother. Her doctor advises her to leave, go home and recover with her family. When Anna goes home, she is not given a warm welcome by her sister, Alex (Arielle Kebbel). Her father (David Strathairn)'s new girlfriend, Rachael Summers (Elizabeth Banks) seems to be quite cheerful at Anna's homecoming.Anna, troubled by nightmares and some obvious uncomfortableness on her boyfriend, Matt (Jesse Moss)'s part, Rachael doesn't seem like the innocent, lovable mother she's trying to be. Anna's accusations are confirmed when she realizes Rachael's ID is phony. Alex and Anna try to tell their father, but he won't listen and even when he does, he doesn't believe their theories.Overall, the movie is more of mystery/suspense with some 'thriller' aspects to it, but it's nowhere near to being a 'horror' for me. While, I was sympathetic towards many of the characters, thanks to character development, there was no points where you feel like Alex and/or Anna are in any real danger.One aspect I like most about The Uninvited is the fact that the teens do not engage in sex, drugs, or alcohol but it still has the horror vibe type of movie. I was expecting the girls to have sex with someone and get killed, but sex only took place for the Rachael character.The sound effects are tremendous. I like the dark gritty feel of the film and I also think the thrills of the movie are what will drive chills up the spine to the viewers who flock to this film. I'm sure some female teens will scream, but for the most part this is a psychological thriller.I have, up till this point, left out the best part -- the twist! Oh yes, much like the 2 other \"horror\" films I've seen for 2009 -- My Bloody Valentine 3D and The Unborn -- The Uninvited boasts an unexpected twist that is more than shocking. Now that you know there's a twist, it won't do any good to \"search\" for it while watching, it's completely untraceable. And, if you try to search, you'll miss the actual movie that you should be trying to enjoy.I don't agree that it's worth a 14A (in Canada) but, I'm sure that anyone younger would have nightmares. If you are in the age bracket 14-25, I'm positive you will enjoy The Uninvited. I, personally, will be seeing it again -- perhaps multiple more times -- before it leaves the box office.'\n",

            "Review: 'In my bold and humble opinion, this is even better than The Ring (2002), another Asian horror film. And more, it's far better than the boring drab that was the original Korean film, A Tale of Two Sisters (2003), which was pretty much a confusing yawn-fest \"artsie-fartsie\" that went nowhere. All the flaws and wrongs in that film were corrected and improved here.The reviews were mixed, which is unsurprising as people have had enough of Asian horror remakes by the late 2000s. But they prejudged the film too quickly. It was surprisingly good. Very gripping from the start to the end. It didn't become overlong and was nicely paced, flowing film with a fresh and satisfying twist ending that no one would see coming. I'll give you a hint. There are two plot twists. One may be unsurprising and perhaps even \"obvious\" as it is hinted throughout the film, but the other is relatively shocking.I enjoyed the film thorough and thorough. It didn't take itself very seriously and go any deeper like the terrible original film. The theme music by Christopher Young was beautiful, which I believe was Anna's theme. Unlike the original film, which had the tedious Korean soap opera style of music.Now to the cons. Actually, it's just one conspicuous con. I know the film wanted to be true to the original by including supernatural elements such as visions of scary ghosts (or whatever they were). I believe they were irrelevant to this film's story. The film should've played out like a normal psychological mystery thriller without any cheesy ghosts - Though I do grant the film that the ghosts were kept in minimal here, unlike the original, which was pretty much filled with them.If The Uninvited was carried out as a \"realistic\" psychological thriller I would've given it a higher rating for sure. But still, this isn't a major and completely dreadful flaw. The film was still very enjoyable and riveting either way.'\n",

            "Review: 'Not to be confused with the 1949 Ray Milland ghost movie, the Guard Brothers' 2009 offering, \"The Uninvited,\" tells a spooky tale of a wholly different kind. In this ingenious little film, the viewer makes the acquaintance of Anna Ivers, a young woman who has just been released from a 10-month stay at a sanatorium following her mother's accidental death. She returns to her dad's home on the Maine coast, and is soon appalled to learn that her father has decided to marry the pretty nurse who had been her mother's caretaker. But Anna and her sister Alex soon have even more cause to be alarmed, when the ghost of their mom appears to make some dire accusations! Culminating with a twist ending as startling as the ones in \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"The Other,\" this film really did catch this viewer off Guard. It is fascinating to watch this picture a second time, and to note with what consummate skill the filmmakers have played fair with their game. Besides this wonderful surprise, \"The Uninvited\" offers up some very accomplished acting by its four leads (Emily Browning as Anna, Arielle Kebbel as her sister, Elizabeth Banks as the prospective stepmother from hell, and David Strathairn as the seemingly oblivious dad) and some gorgeous location shooting, with Bowen Island (north of Vancouver) standing in for the Maine locale. Kudos also to Christopher Young, for his memorably eerie score. But it is young Miss Browning who steals this picture. Appearing in every single scene in the film, Emily does flawlessly well in her difficult role. Possessing as perfect a face as can be imagined, almost like that of a young Merle Oberon (\"You have beautifully shaped lips,\" she is told in the film, and ain't it ever the truth!), this lovely actress' achievement here will be even more appreciated with that previously mentioned repeat viewing. I foresee a very bright future for this young lady...unlike the grim one that I can only envision for poor Anna!'\n",

            "Review: 'So, it seems to me that the beginning of this year is off to a Horror Movie edge. With previews coming out of one horror movie after the other, people are pretty much expecting them to be good. For instance the preview of The Unborn. I expected that to be decent when I saw the preview, and of course the movie flopped big time, however when I saw the preview for The Uninvited I expected it to be a flop. ~SPOILERS~Much to my dismay however The Unborn delivered what it had to. It centers around Anna, who in the beginning is let out of her psych unit to go back home after her attempted suicide after her mothers death in the tragic fire in the boat house. She gets greeted by her dad and when home is reunited with her sister Alex, and the not so welcome Rachel Summers. It is clear throughout the movie that the sisters believe that Rachel must have killed their mother but throughout the movie you are waiting to find out that one piece of evidence they need to prove their point and not seem crazy, but Rachel has already convinced Anna's dad she should go back to the Psych ward.The movie provides intense moments, and, in true horror movie fashion, the cheap scare to get you to jump, but it doesn't detract from the story. Emily Browning (ANNA) is a character that you can sympathize with and feel sorry for, wanting her to be able to prove her point, but in the climax of the movie a climax like no other happens.I won't spoil it for anyone, but I have to say, I have never spent the last 10-15 minutes of a movie with my JAW TO THE FLOOR! It is quite honestly the most shocking twist ending to a movie I have ever seen. To those of you who saw The Others, and thought that was a twist ending... hahaha This beats that by over a hundred times.Go see The Uninvited. It is a well crafted Horror movie that accomplishes what it has to.'\n",

            "Review: 'I could not have asked for any more from this movie. It is the first movie of this genre in years to rival the quality of the Sixth Sense. Near the end, I was thinking, \"decent horror thriller\". There was none of the immature, morbidly indulgent sexuality so common in horrors these days, and the plot had panned out as well as could be expected. Then came the twist, which was eloquently crafted and incredibly surprising. Immediately, your mind pours over the film, looking to dissect the non-existent inconsistencies, and minutes later, you're just left thinking \"wow...\".Well written, directed, acted, and far better than the original - in every aspect. I think your perception of the two largely depends on the order that you see them; however, there is hardly a comparison. After reading some of the reviews saying that Tale of Two Sisters was even better, we couldn't wait to see it. What a disappointment! Yes, the original reconciles its inconsistencies in the end, which is usually the cheapest way to throw in a plot twist, in my opinion, but the twist is still ambiguous in nature, and, while a movie can obviously not be appreciated in its entirety the first time through, the main plot points should be feasibly obvious. The scenes in Tale of Two Sisters were poorly integrated, and the twist, again, poorly defined. Even after reading the full explanation, hoping to find some more redemption there, I found little reason to appreciate the movie in all of its over-hyped brilliance.To summarize, The Uninvited is an artful remake of its inadequately executed predecessor.'\n",

(My summary is also the very first line of the film.) A young girl begins to suspect that the woman who nursed her mother while she was dying is a psychopath and wants to kill people, including her and her sister, to get to her father.What we get is a poorly constructed and somewhat confusing series of events that play out as if they were thrown together at the last moment to appeal to the teeny-bopper generation. It leaves so many questions unanswered and many plot points unrealistic and, at times, downright laughable.This films tries to be more clever than it actually is, so do yourself a favor: be clever, rent the original Korean film \"A Tale of Two Sisters.\" You'll get your money's worth, and you won't be treated like an idiot for an hour and a half.'\n",

            "Review: 'The South-Korean horror classic (yes, already) \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" was a bona fide masterpiece and, in my humble opinion, one of the ONLY Asian ghost-story deserving all the hype and praising reviews. So-called hits like \"Ringu\" and \"Ju-On the Grudge\" were actually just tame and infantile mainstream flicks, but \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" was the real thing with a genuinely haunting atmosphere, a strong story concept and unpredictable twists. An American remake was therefore inevitable, but somehow I felt quite confident about \"The Uninvited\" as soon as I heard it was in production. The Guard Brothers are reasonably unknown directors but the original screenplay is so strong that it is almost impossible to mess up. I'm as much anti-remake as the next guy, but \"The Uninvited\" is a respectful, occasionally atmospheric and stylishly shot mystery thriller with some excellent acting performances and a well-structured and logical scenario. This movie isn't nearly as psychologically challenging or disturbing as the South Korean original, but understandably this American version wanted to appeal to much larger and younger audiences. There are also several essential plot differences between this version and the original and the remake is noticeably a lot less convoluted. Now, the original admittedly was a little too complex but this version is kept so unmistakable and straightforward that everyone who missed some fragments can pick them up here. Anna returns home from the psychiatric clinic with her father, six months after the traumatizing boat house explosion in which her sick mother died. Anna is happy to be reunited with her older sister Alex, but both girls detest their father's new girlfriend Rachel. Anna begins to suffer from nightmares and hallucinations in which the ghost of her deceased mother seemingly tries to tell her something. The girls develop a theory that Rachel deliberately killed their mother in order to marry the father and even that she has done this before already, back in the 1990's when she had a different name and killed the three children of a family. \"The Uninvited\" is a PG-13 movie, so don't go expecting to see many scary images or unsettling murder sequences. The few special effects are very adequate, but it's mainly the breath-taking British Columbian filming locations that leave the biggest impression. Emily Browning and Arielle Kebbel are terrific as the two struggling teenage sisters and also Elizabeth Banks gives away a good performance even though her wicked stepmother character is ultimately stereotypical. David Stathairn is a brilliant actor as well, but he's extremely underused here.'\n",

There's no sound in the audience, just confusion from what supposed to be a scary moment was nothing more then a cheap ploy by the film maker to make people jump out of their seat(to which no one did).Another thing i found terrible was the predictability of the film.

The setting, just north of Vancouver, British Columbia is stunning. There are some compelling moments. But there are some parts of the plots that make no sense whatsoever.

One can forgive a bland script if no energy, talent, or expenditure is \"wasted\" for it, but one can't forgive the massive abuse of resources that we have here.Again, we see the result of \"hate\" critics from the sixties and seventies furthering the careers of poor writers and directors, which made for the obvious scenario of the hacks being the \"judges\" of the next batch of writers and directors, deliberately throwing out the more inspired writers first.

Elizabeth Browning is particularly appealing and easy on the eyes too. She makes the movie believable.This is an old-fashioned scary movie, the type that will appeal to adults more than teens. In fact, I would say that it's more of a Hitchcock-type suspense movie than a scary movie. It has a few scenes that are supposed to make you jump, but I wasn't fazed. Although some people die, their deaths aren't shown on screen. You do see some blood--on the floor and on clothes.***SPOILER*** As for the ending, it's a cheat. In my opinion, movie-makers have an implicit contract with the audience to the effect that most of what you are seeing on-screen is real. Every now and then, a movie breaks the contract, and the audience finds out at the end that everything they've been watching is either a dream or a hallucination. OK, I admit that once in a blue moon, this type of plot works. The Wizard of Oz is the classic example, but that movie worked because it makes no pretense of being anything other than a fantasy. Most of the time though, when the whole plot turns out to have been a dream or a hallucination, I feel cheated. This is nothing but a lazy plot device that allows screenwriters to put all sorts of weird, spooky, and fantastical scenes in a movie since they know they can explain it all away in the end.'\n",

Even the famous Chinese horror movie,The Eye, is remade with Jessica Alba. The Uninvited is the remake of Korean Tale of two sisters. It is basically not a bad movie. It has the tension like a thriller movie. This is not really a horror movie, it is more onto a thriller with a slight element of horror.The story: Anna played by Emily Browning returns home from a mental hospital. She sees changes at home. There is a evil stepmother and Anna experiences some weird visions and she, with her sister, must find out the truth of what are these strange visions she sees. That is the plot. There are the tension and suspense. They will hold you on the seat till the final twist of all. I was watching it, urging to see how it ends.Overall: It is not a bad thriller but it could have been better with the pace. It somehow is slow at some points. If you are a fan of remake, you should catch this out. Fans of the original should give it a watch, who knows, it may be a better remake than the recent remakes.

I have watched the movie once before, but only recalled the movie's title and it's cover. So naturally I opted to sit down and watch it again, as I had the opportunity to revisit it.Writers Craig Rosenberg, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard put together an enjoyable script and storyline for directors Charles Guard and Thomas Guard to bring to the screen. Now, I haven't watched \"Changhwa, Hongryon\" from writer Jee-Woon Kim, so I don't know how true \"The Uninvited\" is to the source material. I do like how the audience is kept in the dark as to what is going on, and when you just think you've got it all figured out, then the writers throw you a curve ball and puts you back in the dark.I was, for the majority of the actors and actresses in the movie, not familiar with the cast ensemble, aside from Emily Browning, Elizabeth Banks, Don S. Davis and Jesse Moss. I will say that the acting performances in the movie were good, and they brought the characters to life in very believable ways.If you enjoy an unpredictable thriller that throws you off and leaves you in the dark then \"The Uninvited\" is definitely well-worth sitting down and checking out.

            "Review: 'Anna Ivers returns home to her sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) after a stint in a mental hospital, though her recovery is jeopardized thanks to her cruel stepmother (Elizabeth Banks). Her dismay quickly turns to horror when she is visited by ghastly visions of her dead mother.I'm always hesitant to watch horror movies on Netflix, because they tend to be newer and lower budget (not that this is always a bad thing). This one is newer, but the budget is there, and they were able to get a few faces I recognize. Especially Arielle Kebbel and Elizabeth Banks, with a nice, smaller role by horror veteran Jesse Moss.Much of the film plays out sort of like a mystery. What is going on? Is it supernatural? Is the stepmother really who she claims to be? It's not the best suspense film, but it is more than adequate in holding your attention, especially thanks to strong performances. In a way, this film anticipates the widely celebrated \"Goodnight Mommy\".'\n",

            "Review: 'This movie is adapted from an Asian story and as often is the case doesn't translate easily to \"western\" sensibilities. Still, it was a mostly enjoyable 90 minutes. Mystery and horror but not too gruesome.Emily Browning is Anna, and the movie opens with what turns out to be a bad, recurring nightmare she has, involving her sick mother, and some body parts in plastic bags she finds in the woods. She is with a psychiatrist, and after their session he tells her she is ready to go home and resume her life. Which she does.She is reunited with her older sister. Arielle Kebbel as Alex. Both of them are disturbed by the budding relationship their day, David Strathairn as Steven, with their deceased mother's former care-giver, Elizabeth Banks as Rachel Summers. We see Rachel as the prototypical younger woman who wants to get rid of the kids to have dad for herself.But what we see on screen is not necessarily what is really going on. In fact, what we see is mostly in Anna's imagination while something quite different is actually going on. We don't find out until the very end of the very last scene what is really going on.SPOILERS: DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE. As we view the movie we see that Anna's mother was killed in an accidental boathouse explosion. But what we eventually learn is that Anna caused the explosion, which had also killed her sister. She was only imagining that her sister was still there. She imagined that Rachel was an impostor, trying to get rid of her, and Anna actually kills off Rachel, and she ends up back in the psychiatric hospital.'\n",

            "Review: 'The appealing, cherubic Emily Browning (\"Ghost Ship\") plays Anna, a girl who's just gotten out of a mental institution. Her time there was triggered by the horrible death of her mother, who'd perished in a fire. Now Annas' father Steven (David Strathairn, \"Dolores Claiborne\") has hooked up with the mothers' nurse, a woman named Rachel (Elizabeth Banks, \"Slither\"). Anna reconnects with her wild-child sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel, \"The Grudge 2\"), and the two of them fear that they must act upon their suspicions that Rachel is a no-good type willing to murder people to get what she wants.An Americanization of the South Korean horror film \"A Tale of Two Sisters\", this proves to be watchable enough, thanks to a somber mood, decent atmosphere, some mildly creepy scenes, and sparing use of digital effects. The music score by Christopher Young (\"Hellraiser\") is excellent. The performances are effective right down the line, although the script makes the father a little too thick-headed and seemingly not overtly compassionate. It also telegraphs where it's headed (and its big reveal) too early in the game. It's too bad, because this story did have some potential. Overall, it steadily works its way towards an inevitably grim resolution. (This viewer will say that he did like the little twist right before the end credits.)Banks is fine playing the character about whom we're intended to have doubts. *Is* she or *isn't* she a murderess? Young Browning does most of the heavy lifting as a reasonably sympathetic individual. Viewers will also note supporting performances by such familiar faces as Don S. Davis (\"Needful Things\"), Jesse Moss (\"Tucker and Dale vs. Evil\"), and Alf Humphreys (the original \"My Bloody Valentine\").Despite its problems, I found that this made for acceptable (if ultimately forgettable) entertainment.Six out of 10.'\n",

I guess it does if it's passing on TV on a Friday night and you have nothing else to do because there are no World Cup games at this time.But don't expect much: the scare scenes are as obvious as is the script. The mystery can be easily solved at the very beginning and all you expect is to be wrong and that the film comes with a surprise which can outcome your expectations. But in the end, it just will do if you don't have this annoying habit of trying to guess the end (I gotta get rid of it!).Acting is not exactly a strong point either. The main character girl kind of saves the cast.If you enjoy movies like 6th sense, the Others, Identity and other good Psychic Thrillers, you may also have fun with this one.

Why did I even waste my time?On the surface, this is a handsome production with fine cinematography and good performances. The script is the fatal flaw. One giant hole in act two is only a hint of things to come.

Among the better qualities here is the fantastic atmosphere present, which makes this one far more chilling and suspense than expected not only in the film itself but inside a film of this rating. The opening revelation back-story of the journey through the woods, coming across the corpse in the trash-bag and being up in the house before the explosion makes for make for a solid opening along with the fine questioning afterward where it fills in on why its important, while what happens at the house is where this really gets going. Following up the hallucination in the outhouse is the stellar sequence in the living room seeing the ghost materialize from the floor in the middle of the absolutely dark, creepy room and then crawling over to her horrified in the corner while the dream she has about her boyfriend as her flashback to the diner scene with the creepy children before seeing him crawl through and change into the deformed being that mirrors his real- life condition. These fun scenes give this one a wholly fun and enjoyable build here to the engrossing mystery at the heart of the film, from their search into her name and the connection with her previous job using the online pictures and reports combined with the ghostly prompting from her visions at the funeral create a really strong sense here that goes hand-in-hand with the stellar twist at the end here for a really great story. Though the twist itself seems so obvious when looking back on the scenes after the fact but comes off incredibly well and shocking here with the really startling manner it flashes back at the end with the encounter in the house being shown what really happened and how the girl got everything done in real life which gives this some nice bits of action as well as clearing up a lot of the other lame story lines. These here all make this one quite fun and enjoyable enough to help hold this up over the few minor flaws here. The biggest issue here is the film's rather decided lack of ghost action throughout the course here, as there's so few scenes here that it really tends to get overlooked here in this kind of story to the point of even wondering whey it was included. There's no importance placed on their appearance, there's no information gleamed from them and it doesn't really put them in a position to really put it's twist into motion by really offering all that much to suspect that. As well, the film's continual insistence on threatening her with the return to the asylum over whether she's insane or not is rather tiresome and repetitive and there's little about it that's appealing. Otherwise there's a lot to like here.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and a brief, mild sex scene.'\n",

Where I understand that aforementioned was ambiguous, this feels the need to spell everything out(once it reaches its conclusion, especially). It is also one of these recent horror flicks that are so clearly going to have a twist that they insist on trying to convince you it will be something else. I suppose that that, in itself, is not a negative, however, I've yet to see it be done in a manner that isn't extremely and noticeably awkward. There are lines and types of behavior in this that simply do not make sense until you see what they were the setup for. When it does reveal it all, it does, to an extent, improve the whole(other than an extremely easy out used), and not in that awful way where they hope it will so blow you away that you forget everything leading up to that point, and the quality of that. This is *clearly* padded(it could have been resolved in a much shorter space of time with not that great a loss to the overall impression it makes on the audience), and yet the running time is just short of 80 minutes. While I don't mind it as I myself belong in that group, could this possibly have fit in any more eye-candy for young males? It is literally nearly constant. This is rather creepy, and the mood is pretty good. There are only a few cheap jump scares, this seldom(not never) tries too hard and this doesn't have *that* much that doesn't pay off. The FX are great, and they are definitely not used excessively. This is well-acted all-round, and the casting is marvelous, particularly the lead, who was a *perfect* choice. As a drama and a mystery, this is reasonable. It certainly has moments. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality(no nudity) and infrequent strong language(all in all, about what they could put in without risking an R) in this. The DVD comes with an 18 minute informative featurette that spoils the movie, 5 and a half minutes of deleted scenes and a low-key alternate ending. I recommend this to fans of psychological thrillers. 7/10'\n",

            "Review: 'This is a really difficult one to comment on without at least hinting at major spoilers, but I'll do my best. Let me begin mb saying that if you were to file it under any of the headings horror movie, ghost story, and psychological thriller, you would not be wrong.Emily Browning plays Anna. At the start of the movie Anna is coming out of mental hospital: she has been there for 10 months following a suicide attempt after the death of her mother. We discover that mother, who was bed-bound, died in an explosion in the family's lakeside guest house - Anna has blocked most of this out, but has flashbacks of the explosion. Dad Steven (David Strathairn) takes Anna back home, to the luxurious main house, where she is greeted by Rachel (Elizabeth Banks), mother's nurse and now Dad's girlfriend, and older sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel). Alex is downright annoyed at Anna for leaving her in the midst of Rachel muscling in on Dad and ignoring her letters until Anna tells her that she never got any letters. The two sisters come to the conclusion that maybe their mother's death wasn't the straightforward accident they thought it was: this notion is enhanced by the fact that Anna has started having visions or dreams of her mother and three children, all of whom lay the blame for their deaths at Rachel's door, although she does not tell Alex about this. Rachel, by the way, is one of those people who always seems to be just out of sight but within earshot whenever the girls are talking about her. Anna's old boyfriend Matt says he saw what happened on the night of the explosion. The girls arrange to meet him that night but he doesn't show, following which Anna has a nightmare where he visits her, dead. The next morning his body is found in the lake. The girls start zeroing in on Rachel, and find old newspaper reports on the internet which indicate that she has done this before - targeted a grieving father then murdered the children. Anna challenges her over her false identity and Rachel threatens to have her returned to mental hospital. Finally the girls spot evidence - a newspaper photograph of the previous family shows the mother wearing the pearl necklace which Rachel now has. In a bungled attempt to grab the necklace while Dad is away overnight, Alex is injected with sedative but Anna manages to take the necklace to the sheriff, only for him to bring Rachel to the police station where she injects Anna with sedative, and takes her back to the house. As Rachel bends over her with a carving knife, the last thing she sees before she blacks out is Alex stumbling into the room. When she wakes, there is a trail of blood leading from the hall, through the house, to the dumpster outside....There is much here which is familiar. The ghost visitations / dreams / visions echo back to many other films. The cuckoo-like family invader is a stock character, though beautifully played here with silken malevolence by Banks. The gradual uncovering of the plot, and the downfall of Matt and so on are all building blocks in the story which are not in the least surprising, though still delivered satisfactorily. And there are a number of those moments that have you somewhat annoyed because you think the filmmakers should be able to avoid such clichéd triteness: Why is Dad so unreceptive to the girls' concerns? Can't he see what Rachel is up to? If Mum and the dead kids are trying to deliver messages to Anna, why do they do it by scaring the bejeebers out of her? Couldn't they just, er, deliver a message? Why don't the girls take more care to make sure that Rachel is out of earshot before making plans? Why on earth did they think that the best way of getting the necklace was for Alex to clamber round from window to window? Didn't they realise that it was foredoomed to failure when something more straightforward would work better? Why didn't they both go to the authorities as soon as they had their suspicions confirmed via the internet? Why did the sheriff betray Anna? Yes, it was a plot development which kept tension high, but didn't he at least have an obligation to check out her concerns? I was irritated by all these points as they popped up during the film. By the end of the movie I was satisfied over all of them. There was only one point which did leave me pondering, and that was the question of why the family thought it was a good idea to set up paralysed mother in the boathouse, a considerable distance from the main house, with a bell tied to her finger to get attention. It would have been easy to come up with an explanation, but it was never addressed. Oh well.I was pleased with the ending, and it made what might otherwise have been a routine offering into something rather better. There is an ever-increasing sense of paranoia, the performances are all good, there are creepy and made-you-jump moments, heightening tension throughout, and a lovely location for the house - the film looks attractive.'\n",

            "Review: 'The Uninvited is a movie which forces the question on why studios continue to make movies that are unoriginal and often clichéd. Not a bad movie compared to others, The Uninvited is still a movie that has taken tired old plots and simply sells them once more to those who enjoy movies.Anna (Emily Browning) is a troubled girl. The death of her mother almost a year earlier caused a suicide attempt which forced Anna into a mental hospital. She left behind her father Steven (David Strathairn) sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) and Rachel (Elizabeth Banks) who served her dying mother as a caretaker. Life is otherwise as it was when Anna left except with one difference that cannot be overlooked. Rachel has gone from being a nurse for the family and is now Steven's new girlfriend.Of course, Alex and Anna are not too excited about this and begin to see that something is wrong Rachel. Her behavior leads them to believe that Rachel may not be who she claims to be. Alex also begins to see visions of \"spirits\" that seem to point to Rachel as being not only a seducer but also the one responsible for her mother's death as well as the death of three children years earlier. While Steven ignores their pleas for help, Rachel is seen as controlling and willing to do anything to stay in Steven's life even if it means destroying the lives of Alex and Anna. The death of Anna's friend Matt (Jesse Moss) points to Rachel as being capable of anything to keep her secret safe.In the end we discover what the truth really is. Anna's mother was killed not by Rachel but by Anna. Matt himself was killed by Anna after he attempted to explain her actions the night of the fire. Also, Alex is dead and has been for almost a year after she was killed in the same fire that Anna started. Who Anna was speaking to was a sub conscious twisted by paranoia and guilt. However, Anna discovers this too late and Rachel's own life is ended by her hand.The problem with The Uninvited is that we have seen this before. Supposed spirits haunting characters, parents who don't understand, cheap attempts at suspense by using darkness and sounds, mystery surrounding the history of one character who could be evil or not, etc. Anna's character is the only one with depth while everyone else, including Rachel, are almost flat. The twist does redeem the movie and it is easy to be surprised by the realization that Alex has been dead. The Uninvited isn't bad but its something we have seen before. 6/10'\n",

This film revolves around a young woman who returns home after a season in a psychiatric clinic, motivated by the early and unexpected death of her mother. At home, however, she finds her sister and her father living with another woman, who was once their mother's nurse. From here develops a thriller and a family drama where the human psyche is linked magisterial to the supernatural.The script is very good, full of twists that enrich and heighten the drama, grabbing the public until the end, absolutely unexpected, despite the subliminal messages that have prepared it since the beginning, and the public ignored. The cast is headed by David Strathairn, the father, Emily Browning, the young Anna, Arielle Kebbel, the eldest daughter, Alex, and Elizabeth Banks, the other woman. Browning is flawless in her role, a complex and disturbed character who shows itself to be suggestible and gives some signs of a strong Oedipus complex. In fact, this young actress almost managed to monopolize the film. The filming mostly takes place in a secluded house, beautiful, on the seashore, and its isolation not only makes the place almost paradisiacal but also accentuates the feeling of solitude and vulnerability that sometimes feels.In short, this light-hearted horror thriller is probably one of the most stylish and well-built I've seen lately. He plays poker with the public, hides the game until the end and manages to escape from the clichés, play with them, surprise us and frighten us without resorting to the usual recipes of CGI, gore, shocking images etc.'\n",

            "Review: 'Ultimately my expectations for The Uninvited were mediocre. It looked interesting, part ghost story, part thriller but I assumed it would be rather run of the mill, typical in most ways which would make it entertaining but not spectacular. In many ways I couldn't have been more wrong because the film actually is a step above the typical teen thriller types like Disturbia or something of the like. The Uninvited is actually very smart, well written, well acted and will keep you glued to the story from beginning to end. Yes in some ways it is predictable but the clever blend of the supernatural with a mystery thriller makes it different enough to stand out amongst similar titles. The film has a dark foreboding look to it and the main characters former mental issues give the concept a bit of a plot twist as well as she struggles to make her loved ones believe. One of the things that perhaps made it a step or two above the rest of films like this in the genre is that the cast all really seem to give it their all. No one acts like this is a bad movie and everyone gives performance you can actually follow and enjoy. And unlike many films out there the twist at the end truly does leave you hanging and will shock you.Quirky and strong young actress Emily Browning headlines the cast as emotionally disturbed Anna. Browning gives a terrific and solid performance. Having best been known probably for her role in Lemony Snicket (at least to me) this is a great role for her that could bring her more into the adult world of acting. She carries the film flawlessly and shows real strength. Arielle Kebbel plays Browning's stubborn sister. Kebbel is a nice balance to Browning's character and the two of them truly have a sister like chemistry. Watching them unravel the mystery is fun and easy and intense at the same time. Both these girls have promising careers ahead of them I am sure of it and while this film doesn't prove that, it doesn't hurt it either. One of my all time favorite character actors, Oscar nominated David Strathairn plays their father. He is terrific as always. He has a certain intensity and believability to every role he plays. His chemistry with the cast is perfect and he just has a class to himself as a character actor. Elizabeth Banks is the new girlfriend and former Nurse to their mother. As it turns out Banks has the perfect face to play a psycho. That proves some versatility but certainly she quickly becomes the villain and has incredibly chemistry with Browning that makes the pace of the film just perfect.The Guard brothers are relatively new to the big screen. Clearly they were able to put together a terrific cast and direct them to a solid story. Perhaps its just that The Uninvited exceeded meager expectations but regardless the story and the characters are interesting and its easily worth seeing for anyone who enjoys mystery, thriller, horror, with a tough of drama. If you just want something very entertaining and fun to watch and most importantly it leaves you satisfied. So many of this type of film can leave gaping plot holes, and have an ending that leaves you confused or really disappointed but even the twist at the end, while its not a mind blowing shock, it still works really well. I think anyone watching The Uninvited will be truly pleasantly surprised. Well worth checking out! 8.5/10'\n",

            "Review: '\"The Uninvited\" is a remake of the Korean horror film \"A Tale of Two Sisters,\" which I have seen. Fortunately, my memory is not the best when it comes to recalling specifics about films I've seen, so I can't compare this movie too closely to the original. Let me just say that: Obviously, you should watch \"Tale of Two Sisters\" over this. It looks nicer, the acting is better, the story is more unpredictable, the pacing is more fitting. All of these are areas in which \"The Uninvited\" does not particularly stand out, at least in a good way, and this failure is heightened if you compare it to the original.If you're done watching the Korean version, though, there are a couple things about \"The Uninvited\" that may surprise you. The story is not a point-by-point retelling of the original. This shows that there were at least some ambitions behind the movie beyond just making money out of Americans' unwillingness to read subtitles, and that is to be appreciated.Most other attempts, though, to make the movie into anything more than a throwaway teen mystery thriller are in vain, sadly. The runtime of this movie is 87 minutes, which is a good length for a slasher flick but not for a movie like this. There is a severe lack of scenes that show the characters interacting in a natural way, as pretty much all of the scenes see our main character investigating the true motives of her creepy step-mother. Giving her more time with her father, or her sister, in the beginning of the film could have gone a long way in making me care for their relationships.Instead, the movie wastes time with stupid nightmare scenes. Maybe the producers thought they need scenes like that in a horror film, but they have absolutely zero tension or suspense, because we KNOW that they are only nightmares and our heroine will wake up screaming and then the movie will go on as before. If these scenes were only visually interesting or inventive, there might have been some value to them, but most of the time you're just staring at a mostly-black screen and listening to ambient noise and jumpscare music. It's boring. The narrative sense behind the nightmares, of course, is to show that Emily Browning's character is traumatized. As if the rest of her scenes didn't make that obvious already ...The acting is mostly fine, though Elizabeth Banks is not scary and Arielle Kebbel's character is annoying. If the movie had more depth, I might be able to tell you more about the acting or the characters, but they're all little more than archetypes.As for the visual side, there is one very clever shot in the film that is a very smart example of foreshadowing (and, as such, telling you what it is might count as a spoiler so I'm not gonna do it). During the other 86 minutes, \"The Uninvited\" looks like every other American horror movie from the 2000s.Also, on of the twists is quite predictable. I've seen the original, so that criticism might be unfair, but in the 2003 movie, the way the movie was written, directed, and acted made the reveal less predictable, whereas in this one I might have seen it coming even if I hadn't seen the Korean version before.I appreciated that the movie has a slightly different story from its original, but they do so little with it that I can't recommend this remake to anyone.'\n",

It's got some great actors in it, and a great story. Maybe the cinematography and directing are a little weak. It's not a masterpiece. But it is a great film. It has a lot of build up and suspense, and finally has some huge plot twists at the very end that you never see coming. I'm talking like almost at the level of \"the Sixth Sense\" and \"The Others\". So I highly recommend this movie, its a super enjoyable film if you are looking for something dark and suspenseful and scary with a murder mystery element, and an intelligent psychological plot and story line with a good progression and climax and epicly twisting ending, then this movie should be right up your alley.'\n",

It's jarring to say the least and obnoxiously inelegant at worst.I don't want to give spoiler review but I will say there is an attempt at a twist and I'm not saying I saw it coming but it is the most unoriginal way to have a twist.

Meanwhile, Dad has a hot girlfriend and apparently Rachel was taking care of Mom.This appeared to be the typical evil stepmom movie: girls hate the new stepmom and want to get rid of her.Prior to one particular event Rachel seems so nice, but in a creepy way. Elizabeth Banks (who of course LOOKS amazing) does a great job because every line could be either a genuinely nice person who feels insecure or a creepy person plotting to take what she wants and get rid of whoever or whatever is standing in the way. After the event every line definitely sounds like a woman plotting against the girls, except it could be disappointment about not being accepted by Anna, which she desperately wants.I'm not a fan of horror movies but this one had the added bonus of being an ordinary \"kids hate the evil stepmother\" film, with scary hallucinations. Yes, I read some reviews that said it's not scary, but this is not the sort of thing that appeals to me. I enjoyed the scenes with the sisters. Overall, the scenes that weren't scary or violent were entertaining, and the mystery was interesting. And we got to laugh a few times.At last we find out what happened. It's a pretty terrible scene in the sense of what it would be like if it really happened, but well done for a horror movie. Oh, no. All this time I had assumed there was one of two possibilities. Yes, at least one review said it would be easy to figure out when it happened, but not for me. Now we have a third and very chilling third possibility.But that didn't last. There was a fourth possible scenario, resulting in an absolutely horrifying conclusion. And the gaps from the beginning are filled in, of course. No happy ending here, but ... satisfying in a way. Some people would like it. Actually, the very last scene suggests something even worse than what I believe was true. Something horror fans might actually like, but it's terrible anyway.Emily Browning is quite good, though not as pretty as her sister. This is one disturbed child. Most of the time, though, she seems close to normal.Arielle Kebbel looks great in a bikini. Also, she's quite good. Her best performance, I suppose, comes when Alex is pretending to be a professional person investigating Rachel. She sounds so professional.It's a winning formula, and it did surprise me.'\n",

It's about a girl coming home from a psych ward after the death of her mother. She lives in a sprawling New England lake home with her sister, her father, and her father's new girlfriend. The daughters don't like the new love interest--they're pretty sure dad was involved with her before mom even died, even though she was the nurse hired to take care of her. The girl sees ghosts and believes that they are trying to tell her the new girlfriend had something to do with the mother's death. It ends with a twist that's not that memorable. I did have a problem with the way the girl moved as slowly as possible, just like every other character in every horror movie, whenever there was a noise she needed to examine. I thought this movie was at least smart enough to get around the clichés, but when I saw how they ended it, I realized they were never worried about being original.'\n",

            "Review: 'EDIT: March 19th, 2016. After watching this for the 3rd time, I've decided to edit this review in order to make it more accurate and objective.Like many excellent Horror films (especially Ghost Stories), The Uninvited is a remake of an Asian film (A Tale of Two Sisters). While I haven't yet seen the original, I can honestly say that this film is one of the best made Horror films I've seen. The main and best feature of this film is the plot twist towards the end, which is a shining example of what one should be like. I've always considered The Sixth Sense to have the best plot twist yet, but The Uninvited actually gives it a fight.The main plot is not that original, and tells the story of Anna (Emily Browning) coming home after 10 months in a mental institution, where she's been trying to cope with the trauma of losing her sick mother to a fire. Welcoming her home is her family - her beloved sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel), naughty and rebellious; her father (David Strathairn), a famous successful writer; her father's girlfriend Rachel (Elizabeth Banks) whose been with him since his wife's death; and even her old boyfriend Matt (Jesse Moss), who seems to be holding critical information about the night of the fire. The acting by all the cast is excellent, the characters are smartly made and serve the plot just the way they should.You know how sometimes you have a meal at a restaurant, and the desert is simply the best one you've ever had? Years later you might not remember what you had as an appetizer, you'll just remember what a great meal it was because of the divine desert. That's my opinion of The Uninvited. The ending is surprising, smart and simply superb. I believe the directors and screenwriters have taken the plot (and twist) from the original film, so credit is due there. Still, I can't stress enough how the end and twist catch you off guard, even if you're an experienced Horror and Thriller spectator.Watching the film for the 3rd time reveals absolutely no plot holes, no screenplay errors, and no shortcomings. One of the best films you'll ever watch!'\n",

When she arrives home she finds her sister, Alex (Arielle Kebbel), ornery as ever and her father, David Strathairn, is now shacked up with her mother's former nurse, Rachel (Elizabeth Banks). There's something wrong, some memory of the night of her mother's death is trying to work its way out. Not only that but the death toll just rose by one. This is an okay flick that is saved by its ending.'\n",

Guy wanna talk about the night her mum died and he dies. Wow... shocking.And the ghosts or delusions or what ever it is telling the character that her mum was killed. So original... - sarcasm.Of course the daddy wont believe his daughter. Of course... why would 35 year old woman wouldn't wont to be with 60 year old guy? Thats preposterous ! Right ?!And finally the twist... oooo how original idea to spin it = Joke. So then the mastermind behind this movie shows us totally different story. I mean ENOUGH !

            "Review: 'The Uninvited met my expectations and worked as a solid but average horror thriller. The story was well adapted and succeeded to involve myself in the principal objective of the director what I don't give away here.Therefore it tries hard to create suspense but many scenes were too predictable that you see miles away coming the creepy performances what I have seen many times before. The dialogs and the atmosphere with the great house at the sea were well done too and it was visually very interesting.The end was for me a great a-ha effect and I have to say that The Uninvited can be affiliate to other serious works such as THE RING, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or THE SKELETON KEY.Another great plus is the short running time of 84 minutes that helped me and my wife to spend an entertaining Saturday evening. 5/10.'\n",

            "Review: 'A young girl, Anna, analyzes a very disturbing dream with her psychologist and with the words \"finish what you started\" she is sent home from the mental institution she has been committed to for about 10 months. At first it seems that what she has been struggling with grief over her dead mother and we learn that she has died in a fire under circumstances we don't know yet. Anna has repressed her memories from that night. Anna returns home with her father who has found himself a new girlfriend who seems very hostile towards Anna. As I watched the movie I was trying to figure out if it was dealing with supernatural phenomena or if it was more in the category of a thriller. At one point I felt sure that Anna was in some sort of contact with - well what shall we call it – ghosts or undead. When everything at last (spoiler) is revealed you realize that what you have been watching for almost 1 hour and 15 minutes – is Anna's delusion more or less. Further you realize, when thinking it all through, that there was no way that you could have figured this out and this is in fact, in my view, the biggest fault in the movie. In my opinion there should have been some cues, to the observant viewer, that should have revealed when we were leaving the real world and entering the delusional. That specific episodes are fabricated by Anna's mind is acceptable but that the whole interaction with her stepmother throughout the movie is delusional is too difficult to grasp. It would seem that the psychologist who had Anna in treatment never understood how serious her condition was and apparently didn't have a clue as to the real nature of her pathology - in other words that she was psychotic.Still, if you want a good scare I would recommend this movie just don't except it to put all of what you see into a creditable story.

            "Review: 'The Uninvited is the epitome of today's, PG-13 date/horror movie. It's uncomplicated, packed with jump moments, and it has the obligatory twist at the end. If you haven't gotten thoroughly tired of this kind of thing by now, then The Uninvited might be worth the price of two movie tickets.The film mainly focuses on its trio of gorgeous female stars (Emily Browning, Elizabeth Banks and Arielle Kebbel). None of them are required to do any acting heavy lifting, but they all serve their parts well enough. The only quibble I had was with Banks, but she probably only seemed miscast because of the last few roles that I've seen and enjoyed her in.Anyway, as this is a modern, mainstream horror film, it's not very scary. The twist ending may or may not come as a surprise, but it doesn't really add much to the film. Check this out if you're a fan of any of the actresses or if you're bored. But don't expect to be frightened or particularly satisfied by The Uninvited.'\n",

            "Review: 'Based on the South Korean chiller A TALE OF TWO SISTERS, the film introduces us to troubled teen Anna as she prepares to be released from a psychiatric institution. Having witnessed the accidental death of her ailing mother, and having been saved from a subsequent suicide attempt, Anna knows that the road to recovery will be long and bumpy. Making the path more treacherous is the presence of Rachel, the mother's nursemaid who has now become Anna's father's soon-to-be wife. Already bound by their resentment of her, Anna and older sister, Alex, come to suspect Rachel of foul play when Anna is visited by ghosts.Now here's a clever thriller that is dressed up in a run-of-the-mill PG-13 Korean horror remake. It's unusual to ever see a remake to be good, although there are some exceptions, including THE RING and THE GRUDGE. Might as well add this one to the list too because THE UNINVITED is a meticulously crafted film that will have you guessing until the shocking finale. When I mean \"shocking,\" I may be exaggerating because the twist has been done before. However, the funny thing is that people keep on falling for it, or at least I think they do.What makes THE UNINVITED different from the others? Well, first of all, I loved the technical aspect of the film. I have to admit, the film is slick and shot really well. The scenery is beautiful, having a good production design. The score by Christopher Young is actually a score, and not something generic. Young, who also did the music for DRAG ME TO HELL, is one of the few composers in horror films who do a great job on the musical aspects of a film.Usually, many horror films pass the former aspect of what I've just listed (maybe not the music). However, they usually fall on the latter, that is, the story and its characters. I haven't seen the original film so I don't have any say on that, but I found the plot of the film fairly interesting and suspenseful in parts. However, the scares do get a little generic for my taste and some parts of the story are slow, but overall, it's efficient, yet ingenious.Along with the story, what holds up this film are its characters. Emily Browning does a terrific job as the lead. She makes the improbable plot look plausible and realistic. Both she and Arielle Kebbel have a great chemistry with each other. Elizabeth Banks ups the ante of the evil stepmother role. Banks proves to us that she can work with many roles, showing her comedic and sweet side in ZACK AND MIRI. David Strathairn does a decent job, although he really doesn't have much to work with in here.In general, the movie is better than most horror remakes released these days. This movie actually has an interesting plot with grounded characters and some suspenseful moments. Sure, the scares may be a little generic, relying on the score to let the audience know when something scary will happen, but it's not over-the-top. And although with its short running time, the film does suffer some slow spots, but I'm sure many would appreciate what the film has in store for the audience rather than violence, nudity, and gore.'\n",

The chick from The Uninvited has problems. I found this film slightly better than Secret Window. Just a little bit. I expected a cheap horror film. But I got a clever film that has twist after twist after twist. In the end.In The Uninvited, Anna(Emily Browning from A Series of unfortunate events, a damned good actress too)sees her mother die in an explosion. She's been staying at a hospital to cope with her mother's death.A year later, her father(David Strathairin) is engaged to Rachael(The great Elizabeth Banks, or at least I think so), the woman who was taking care of the dieing mother. Anna starts seeing terrible things and is convinced that Rachael killed her mother.So Anna and her sister Alex(The sexy Arrielle Kebell from John Tucker must die)try to prove that Rachael is a psychopath. But as we learned in A series of unfortunate events, nobody ever listens to children. The twist in the end of the film is brilliant. I mean nobody saw it coming. But, to end the review, The Uninvited was a pleasant surprise. And Emily Browning should be in more films.'\n",

The acting was good, the plot believable but then there is always this constant thought that runs through your head. Are my suspicions correct or is the director just setting me up for a twist in the end? The fact that the two sisters hated their soon to me step mom was obvious but then once the climax of the film is over and the film has reached its resolution you feel somewhat cheated by the directors in that they didn't give the audience a chance to unravel the mystery. Rather they lead you around a maize to several dead ends and then pulled a quick one on you in the end. There are also a few holes in the plot like as to how she managed to throw her boyfriend off the cliff. Also there was no mention of her sister dying in the house fire and so the audience is left feeling that they were set up from the start. I think a movie must present all facts and then deliver the 'surprise' ending and then movie goers will have some respect for it.JNR'\n",

But in general, this is a good ''beginner'' horror movie.Directing is well done here, nothing too creative, but combined with the editing it is paced really well. It does not overstay it's 83 minute runtime at all. Whilst this story is ripe for a expansive backstory and deeper levels of intricacy, it wasn't needed due to the genre it put itself in. The scares and jump-scares are fine. The visuals are pretty good. But to anyone who's seen a few horrors nothing too trippy.Music is a standout factor here, it's excellent first off. It sells the vibe and the we get sucked into that little world. Second it is the main element that helps this movie flow so well. I really enjoyed that.Acting is perfectly fine. Though is missing some intensity. Which is up to the writing and character writing as well. Which was okay. The story itself is good. Can't say anything about it but it's definitely good at keeping you hooked, how it wraps up is a bit on the quick side and some loose ends here and there do need some creative imagination to fill in. But none of them too egregious.Just a straightforward decent movie, great beginner horror.'\n",

As was The Ring. I thought the Asian versions were better BUT that didn't stop me from enjoying the remakes.

This is typically Dreamworks in style - too much \"style\" for my taste.Frankly, I'm surprised that Ebert raves about the film, giving it three stars.Of course, the directors (plural) didn't write the new script, but the direction definitely has the feel of an extended, glossy commercial, and I find that to be a distraction impossible to overlook. It's style over substance in almost every frame of the film.The acting is good, certainly. The location is stunning. So stunning, in fact, that I found myself staring at the surroundings, and paying less attention to the performances.Ultimately, this film doesn't feel \"original\" in any way. There obviously is a gimmick lurking in the background, and the \"pay-off\" is not terribly surprising.At no time did this movie evoke, in me, uneasiness or fear.

            "Review: 'The horror movie has the potential to be one of the most subversive types of films on the market—by delving into the mind and twisting reality into ways that one could describe only as psychotic, the best of the genre's output usually acknowledges the frail line that separates a sane person's temperament to that of someone not quite so stable in the head. As of late with horror movies that feature lots of shocks and jolts to the system throughout their runtime but with no substantial material to weigh their scares down, this sense of reality is too often just flat-out ditched in order to provide something surreal and paranormal. Very often the movies will try to tag on some sort of moral code or reasoning behind various gruesome scenes, haunting or what have you in order to justify it, but very rarely do they ever truly fulfil.Rather than disgruntle viewers with Yet Another Horror Movie however, the folks behind The Uninvited instead play with the crumbling walls of sanity with a subtlety that radiates throughout its structure. As a natural result, fans of your typical run-of-the-mill offering will no doubt wonder what's going on and simply be annoyed by the movie's absolute dead-end conclusion that leaves nothing to speculation or oogie-boogie men, but this isn't a fault of either of the directors. Instead the finger should be pointed to movies such as The Eye, The Grudge, One Missed Call or any other countless lukewarm cookie-cutter horror movies which have lowered people's expectations and standards when it comes to going to see a \"scary movie\". These days, kids just want to jump out their seats and be left with a sense of stoic catharsis after the hip teenagers solve the mystery of the creepy dead kids that haunt them; it doesn't matter that they seen a movie extremely similar a month ago, in fact, the closer it is to the last one the better; as long as it isn't anything like that weird Uninvited, right? You see, as much as The Uninvited sometimes plays by the Rules of the Game to a certain degree every now and then, there are segments that run throughout which go against the grain so to say and deliver a horror movie that is as scary as it is thought-provoking. While it can be hard to shake the overbearing Hand That Shakes The Cradle vibe that permeates the better part of the movie—which unfortunately goes nowhere for quite some time, it should be noted—some subtle nods to the viewers here and there allows for the veteran horror-aficionado to perhaps be caught of their guard. The movie's drawing conclusion, although not completely out of the blue—the directors tend to play hard with their characters, throwing smokes and mirrors all over the place to distract and deceive—serves as a potent reminder of the subversive, and refreshing style adopted here by the film-makers. Indeed, even though I caught the conclusion coming off a fair distance away, the final bow nevertheless packs a punch, and adds a few unexpected revelations in there too. Of course, when it comes to twists in narrative, some can betray that which comes before which leads to massive holes in plot degrading the feature as a whole, but taken in retrospect, The Uninvited undeniably becomes a better movie when the veil is lifted from the eyes.The level of enjoyment that you get out of The Uninvited doesn't solely rely on the closing act however; filled with some fitting performances, particularly of Emily Browning and a startling transformation of Elizabeth Banks, plus distinctly engrossing photography and subtle, but deadly eerie scares, The Uninvited comes off as a cut above your average horror movie, even without the psychosis undertones and clever manipulation of the viewer's tendency to align themselves with what they expect from these kinds of films (which, one could optimistically assume is why the movie has been marketed no differently). In the end however, The Uninvited exists as a rare example of a horror movie that will work a little better on a second viewing. The way it is built, ensures that audiences will be intrigued by what is on screen on a first time basis, but with layers going beyond your typical output, subversive and cerebral, there's no doubt that the movie works precisely because it draws upon the horror's movie's biggest ace in the hole; the twisting and contorting of reality seen through the eyes of insanity.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)'\n",

            "Review: 'I thought the that the film The Uninvited which was a remake of the Asian horror film, A Tale Of Two Sisters was one of the best horror films that i have seen in a long time. It is about a young teenager called Anna (Emily Browning) who tries to commit suicide after the death of her ill mother in a fire, and is sent to a mental institution for treatment. Ten months later, Anna is still cannot remember what had happened on the night her mother died. Her psychiatrist Dr. Silberling, however, discharges her telling that she has now resolved her problems Her father Steven who is a writer brings her back home in an isolated mansion nearby the coast. Anna finds that her mother's former nurse, Rachel Summers, is her stepmother now. Anna meets her sister, Alex, swimming in the sea She finds out that Steven has not delivered the letters and CDs that Alex had sent to her. later Anna is haunted by ghosts and visions and she believes that Rachel killed her mother. she and her sister Alex must try and find ways to prove the truth. I thought that this was an excellent horror film, which had a very creepy feel to it throughout I thought that Anna played by (Emily Browning) was a fantastic actress. I would really recommend anyone to see this film as it is excellent. 8/10'\n",

            "Review: 'MAJOR SPOILER ALERT My first review is prompted by the fact that I cannot believe so many people are raving about the \"surprise ending\". Possibly the most predictable twist I have seen in a movie for a long time. Within the first couple of encounters it was painfully obvious and I spent the remainder of the movie hoping that it would not be so clichéd.From the outset it was obviously not the stepmother character who was going to be guilty, simply because she was identified as the \"supposed\" villain from the outset. This, in itself, demanded that the viewer predict an alternative conclusion, and it was the most hackneyed available that they plumped for. In no time at all it was obvious that no-one acknowledged or addressed the other sister, and since all of the predictable build-up for the obvious reveal were laid out by the numbers (mentally disturbed girl with no recollection of exact events, ex-boyfriend who had witnessed the events but clearly not felt a need to report any murder to It amazes me to see so may reviews raving about a surprise ending when regular movie buffs must be so overly familiar with the gimmick by now, surely? (think Sixth Sense, Fight Club, Hide and Seek, Identity, Shutter Island, Angel Heart, etc. etc. etc. - which have provided seemingly countless and now highly repetitive variations on the same theme).Unless you are a complete stranger to the genre, or actively disengage all reasoning skills when watching a film, I would suggest disregarding any mention of the \"clever twist\" - it is rapidly becoming the single-most obvious mechanic in modern mystery thrillers. The end result involves sitting through over half a movie thinking, \"They wouldn't try to do that one again, surely?\" only to find the answer is, \"oh...they did.\" Maybe that is the twist? Although the performances and direction are adequate enough, this is a hugely disappointing exercise in lazy unimaginative scriptwriting plodding relentlessly down a far too familiar path. Please, no more seemingly innocent protagonists revealing murderous alter egos. It is already an unbelievably stale idea and does not constitute a surprise, more a sad and almost inevitable expectation.'\n",

            "Review: '\"The Uninvited\" is a remake of the 2003 Korean film \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" directed by Jee-woon Kim. Asian horror remakes are tough and usually come off as dull, boring and misinterpreted. This movie is also rated PG-13 which is a death sentence for any horror film. You usually end up getting a watered down, cliché ridden, bore fest. Although once in a great while a movie like \"The Uninvited\" comes along to challenge the theory.Starring Emily Browning and Arielle Kebble as sisters Anna and Alex. We learn that their sick mother died in a boat house explosion and Anna tried to kill herself landing her in the nut house for 8 months. She is released and comes home to find that her dad has fallen in love with his wife's nurse Rachel (played by Elizabeth Banks). She reunites with Alex and they talk about what's been happen since she's been gone. Anna becomes haunted by the people and events of her past. The sisters begin to suspect the worst in Rachel as she seems to have a dark hidden past. Their dad, played by the always reliable David Strathairn, is an accomplished author who is releasing his latest novel. When Anna's friend Matt is found dead, they suspect Rachel killed him because he saw what happen the night their mother died. Anna tries to tell their dad about Rachel, but he brushes her off and even threatens to call her psychiatrist and have her readmitted.The film is told from Anna's point of view and we see all of her delusions and fears up close. She is small and physically strong but also mentally fragile and paranoid. Emily Browning perfectly captures Anna's psyche and becomes this girl fighting back the darkness and trying to recapture her life. Fearing Rachel has now targeted the sisters for her next victims they go on the offensive to and try to expose her for what she is.\"The Uninvited\" has one of those mega twist endings, that when you re-watch the movie you realize how manipulated you were, but it is definitely a fun ride. You can see the original Korean version through Netflix Watch instantly, but will have to get the DVD if you want to see the remake. Watch this movie as part of a double feature with \"The Orphan\".'\n",

There were good scenes of the kind like the one shot in the storage room of the mini-market, the scene where she sees her mom with the bell in her hand before the cottage is burnt. The pieces of the puzzle like the invented fake name of her dad's wife which turns out at the end to be her colleague's in the mental institution.

If I had known, I probably would have been put off the American Remake and not bothered watching it – as they do have a reputation for being poor.The main problem with this movie is that it lacks any sort of atmosphere, it fails to build suspense and when it does come to the boil it leaves you cringing rather than being spooked. A big problem is that everything is revealed too early on; this kills all chances of suspense being built. With everything being revealed, everything there is a bump or Anna walks into the shadows you know what is in there and what is going to jump out. Once you have seen it, it is no longer anything to fear. There are some obvious scenes where it is really trying to build up the atmosphere and scare you but it really doesn't work, it all feels a little too predictable and leaves you thinking 'I've seen this done a thousand times'. It feels more like a thriller than a horror, and a badly done thriller at that.The acting is a mixed bag: Emily Browning (who plays Anna) gives a great performance; she is believable and makes you feel connected to the character. Elizabeth Banks (Rachel) also puts in a credible performance. However Arielle Kebbel (Alex) is quite awful, she really brings down some of the scenes with her acting.Usually 84 minutes would be a little short for a feature film but in this case it probably did it some favours. I'm sure the my rating would have dropped if this had been dragged out with a 120 minute run-time.I won't ruin it for you but the end of the movie actually saved it from an even worse rating by myself. IMDb is full of people saying how predictable it was and how they saw it coming a mile off but I didn't expect it. I am curious to see the original now and I am sure I will get round to watching it at some time.5/10'\n",

To judge it based on how it compares to the Asian version is silly, because whichever you see first tends to be the standard for judgment, giving it the advantage. While I have seen the Asian version once, I much preferred the American one, which for me was the original.\"The Uninvited\", in my opinion, is one of the best psychological horror thrillers I have seen. It is beautifully filmed, very well acted, with David Strathairn and Emily Browning as standouts. It has many hard to anticipate twists, as the directors intentionally throw the viewers off repeatedly. But some of the negative reviewers here, I believe, missed some of the details of what really transpired. SPOILER ALERT: All of the ghostly images were in Anna's dreams or hallucinations, a result mainly of the stories she heard at the mental institution. And she (Anna), while confused about reality, had planned to \"finish what she started\" regarding Dad's girlfriend. That's why she says what she did at the end. She knew all along what really happened that night, hence her suicide attempt, but wanted to block it out to protect herself from being discovered. Unless I am mistaken, many disappointed reviewers misinterpreted what was going on. Or perhaps I did, but I don't think so. I also realize some of the twists may have been done before, but that in itself does not make them bad if they are unexpected.This is the first review I have ever felt the need to issue a spoiler alert, but to say this is a ghost story or supernatural is, in my opinion, wrong. If it were, I would have watched it only once, and rated it about a 5, as I don't like movies about evil spirits or forces.'\n",

I'd recommend you see it, but if you're reading this now you'll know the twist. Still, a very creepy movie. Interestingly, both flicks center on good-evil siblings and both are directed by brothers.-- Excellent performances by the four principals in \"The Uninvited.\" Each of them is required to act under two sets of premises, what seems to be going on and what's really going on.-- Elizabeth Banks is great as Rachel. She has just enough of a sinister edge to keep you guessing (but with everything pointing to her as a killer there had to be another explanation). Still, I never figured the truth about Alex until the big reveal at the end.-- Arielle Kebbel bears an uncanny resemblance to Sally Field. Very expressive face.-- I would like to have seen an explanation of what happened at The Point.-- How did I know to rent this movie knowing nothing about it? David Strathairn does not appear in crap.-- The final two shots: Mildred closing her door and then the look on Anna's face. Perfect.-- The film comes very close to cheating a couple of times, especially the scene where the father is sitting at a desk and Alex stands in the doorway berating him.

Trust me, do not judge a book by its cover. I know from watching the trailer it doesn't seem very original; rebellious kids clashing with step-parents they're convinced are killers; but this movie is anything but cliché. It's a great blend of ghosts, mysteries, drama, and horror. You will be so glad you saw it. It is so cleverly written, and so brilliantly acted that you'll want to watch it over and over. I have, and it never gets old. I've made friends watch it, and each of them thanked me for it. You will too. Emily Browning is so great as the heroine, Anna, who is just trying to get back to her normal, teenage life. Arielle Kebbel is a great sideshow as the hilarious, sexy, more wild older sister Alex. Rachel is hard to characterize, because she is such a nice lady, yet subtly evil, the kind you can only catch when you're not sleeping with her. There are so many twists and side plots that it may seem a little muddled, but then Anna wakes up to find a trail of blood leading out of her room. The ending is so shocking and so smart that it's a little hard to grasp at first. Once it sinks in, everything all of a sudden makes sense, and you realize how intellectual and disturbing this movie actually is. It made me question my own sanity. No movie has ever done that before. Anyway, see this movie, it is awesome. 8/10'\n",

In this regard, \"The Uninvited\" breaks no new ground.Young Anna has been seemingly hospitalized in the aftermath of a horrible accident in which her mother died a fiery death. Unable to vividly remember the events in question, Anna returns home to her devoted father, her cool older sister Alex, and Rachel, her mother's former nurse. It all seems a lot to absorb, yet Anna works to absorb it indeed.That is until she is haunted by ghosts; first, of her mother, and then, of three young children who were murdered by a babysitter whose age seems to line up very fittingly with Rachel's age.As the movie progresses, Rachel's attempts to court Anna's acceptance begins to give way, and a more aggressive battle of wills pitting Anna and Alex against the woman who would be their step mother begins to develop. When their father refuses to see Rachel for what she is, and Anna's ex-boyfriend dies mysteriously before he could meet Anna and tell her what happened the night her mother died, Anna and Alex attempt to involve the police, and a bloody outcome is all but assured.Those who have looked into the details of this film already know that there is a twist ending, however it would be a shame for me to reveal the twist. Needless to say, going into this film with that understanding, I thought I'd figured out the twist pretty quickly, only to discover that I was very wrong! The ending indeed is a cut above most of the current crop of offerings within the horror genre.The film is quite well acted, and the scenes in the film are quite striking. That, combined with the payoff at the ending all make it a worthwhile experience.In the aftermath, if you're like me, you're going to start asking yourself what was with all the ghosts!

I mean the plot isn't new, the whole \"character doesn't actually exist but we don't know that until the end\" thing, as also used in The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island, and similarly but not the same as Black Swan. it's a brilliant plot twister. Despite being already used, The Uninvited does an amazing job creating a story around it. Emily Browning is amazing as Anna, portraying the sweet, innocent young girl, haunted by a tragic accident. Arielle Kebbel accents that naive innocence as the 'rebellious older sister', and being the drive Anna creates for herself to fuel her delusions.The writing is great. You're presented with little clips of WTF that get progressively telling as the movie gets closer to it's punchline, so to speak. We're first as confused as Anna, questioning what's real and who Rachel is, however as the storyline gets increasingly unstable, an eerie doubt begins to unfold, more and more horrifically and retaining the suspenseful mystery of the truth, until the final reveal.\n",
            "I must also applaud the writers for the ambiguity in the Alex + Dad interactions, written quite seamlessly and further reinforced by the later scene of Anna confronting her dad - the father's quiet nature, and letting the daughter's do all the talking. Notably the 'breakfast' scene after Matt's death is particularly impressive.As psychological thrillers go, I personally feel it's best, maybe even supposed to be, when the viewer is left with unanswered questions, as previously mentioned in Black Swan, where we are still questioning what \"really happened\" and what was in the protagonist's mind. Although I think the ending scene of the implied 'real' Mildred Kemp does well to satisfy our questions of reality, I think they could have told us less. It's pretty clear that this woman in the ward has planted these delusions in Anna's head. Which then - to me - feels like too much of a tell all. Suspense is in the unknown right? But it is satisfying to be given some resolution. And there are still plenty of spinning questions that remain after the movie has ended.Also very good music/sound effects. The creepy music box tune is absolutely perfect for the perspective of innocent, young Anna - inherently harmless but with an unavoidable omnious vibe.My only question is, why is there a giant tank of flammable liquid right beside the mother's bed, and what was Anna planning to do with a watering can full of it? Surely it would not be enough to burn the whole house down. Or did she only want to burn Rachel? Either option seems very extreme for assumably well adjusted, pre-trauma Anna.'\n",

The demon thingy going after the girl (and intimidating her) does not even make any sense , the stupid girlfriend is creepy as hell (like psychologically not in the right mind) and the girls are seen as sexual objects (like they are sexualized a lot). The dad (who likes look in the 50s) has a girlfriend that is in the 20's trying to be like Melania and trump. Getting back to the demon thing , the demon's shape is also not noticeable a lot like it just looks like a whole pile of seaweed it is just walking around or crawling around. The movie is great at selling you know what (starts with a s and ends with a x )'\n",

            "Review: 'A horror film with identity issues. The Uninvited never seems to make up its mind on whether or not it's a ghost movie or a psychological thriller. The film begins as Anna Rydell returns home after a stint in a mental institution where she was placed after her mom was killed in an accident. She is welcomed home by her sister, her father and surprise, surprise her new stepmother. Her stepmother seems too good to be true and they begin to butt heads immediately. Fortunately, Anna has her sister to confide in since her father seems indifferent to her every move. The girls begin to become suspicious of their new step mom. At the same time, Anna begins having visions of her dead mom. The Uninvited never really scares, nor does it even seem to try at times. I'm not going to give it away, but the twist ending can be spotted from a mile away if you are paying attention. The Uninvited does have some redeeming qualities. Emily Browning and Elizabeth Banks both give great performances. Browning is an actress to be watched indeed. She has such great facial expressions, that she barely needs to say anything to get her message across. Banks also shows that she can turn a good non-comedic performance. The Uninvited had some good material to work with, but where it falters is in its inability to decide which horror genre it is.'\n",

            "Review: 'The Uninvited is one of those movies where you reach the end and want to go right back to the beginning so you can view things from a different perspective. I have to admit I did not see the ending coming.I was very surprised by the mystery, development of plot and the outcome, which are clearly its strong points. It was very interesting to see all the characters evolve and understanding where everyone came from, why they acted the way they did. Also, the imagery and setting could be beautiful and eerie at the same time, which is a must have in horror movies, in my book.On the other end, as a horror movie it did have its share of clichés, which got a bit cheesy at times. I kept thinking I had seen all that stuff before – the setting, the pacing, the camera plans – and certain scenes looked very rehearsed, the main character was not natural at all. I wish the director had taken those in a different direction, although there was clearly an attempt to tone that factor down while still making them suspenseful and frightening.In hindsight, not every single thing made sense but I still find this a very entertaining, intriguing movie and I recommend it for fans of the genre.'\n",

Well to be fair, they had two details that I didn't see coming.Other than that the main character was rather dumb, she had several opportunities where if she had laid out her suspicions and listed the supporting facts then someone in authority could have checked it out and it would have all been taken care of.For all of that, the acting was good enough and the special effects creepy enough to make me at least pay attention to the end, even if I did roll my eyes a couple of times at least I didn't get totally bored.'\n",

            "Review: 'I'm thinking it was a good thing that they decided to rename this movie The Uninvited instead of A Tale of Two Sisters. That film was lyrical and almost fairy tale-esque at times with some incredibly moving moments and haunting images. While basically following the same story beats, The Uninvited is a bit more crude and slickly Hollywood. It's not exactly a negative thing as the film never insults the audience's intelligence and it's a respectable film, but something is definitely missing in translation.Both films are about a young woman who returns home to find out that her father has remarried a vain, selfish woman who might have it out for her, her father, and her sister.Elizabeth Banks is wonderful, cast against type as the wicked stepmother and Emily Browning proves once again that she's an excellent, diverse actress. It's never quite as scary or moving as the film it's based on, but it does a credible enough job bringing this story to American audiences without making fools of themselves.Not required viewing, but it's not awful.'\n",

This is a movie that comes with nice big twists, and you cannot easily predict what really is going on until you reach down to the last scene and add it all up together. This is a must watch movie that doesn't come with typical horror movie cliche's, or badly put make up on villians, or stupid, pointless animations, but a strong set of nicely shot scenes. I give it a 10/10 because it's so underrated, and as someone who encourages people to watch horror movies, I feel I must emphasise.'\n",

            "Review: 'I haven't seen that many scary movies, but one thing I know for sure. This movie is not a scary one. Suspense maybe, but not scary.About this movie: from the beginning you understand that the stepmother was not the one that made that happen. You might not know for sure, but you clearly understand that Rachel was not responsible, at least not alone (I thought Alex - Anna's sister - was also responsible for the fire). I mean, there are SO many clues and not even small ones, you start to guess that the authors want you to think Rachel did it, so you start to think otherwise.There are some good things on the movie though: for instance, I never thought Alex was dead on the fire as well, but after that revelation it makes sense: she never talks to anyone except Anna, and when she is talking to the father, he doesn't respond (and Anna is watching, so makes sense).The end was not predictable: I didn't thought Anna was going to murder her stepmother and end again in the mental Hospital. However, once she returns, you understand that the other pacient is related to the story (and in fact it is). On the other hand, as soon Anna reads her name in the internet (thinking that must be Rachel), that should have made a \"click\" on her mind... She must have read that name before I'm assuming. PS: I didn't understand the relation between the name of the movie and the movie itself...'\n",

Every horror movie that comes out...no matter how crappy it looks...i have to watch...it's just who i am. When I saw the previews to this film...saw the rating...saw that it was a remake...i said to myself \"wow...another Asian remake...and yes...it's pg-13...it's going to suck so much monkey balls...\" I was definitely wrong. This movie is not even close to as bad as The Unborn, The Grudge 2, Shutter, etc. I don't say 'The Grudge' because there were some parts of the film that were actually effective. I won't go into detail about that film as I am getting off topic.What a sigh of relief with this film allowing me to relax. The film starts out OK. When she is walking in the forest and finds the corpse in the trash bag. I thought it was pretty effective with the creepiness. But when the girl's head turned around...I thought the movie was over. It was just not needed and ruined that scene in my opinion.The story was pretty intriguing and kept my attention. There are a few twists in the film. I think the twists is what made me enjoy the movie overall. I love twists in movies though. It gives me something to think about...trying to think of the film and how I did not see the twist coming.Now for the horror fans who despise the pg-13 rating. I don't like the pg-13 horror films just like the other horror fan...but this movie surprised the h*ll out of me with the effects. There is quite a lot of blood in this film. In the film...the main character sees a trail of blood leading outside from the house. When she finds the body...OK...I won't say anymore...all I'm saying is I was pretty surprised with how graphic it was with the rating. I'm kind of excited to see that the MPAA is getting more relaxed with all this stuff.I gave this film a 7/10. There were some pretty dumb parts that made me shake my head...but not enough dumb parts for me to hate this film. This is great progress for the filmmakers who keep wanting to make these Asian remakes. Maybe one day we will get a film that overshadows 'The Ring' who some might say is the film that really started this whole trend of Asian remakes that are rated pg-13.'\n",

            "Review: 'I found The Uninvited on IMDb and saw it got an okay rating (6.4) as a horror/suspense film.(Usually I think that horror movie above 6 could give it a try) So I watched it and thought... meh.First of all, I can probably get what the director is trying to leave the audience to. I was expecting a better and more surprising plot twists than the ending gave me. It was implausible and unconvincing and made me feel that the first 90% of the movie suddenly became trash. I was confused with I finished it, then thought for a while while it gradually makes sense but still filled with tons of flaws. I really expected the director to clarify more on the ending.Secondly, I felt that the movie wasn't scary. There are some jump scares but it's just not scary. It's more suspense than it is scary. There are many scenes that could make it even scarier, but it didn't. However, I do like the cinematography, you can actually tell the difference comparing to other remakes, and The Uninvited stands out from the others.The acting was above-average. We got Emily Browning as the teenage girl who just got out from the mental hospital, Elizabeth Banks as the evil stepmother, Arielle Kebbel as the sister, and David Strathairn as the father. I especially like, Emily Browning who absolute suits the daughter and Elizabeth Banks. I really like how the two actresses interact with each other.The Uninvited is like those movies which stuck between the kick-ass movies and the suck-ass movies. It is definitely not as good as Insidious or Sinister, but is way better than the Grudge and One Missed Call. Since this is a remake, the Uninvited has lots of potential, but failed which turns it into a confusing movie. I am not saying that it is bad, I still find it quite enjoyable, but reviewing from the whole, the ending could have been way better.'\n",

While the ending is a suprise, it's cut too abruptly, it's far too short in trying to tie up some of the looser ends, and it doesn't really convince the audience. There are also some problems with the script's language that doesn't help. A keener eye would have caught some of the mishaps.

For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2/10\",\n          \"9/10\",\n          \"5/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8258673021055793,\n        \"min\": -0.9994,\n        \"max\": 0.9995,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2513,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9974,\n          -0.9955,\n          -0.9688\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          9,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8258673021055793,\n        \"min\": -0.9994,\n        \"max\": 0.9995,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2513,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9974,\n          -0.9955,\n          -0.9688\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentymenttttt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          -1,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          9,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8258673021055793,\n        \"min\": -0.9994,\n        \"max\": 0.9995,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2513,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9974,\n          -0.9955,\n          -0.9688\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
