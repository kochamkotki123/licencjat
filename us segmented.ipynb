For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2/10\",\n          \"9/10\",\n          \"5/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2/10\",\n          \"9/10\",\n          \"5/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.25252462452313573,\n        \"min\": -0.9657,\n        \"max\": 0.9945,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3286,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2832181818181818,\n          0.21169374999999996,\n          0.46381428571428573\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2/10\",\n          \"9/10\",\n          \"5/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.25252462452313573,\n        \"min\": -0.9657,\n        \"max\": 0.9945,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3286,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2832181818181818,\n          0.21169374999999996,\n          0.46381428571428573\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For a very long time, there hasnt been a horror film which can make people be scared but this was really scary. every minute you should be ready for surprises thoughout the film.\",\n          \"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \\\"accident\\\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.\",\n          \"Let me admit openly to you. I'm very surprised with The Uninvited. Given that Hollywood remakes of Asian horror films are almost universally unwatchable, I did not expect to enjoy this one at all. The Guard Brothers' film is more \\\"inspired\\\" by A Tale of Two Sisters, than it is a typical remake. Yes, our beloved South Korean masterpiece has been stripped of its unsettling presence and catered to pubescent boys. PG-13 terror sequences are spliced among teenage debauchery, but something of its parent remains. The original's method of framing hallucinations of dead people creeping out from furniture or down hallways still works. Still, as its sub-genre requires, a lot is left unexplained in The Uninvited. I don't mean good ambiguity. Think of King Kong's rampage through New York. Plot holes are that noticeable.The original film's story has been appropriately reworked, but the differences are rather pronounced. I'm still unsure about certain aspects of the plot. In this movie, there may actually be real ghosts. They appear to the younger sister this time, who is struggling over the older one's death. She convinces herself that her stepmother is a criminal who was never apprehended for previous crimes. Anna, the younger sister, repeatedly comforts herself with assurance that her older sister, Alex, is still alive. These scenes are directed well, and it isn't obvious to viewers that Alex is dead. The Uninvited is distinguished from its original film by its protagonist's motivation. Anna wants vengeance for her older sister's death, while Su-mi wants reconciliation for her inability to prevent her younger sister's death. One movie asks for sympathy with its main character, and the other one demands sympathy for supporting players. This is even more obvious because the stepmother really dies in this version.The Uninvited isn't the pinnacle of Hollywood remakes of Asian films. Too many egregious errors are obvious to anyone who has read a novel recently. Firstly, Anna confuses her stepmother for Mildred Kemp, a murderer who was never captured. The movie ends with Kemp confronting Anna, in a mental health clinic, about her experience. Anna also sees Kemp's victims' ghosts. OK, why would she do that? Unlike the first movie, most scary sequences are carried out by the ghosts. A Tale of Two Sisters infers that Su-yeon may be under the sink or in hutch. Alex, the imagined sister, is a harmless recreation that supports Anna in her revenge plot. I like the ambiguity created between ghosts and visions of deceased, but I don't think it's intentional. This movie copies its parent's greatest strengths by stumbling through an established model. It does work, but it's like listening to a backyard band sing a Beatles song and not sounding as bad as expected.A Tale of Two Sisters is a story that easily crosses cultural boundaries. I've conducted further online research since my original review and have discovered that director Kim Ji-woon based his film on a Korean folktale. In \\\"Janghwa Hongreyon jeon,\\\" a single father marries a new woman who argues with his daughters. \\\"Stepmother\\\" frames one of her stepdaughters of unchaste behavior and has her own son drown her. She also has her remaining stepdaughter killed via drowning. The spirits of the dead girls haunt local residents until someone proves they did not commit suicide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          9,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.25252462452313573,\n        \"min\": -0.9657,\n        \"max\": 0.9945,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3286,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2832181818181818,\n          0.21169374999999996,\n          0.46381428571428573\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentyment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
